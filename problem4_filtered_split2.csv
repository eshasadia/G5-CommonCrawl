about us
as the government’s housing and regeneration agency we believe that affordable, quality homes in well-designed places are key to improving people’s lives. together with our partners, we’re accelerating the pace of house building and regeneration across the country, as we seek to deliver homes and places people are proud to live in – for generations to come.
homes england
we make this happen by using our powers, expertise, land, capital and influence to:
form partnerships that bridge the gap between the public and private sector, in order to deliver new homes and regenerate places that meet local needs and aspirations
champion the creation of sustainable homes, communities and places that are brilliantly designed for the people that live there now, and in the future
support the creation of a more resilient, diverse and innovative housing sector by helping new market entrants and smes (small and medium-sized enterprises) grow, encouraging greater use of modern methods of construction and by promoting the utmost attention to building safety
it’s an ambitious and exciting agenda that can only be achieved through collaboration and commitment. whether you’re a local authority, housebuilder, investor, developer – whatever your role in the built environment, we’re your partner in housing and regeneration, and we’re here to help.

our customer complaints procedure
how you can complain about the service you get from the marine management organisation (mmo).
about mmo complaints
we are committed to our customer charter and providing a professional service to everyone that we deal with. to enable this, we need you to tell us when we get things wrong.
we define complaints as any expression of dissatisfaction about the service provided to you. we will listen to your complaints, treat them seriously and where things go wrong learn from this so that we can continuously improve our service.
you can contact us about any aspect of the service you’ve received from us, including:
mistakes that have been made
unreasonable delays
how you’ve been treated
not being kept informed
we will not investigate complaints:
about government policy or law
that have already been investigated or are currently being investigated by the parliamentary and health service ombudsman
that are, or have been, subject to legal proceedings
how to make a complaint
if you’d like to complain about any aspect of the service you’ve received from us, let the office you have been dealing with know as soon as possible. we’ll do our best to put things right.
you can contact us by email or in writing. when you contact us, please tell us:
your full name and preferred method of contact
which area of the mmo you are complaining about
what happened, when it happened and how it affected you
what you want to happen to put things right
you can send an email to info@marinemanagement.org.uk or in writing to mmo complaints, lancaster house, hampshire court, newcastle upon tyne, ne4 7yh.
the three tiers of our complaints procedure
our complaint procedure contains three stages of escalation.
tier one
this is the first opportunity for mmo to resolve your complaint and most complaints can be resolved at this point. upon receipt, we will contact the relevant team and ask them to deal with your complaint.
where possible, we will attempt to resolve your concerns by phone and will follow up all conversations in writing.
tier two
if you are dissatisfied with the initial response you may request a review by an appropriate senior lead within the relevant team. please explain the full details of why you consider that your complaint has not been addressed at tier one, and we will carry out an investigation into your concerns.
tier three
if after tier two you are not satisfied you can ask any member of parliament to refer complaints about administrative actions by the mmo to the parliamentary ombudsman (also known as the parliamentary commissioner for administration).

if your complaint relates to a breach of environmental law, you can escalate your complaint to the office for environmental protection (oep).
the two most common ways in which a public authority could fail to comply with environmental law are:
failing to take proper account of environmental law when carrying out its activities, for example not carrying out an environmental impact assessment
unlawfully exercising, or failing to exercise, any activities it has to carry out under environmental law, for example not properly regulating environmentally harmful activities it is responsible for licensing

timescales for handling complaints
tier 1 - maximum 20 working days
acknowledgement within 5 working days
full response within 20 working days
tier 2 - maximum 20 working days
acknowledgement within 5 working days
full response within 20 working days
extending the time limits
we aim to complete all complaints within the timescales above; however, if a complaint is very complex it may occasionally be necessary to extend the time limit. if this is the case, we will keep you informed of progress with the investigation, the reasons for the delay, and the new deadline.
unreasonable customer contact
we aim to provide a professional service on every occasion to all our customers. our customer charter sets out our commitment to the level of service we will provide. in return, we expect our customers to behave appropriately and treat our employees with courtesy, consideration, and respect, to allow them to carry out their work.
we recognise that sometimes things can go wrong and might need to be put right. our complaint procedure covers how we handle complaints and where necessary, what actions we take to put things right.
there will also be a small number of cases where we consider a customer, either individually or as part of a group, might be behaving in ways that we consider are inappropriate and unreasonable, despite our efforts to help.
principles and aims
this policy provides clarity for our colleagues and customers what is expected of them, what they can do, who can authorise actions and how to respond to these situations.
it also enables us to deal with unreasonable customer behaviour consistently and professionally, outlining the steps we may take to deal with such behaviours.
what is considered unreasonable behaviour?
it is difficult to produce a comprehensive list of actions we consider to be unreasonable, and cases should always be considered on their own specific merits. however, we would generally categorise unreasonable and unacceptable behaviour under two main headings.
unreasonably persistent or vexatious contact
this consists of contact (written or verbal) which we consider places an unreasonable demand on our colleague’s time.
for example, customers who:
persist in pursuing a matter when they have already exhausted other statutory routes of appeal.
do not clearly identify the precise issues which they wish to be investigated, despite reasonable efforts to help them specify their concerns.
continue to seek to pursue an issue, including complaints, where the concerns identified are not within the remit of the mmo and this has been previously explained.
persist in pursuing a complaint where our complaints procedure has been fully and properly implemented and exhausted
change in the substance of a complaint or continually raise new issues or seek to prolong contact by continually raising further concerns or questions upon receipt of a response.
remain unwilling to accept documented evidence of action despite previous engagement.
remain unwilling to accept that the mmo has reached a final decision on a chosen course of action.
deny receiving an adequate response despite previously issued correspondence specifically answering their questions
focus on trivial matters to an extent which is out of proportion to its significance and continue to focus on this point.
have has an excessive number of contacts with the mmo placing unreasonable demands on our time and resources.
adopting a ‘scatter gun’ approach. this includes pursuing parallel complaints, or other contact, on the same issue with a variety of individuals and/or teams within the mmo.
aggressive or unacceptable behaviour
this consists of behaviour (written or verbal) that might intimidate, bully, harass or offend our employees.
for example:
secretly recording meetings and conversations without advance warning.
making malicious or unjustified allegations about mmo colleagues and/or using abusive, offensive or threatening language.
any comments relating to disability, religion, belief, perceived gender of other protected characteristic.
submitting falsified documents from themselves to assist any case against the mmo.
making threatening contact, either in person, via telephone or email.
any form of physical violence, including threats to carry this out.
any form of derogatory racial, ageist, homophobic and/or sexist remarks.
actions that may be taken
before any action is taken the customer will be provided with a warning and directed to a copy of this policy. this is to provide them with an opportunity to correct their behaviour.
if the unreasonable behaviour continues, action will be taken that is considered to be proportionate to the nature and frequency of the customers contact. this will be set out in writing to the customer and the reasons for any action will be clearly explained.
the following action may be taken, taking the specific behaviour and circumstances into account:
placing limits on the number and duration of contacts with colleagues per week or month.
only addressing correspondence sent by the customer in writing and to info@marinemanagement.org.uk
banning a customer from visiting any mmo office except by appointment.
letting a customer know that the mmo will no longer reply to or acknowledge any further contact from them on a specific topic.
where an ongoing service is being provided to the customer, limiting this to the legal minimum required only.
refusing to register and process any further contact from a customer altogether, including complaints.
taking legal action against a customer where appropriate.
appeal/review
all mmo customers have the right of review, and this will be set out in any decision letter.
request for a review must be made in writing, including by email, within two weeks of the date of notification of the decision made under the policy.
we will respond to all appeals within 20 working days of receipt of the request for a review.
when we will review existing decisions to apply policy
there will be a review of existing decisions to apply the policy every 12 months.
limits will be lifted, and relationships returned to normal, unless there are good grounds to extend them.
we will inform customer of the outcome of the review. if limits are to continue, we must explain the reasons and state when the limits will next be reviewed.
you can access a pdf copy of our unreasonable customer behaviour policy at this link: mmo unreasonable customer behaviour policy - march 2022 (pdf, 703 kb, 4 pages)
complaints against an mmo appointee to an inshore fisheries conservation authority (ifca)
complaints against an mmo appointee should be directed to the chair of the ifca (or mmo representative to the ifca if the complaint is about the chair).
in the first instance, the ifca will deal with any complaint. if the ifca chair decides that the appointee has broken their terms and conditions of appointment the ifca will contact the mmo, who will investigate, and if necessary, terminate the membership of the appointee.
if a complainant does not feel that the ifca has addressed their concerns satisfactorily, they should contact the mmo at ifcas@marinemanagement.org.uk.
any evidence to support the concerns raised should be included. the mmo will then investigate, and if necessary, terminate the membership of the appointee.
complaints against an ifca
we are not responsible for the overall conduct of ifcas. an ifca is a committee of a local authority, or a joint committee of several local authorities. ifcas also report against high level objectives set by the department for environment, food and rural affairs (defra).
complaints against the overall conduct of an ifca should be directed, in the following order, to:
the chair of the ifca
the sponsoring body in the relevant local authority
the local government ombudsman
the complainant should also inform the mmo of any complaint relating to structural or systematic issues with the ifcas, which the communications team will pass on to the ifca sponsorship team in defra.

​ ​you should normally complain to the ombudsman within a year of when you first became aware of the problem. if it was more than a year ago they may still be able to help you, if there were good reasons for the delay.
​full details of what the ombudsman can look at and how to contact them are available on their website.

research at ofsted
we carry out and commission research relating to early years and education, further education and social care.
contents
research methodology
subjects we cover
our research is grouped by:
schools
early education
social care
further education and skills
research and evaluation lie at the heart of what we want to achieve as a regulator and an inspectorate. our research ensures that our inspection frameworks are based on sound evidence and tested methodologies. it also informs our future work and the areas that we inspect or regulate.
our research also enables us to fulfil our statutory duty to the secretary of state for education on informing others, including providers, about the quality of education and social care in england.
using our unique perspective through research, we also contribute to national debates.
through our evaluation work, we ensure that all our frameworks and methods are fit for purpose and are having the outcomes that we intend.
for more information on how our work is commissioned, read ‘why we do research’ by our former deputy director for research and evaluation, professor daniel muijs.
research methodology
we also do not hold a particular view on research methodology. we are pragmatic and eclectic in the methods we use, valuing both quantitative and qualitative research for the different insights that they can bring. methods follow questions in our approach.
we commission some of our research, such as our off-rolling survey, from other organisations, though we do most in-house. we typically, though not exclusively, draw on the insights from our inspectors and on inspection evidence, but we have also used questionnaires and analysis of existing data.
in our coming research and evaluation programme, we are looking to expand our methods toolbox further. across research and evaluation projects, we are committed to transparency on methods, rigour in how we work and full adherence to ethical guidelines.
subjects we cover
we have hmi specialists in the following subjects:
art and design
computing
design and technology
english (primary, secondary and cross-phase; english also includes drama)
geography
history
languages
maths (primary and secondary)
music
physical education (this includes dance)
phse, citizenship and rhse
religious education
science
social science

corporate information
responsibilities
we were responsible for:
making the public healthier and reducing differences between the health of different groups by promoting healthier lifestyles, advising government and supporting action by local government, the nhs and the public
protecting the nation from public health hazards
preparing for and responding to public health emergencies
improving the health of the whole population by sharing our information and expertise, and identifying and preparing for future public health challenges
supporting local authorities and the nhs to plan and provide health and social care services such as immunisation and screening programmes, and to develop the public health system and its specialist workforce
researching, collecting and analysing data to improve our understanding of public health challenges, and come up with answers to public health problems
we did this through world-leading science, research, knowledge and intelligence, advocacy, partnerships and providing specialist public health services.
priorities
phe’s strategic plan set out how phe intended to achieve its aims by 2025.
our business plan outlined the actions phe took to protect and improve the public’s health and reduce inequalities.
the remit letter set out the role the government expected phe to play in the health and social care system in the 2019 to 2020 financial year and the priorities for phe at that time.
who we are
we were an executive agency of the department of health and social care, and a distinct organisation with operational autonomy. we provided government, local government, the nhs, parliament, industry and the public with evidence-based professional, scientific expertise and support.
we employed 5,500 staff (full-time equivalent), mostly scientists, researchers and public health professionals.
we had 8 local centres, plus an integrated region and centre for london, and 4 regions (north of england, south of england, midlands and east of england, and london).
we worked closely with public health professionals in wales, scotland and northern ireland, and internationally.
phe was established on 1 april 2013 to bring together public health specialists from more than 70 organisations into a single public health service.

dfe as data controller
how we use your information
how to contact us and how to make a complaint
dfe’s data policies and collections
dfe as data controller
under the data protection act (dpa) and the uk general data protection regulation (uk gdpr), a data controller decides how and why personal data is processed.
the department for education (dfe) is data controller for the personal data dfe and our executive agencies process. our executive agencies are:
education and skills funding agency (esfa)
standards and testing agency (sta)
teaching regulation agency (tra)
dfe has privacy notices for each of our areas of work. these show how we use your personal information in each area.
dfe arm’s length bodies (albs) are data controllers in their own right, and have their own privacy notices.
we may sometimes change this document, and we encourage you to check it from time to time.
dfe’s personal information charter
this charter sets out what you can expect from us when we hold your personal information. we will follow all applicable uk data protection laws, including the data protection principles.
the personal information we hold about you will be:
used lawfully, fairly and in a transparent way
collected only for valid purposes that we have clearly explained to you and not used in any way that is incompatible with those purposes
relevant to the purposes we have told you about and limited only to those purposes
accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date
kept only as long as necessary for the purposes we have told you about
kept securely
dfe privacy notices show how we use your personal information in each of our areas of work.
how we collect your personal information
we receive your personal information indirectly from other organisations. for example, we collect information about:
you, your learning and your achievements etc - we collect this information from early years providers, schools, academies, independent schools, colleges and training providers, we sometimes refer to these as ‘educational settings’, we also collect this information from your employer, if applicable
children in need, children looked after and alternative provision - we collect this information from local authorities
you to support research and to safeguard children - we collect this information from other government departments, early years providers, schools, academies, independent schools, colleges and training providers
your exam results - we receive this from awarding organisations and exam boards
teachers and employees in educational settings or local authorities - we collect this information from the educational setting or local authorities
more details are available of how we collect this information through our school and college and further education data collections, such as the school census.
we may also collect information directly from you:
over the telephone, like when you contact our helpdesks
in correspondence that you send to us, like emails, letters and social media posts
details of your visits to our website including the resources that you access
when you subscribe to our mailing lists
storing your personal information outside the uk
when dfe stores personal information outside the uk, we will make sure we keep it safe.
most personal information we collect and use is stored on systems in the uk and eu.
on occasion, your information may leave the uk or eu:
to get to another organisation
if it is stored in a system outside the eu
details of these transfers can be found in the data-subject privacy notices.
when this happens, we make sure the country it is sent to has the required level of data protection. we also take additional steps to protect your information including:
making sure it is transferred securely
there is a contract in place which ensures the recipient will protect your information
where we have to send personal information to a country without an adequacy decision, we carry out due diligence to ensure that the transfer is made in accordance with uk data protection legislation.
automated decision making and profiling
dfe sometimes uses automated processing in some decision making to help us deliver efficient services. we will not make any decision based solely on automated processing which has a significant effect on you unless the law specifically allows this.
profiling involves the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects such as a person’s:
performance at work
economic situation
health
personal preferences
interests
reliability
behaviour
location or movements
we will sometimes use profiling where there is a clear benefit for doing so. dfe examples of profiling may include:
to avoid asking for information or evidence that we do not need, and make sure we ask for it when necessary
to improve our services and to support the achievement of our objectives
to detect and prevent fraud and error
your rights
the uk gdpr gives you certain rights about how your information is collected and used.
these include:
the right to be informed about the collection and use of your personal data – this is called ’right to be informed’
the right to ask us for copies of your personal information we have about you – this is called ’right of access’, this is also known as a subject access request, data subject access request or right of access request
the right to ask us to change any information you think is not accurate or complete – this is called ‘right to rectification’
the right to ask us to delete your personal information – this is called ‘right to erasure’
the right to ask us to stop using your information – this is called ‘right to restriction of processing’
the ‘right to object to processing’ of your information, in certain circumstances
rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling
the right to withdraw consent at any time (where relevant)
the right to complain to the information commissioner if you feel we have not used your information in the right way
there are legitimate reasons why we may refuse your information rights request, which depends on why we are processing it. for example, some rights will not apply:
right to erasure does not apply when the lawful basis for processing is legal obligation or public task
right to portability does not apply when the lawful basis for processing is legal obligation, vital interests, public task or legitimate interests
right to object does not apply when the lawful basis for processing is contract, legal obligation or vital interests. and if the lawful basis is consent, you don’t haven’t the right to object, but you have the right to withdraw consent
dfe privacy notices provide details of your rights and the lawful basis for each processing activity.
for more information, see the ico’s guide to individual rights.
see requesting your personal information for more on what you’re entitled to ask us, or any of our executive agencies, and your rights about how your information is collected and used.

cookies
cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. they are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.
dfe uses necessary cookies to make our websites work. necessary cookies enable core functionality such as security, network management and accessibility. each website with cookies on it will have a cookie banner with details.
cookies are used to:
measure how you use this service so it can be updated and improved based on your needs
remember who you are if you return to your saved results so we can show you your information and information relevant to you
cookies aren’t used to identify you personally. we record tracking information anonymously, so cookies do not track your personal data, only your activity on the site.
find out more about cookies on gov.uk.
each dfe website will have details about the specific cookies that are used on that site or social media channel.
sharing your personal information
we will only share your personal data with others where it is lawful, secure and ethical to do so. where these conditions are met, we can share your personal information with:
schools and other education providers
local authorities
researchers (like universities, think tanks, research organisations)
organisations connected with promoting the education or wellbeing of children in england
organisations fighting or identifying crime (like police, courts, home office)
other specified crown and public bodies (like ofqual, ofsted, ucas, office for students)
organisations working for dfe under contract (like dfe commissioned research or training providers)
organisations who provide careers and other guidance
organisations who provide statistics and research about education, training, employment and well-being, including jisc (formerly the higher education statistics agency or ‘hesa’) as detailed in jisc’s collection notices. your data is also submitted to jisc so that you can take part in the graduate outcomes survey
dfe shares personal data where this is a benefit to education, the children’s services sector or it is in the interests of the wider public or society - such as sharing data to fight crime or for policy development.
how dfe shares personal data gives details of the protections dfe has in place when sharing your data and the relevant legislation.
our data sharing approval panel must approve all data share requests. the panel of experts assesses each application for public benefit, proportionality, legal underpinning and strict information security standards. the panel has external members who analyse decisions to increase public trust in the data share process.
dfe will only share data with a third party where we have a lawful basis for the data share under article 6(1) of the uk gdpr. in most cases, we rely on article 6(1)(e) ‘public task’ as the lawful basis where the task or function has a clear basis in law or 6(1)(f) ‘legitimate interest’ where the sharing of your data does not override your rights or when you expect us to share your data. but we will review each data share request on a case-by-case basis to ensure the right lawful basis is used. see the ico guide to lawful basis for processing for more details.
for example, we share data under public task with:
awarding organisations – to allow exam outcomes to be accurately predicted
children’s commissioner’s office - to protect and promote the rights and interests of children in england, especially the most vulnerable
fraud prevention and law enforcement agencies such as the police and the national crime agency - to prevent and detect fraud in the funding of education and learning
home office - to prevent abuse of immigration control
police and criminal investigation authorities, through court orders - to safeguard and promote welfare of children in the uk
for example, we share data under legitimate interest with:
education policy institute - to identify if government policies are delivering a high-quality education system
national foundation for educational research and scottish qualifications authority - to investigate developments to the national curriculum
full details of who we share data with are available.

accessible documents policy
this policy explains how accessible the documents nuclear decommissioning authority publishes on gov.uk are.

what we’re doing to improve accessibility
there’s guidance to help you check the accessibility of documents.
this policy explains how the nuclear decommissioning authority publishes accessible documents on gov.uk. it covers pdfs, spreadsheets, presentations and other types of document. it does not cover content published on gov.uk as html. the main gov.uk accessibility statement covers this.
using our documents
the nuclear decommissioning authority (nda) publishes documents in a range of formats, including pdf, open standards format, ms excel and ms word.
because we want as many people as possible to be able to use those documents, when we produce a document we will:
provide an html option where possible
tag headings and other parts of the document properly, so screen readers can understand the page structure
make sure we include ‘alt text’ alongside non-decorative images, so people who cannot see them understand what they’re there for
avoid using tables, except when we’re presenting data
write in plain english
accessibility of our documents
new documents that we publish, and documents you need to download, should be fully accessible.
however, we know that some of our older documents (published before 23 september 2018) are not accessible for a number of reasons, including:
some are not tagged properly - for example, they do not contain proper headings or alt text
some contain tables that include text rather than data
some contain technical content that may not be written in plain english
this mostly applies to our corporate reports and attached files. we are continuing to work hard to make all of our documents as accessible as possible.
but, if you need to access information in one of these document types, you can contact us and ask for an alternative format.
what to do if you cannot use one of our documents
if you need a document we’ve published in a different format:
email enquiries@nda.gov.uk
call 01925 802001
we will consider the request and get back to you in 7 days.
reporting accessibility problems with one of our documents
we are always looking to improve the accessibility of our documents. if you find any problems not listed on this page or you think we are not meeting accessibility requirements, contact: enquiries@nda.gov.uk
enforcement procedure
the equality and human rights commission (ehrc) is responsible for enforcing the public sector bodies (websites and mobile applications) (no. 2) accessibility regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). if you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the equality advisory and support service (eass).
technical information about the accessibility of our documents
the nda is committed to making our documents accessible, in accordance with the public sector bodies (websites and mobile applications) (no. 2) accessibility regulations 2018.
the documents the nuclear decommissioning authority publishes are not compliant with the web content accessibility guidelines version 2.1 aa standard. the non-accessible sections are listed below.
non accessible content
the content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
non compliance with the accessibility regulations
a few of our documents have diagrams. these images do not have a text alternative, so the information in them is not available to people using a screen reader. this does not meet wcag 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).
when we publish new documents we will make sure our use of diagrams meets accessibility standards. a few of our documents are not created with headings. these documents are not structured logically, so the information in them cannot be navigated by people using a screen reader. this does not meet wcag 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (info and relationships).
when we publish new documents we will make sure our use of headings meets accessibility standards.
disproportionate burden
content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations
many of our older pdfs and word documents do not meet accessibility standards - for example, they may not be structured so they’re accessible to a screen reader. this does not meet wcag 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (name, role value).
the accessibility regulations do not require us to fix pdfs or other documents published before 23 september 2018 if they’re not essential to providing our services. for example, we do not plan to fix our earlier annual reports and accounts.
any new pdfs or word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.
how we tested our documents
we last tested a sample of our documents on 20 september 2019. the test was carried out by nuclear decommissioning authority.
we tested:
a pdf
ms word document
a spreadsheet
what we’re doing to improve accessibility
we are ensuring that all authors of documents that we publish externally are aware of the requirements to create accessible document, and we are training employees responsible for creating and publishing documents so that they can check that all future publications meet accessibility standards.
this page was prepared on 20 september 2019. it was last updated on 23 september 2020.

how we process your personal data
uk procurement law
we must follow uk laws that govern how we may buy goods, services and works over a specified value or ‘threshold’.
where we expect the estimated value of a contract to be over the relevant threshold, we must advertise our requirements on the find a tender service (fts).
the procurement thresholds are published by the cabinet office.
transforming public procurement (tpp)
in december 2020, the cabinet office published the green paper ‘transforming public procurement’ which set out significant reforms aimed at speeding up and simplifying public procurement. the development and implementation of these reforms is owned and managed by the cabinet office.
the transforming public procurement programme aims to improve the way public procurement is regulated in order to:
c​reate a simpler and more flexible, commercial system that better meets our country’s needs while remaining compliant with our international obligations
open up public procurement to new entrants such as small businesses and social enterprises so that they can compete for and win more public contracts
embed transparency throughout the commercial lifecycle so that the spending of taxpayers’ money can be properly scrutinised
the procurement bill, which will reform the existing procurement rules, has now received royal assent. you can view the new procurement act on the uk legislation website, and the official record of the bill’s progress through parliament, with all supporting documents on the parliamentary website.
visit the designated tpp page to find out more about how public procurement will change to improve the way supplies, services and works are procured for the public sector.
latest contracting opportunities
we, and our executive agencies, advertise new contracting opportunities in the following places, where appropriate:
the uk e-notification service, find a tender (fts)
dfe’s research page
contracts finder
specialist publications, and trade, national and local press
jaggaer
forthcoming opportunities
we use a variety of means to notify suppliers of future opportunities, including:
advertising prior information notices (pin) on the fts website
publishing notices on contracts finder
publishing opportunities to tender on jaggaer
department for education commercial pipeline data: 2020 to 2021
duns numbers
‘duns numbers’ provide us with valuable information about which suppliers are bidding for our contracts. we encourage interested suppliers to register with duns numbers.
prompt payment policy
we follow government policy and pay all correctly submitted invoices within 10 days of receiving them at the physical or electronic address that we’ve specified.
educational and children’s social care professionals dynamic purchasing system (ecsc dps)
the education and children’s social care dynamic purchasing system (ecsc dps) has moved to the jaggaer commercial platform.
we use the ecsc dps to buy professional, educational and children’s social care services to support government policy in schools and local authorities.
if you would like to apply to join the ecsc dps, you can do so by logging in or registering on the jaggaer portal.
as a potential supplier you should register with jaggaer and apply to join the ecsc dps so that you can:
apply to become a member of the ecsc dps
view ecsc dps opportunities to tender
submit ecsc dps tender responses
prior to 22 december 2020, the dfe used redimo2 to host the ecsc dps. all ecsc dps members who gained approval prior to the 22 december 2020 will be migrated to jaggaer with their membership status retained.
further information on how this will be managed and any action required has been issued directly to existing members.
for any queries, please email the commercial contact point team.
commercial contact point team
email commercial.contactpoint@education.gov.uk
terms and conditions for using the ecsc dps

standard terms and conditions for dfe contracts
if you would like to know which terms and conditions apply when bidding for a particular dfe contract, contact the person named in the advertisement and tender documentation.
generally, we use the cabinet office short form, mid-tier and model services contract terms and conditions which are regularly updated. we may augment these terms with a small number of dfe specific terms and conditions.
where buying from a framework we use the corresponding crown commercial service framework terms and conditions. again, we may augment these terms with a small number of dfe specific terms and conditions.
purchase orders
our purchase orders (documents that ask a company to supply goods and give details of price, method and date of payment) are subject to our terms and conditions for goods (pdf, 148 kb, 8 pages).
key performance indicators (kpis) for government’s most important contracts
you can now view a list of central government’s most important contracts, showing up to 4 relevant key performance indicators (kpis) for those contracts, and the performance of the vendor against those kpis.
small and medium enterprises (smes)
our aim is to maximise opportunities for smes to participate in our procurement opportunities, by encouraging competition and reducing barriers to participation wherever possible.
we encourage smes to work with us directly or as part of the supply chain by:
having a tender process that treats smes fairly and by trying to keep our tender documents simple
supporting commercial relationships between the department and smes and smes and larger organisations
monitoring our sme spend and reporting to cabinet office for publication
opportunities for smes
we advertise new opportunities on contracts finder.
we also run innovation days where suppliers can meet each other and showcase what they offer. we advertise these on linkedin and twitter.

how we procure and support smes
the progress made so far

overview
under the equality act 2010, we have a legal duty to publish information that shows compliance with the public sector equality duty, and to publish our equality objectives.
equalities in policymaking and delivery
equality and diversity are critical to delivering dfe’s vision: we enable children and learners to thrive by protecting the vulnerable and ensuring the delivery of excellent standards of education, training and care. this helps realise everyone’s potential – and that powers our economy, strengthens society and increases fairness.
specific examples of our equality analysis
to deliver on our wider equality and diversity objectives, we invest in excellent analysis and research, some good-practice examples of which are provided here.
equality impact assessments:
higher education reform: equality impact assessment
school rebuilding programme: equalities impact assessments
reception baseline assessment: equality impact assessment

about us
as the government’s housing and regeneration agency we believe that affordable, quality homes in well-designed places are key to improving people’s lives. together with our partners, we’re accelerating the pace of house building and regeneration across the country, as we seek to deliver homes and places people are proud to live in – for generations to come.
homes england
we make this happen by using our powers, expertise, land, capital and influence to:
form partnerships that bridge the gap between the public and private sector, in order to deliver new homes and regenerate places that meet local needs and aspirations
champion the creation of sustainable homes, communities and places that are brilliantly designed for the people that live there now, and in the future
support the creation of a more resilient, diverse and innovative housing sector by helping new market entrants and smes (small and medium-sized enterprises) grow, encouraging greater use of modern methods of construction and by promoting the utmost attention to building safety
it’s an ambitious and exciting agenda that can only be achieved through collaboration and commitment. whether you’re a local authority, housebuilder, investor, developer – whatever your role in the built environment, we’re your partner in housing and regeneration, and we’re here to help.
you can read about our mission and our strategic objectives in our strategic plan.

dcms publication scheme
classes of information
official requests for information
environmental information regulations
crown copyright and licensing
you don’t need to make a freedom of information (foi) request for information published under the scheme.
dcms publication scheme
here you will find information that has been proactively released by dcms under the terms of the freedom of information act 2000. most of the information covered by the dcms publication scheme will be made available on this site. if you need information in an alternative format, we will do all we reasonably can to help.
our publication scheme follows the information commissioner’s model publication scheme for public authorities.
classes of information
all of the information is set into ‘classes’. these classes are:
who we are and what we do
most of this information can be found on our department page and includes:
roles and responsibilities of department and staff at senior level
our sponsored bodies
dcms organisation chart
our ministers
how to contact us
what we spend and how we spend it
this can be found using a search of all our transparency data, and includes:
resource accounts
dcms business costs
pay and grading
procurement procedures
what our priorities are and how we are doing
this includes:
‘strategic reform plan’
research
statistics
how we make decisions
this includes:
public consultations
our policies and procedures
this includes information on:
dcms vacancies
the services we offer
publications
advice and guidance
press releases
charging for information
our aim is to make as much information as possible available free of charge.
at present there will be no charge for information available on this website. published documents, for example legislation, will have links to the appropriate website where a charge may be made. where a charge is applicable this will be indicated with a pound sign ‘£’.
a paper copy of the information contained on this website (including paper copies of reports available in electronic form) is available on request. our online contact form is the best way to contact us.
official requests for information
before making an foi request, it is worth checking to see if the information is already available via the publication scheme. if you cannot find the information you require after searching the publication scheme, you may have to submit a request for information.
this must be submitted in writing to:
freedom of information team
department for culture, media and sport
100 parliament street
london sw1a 2bq
email: foi@culture.gov.uk
be specific
you will get the information faster if you help us identify the exact information you require. it will also mean that your request is less likely to be turned down on cost grounds. make sure that you:
are specific about exactly what information you want
provide us with a narrow, tightly focused request
give, where appropriate, a relevant time frame the information relates to

terms & conditions
dcms is a very small, policy-orientated department. contracts and purchasing are organised centrally within the department. our arm’s length bodies undertake their own contracts and purchasing activity. the majority of our central support services are outsourced to other government organisations, including our core information technology requirements. we do not keep preferred supplier lists.
the commercial team can be contacted by email: commercial@dcms.gov.uk
public procurement (eu) regulations
as with other government departments and many other public bodies, dcms is obliged to follow the relevant public procurement regulations. the most recent regulations applicable are the public contracts regulations 2015.
these regulations set value thresholds for contracts, above which certain procedures must be applied to the tendering and award of contract. for dcms, these thresholds are presently set at:
goods - £106,047
services - £106,047
works - £4,104,394
the regulations set out rules relating to advertising the requirement by way of a notice in the official journal of the european union (ojeu) including:
the manner in which tenders may be sought
minimum timescales for tendering
the criteria which may and may not be applied to the selection of tenderers, and
the contractor and technical specifications that may be applied
procurement policy
we are fully committed to government policy on procurement as set out in guidance from the cabinet office under the crown commercial services (ccs).
this has 2 basic objectives:
to achieve continuing improvement in value for money based on whole-life cost and quality
to enhance the competitiveness of suppliers through the development of procurement systems and practices
we are also committed to developing the use of e-procurement as a way of improving efficiency.
our procurement strategy
wherever possible and cost effective we make use of central framework arrangements set up by crown commercial service or by other government departments.
where a suitable framework agreement is not available:
multiple quotations are sought for requirements with an estimated value between £5,000 to £10,000 (ex vat)
requirements with an estimated value of more than £10,000 (ex vat) will be advertised via contracts finder, where applicable
requirements with an estimated value of more than £100,000 (ex vat) will be advertised via the official journal of the european union (ojeu), where applicable
all requirements go through the commercial team.
while individual tendering procedures will be tailored to the specific needs of the contract there are some general principles that we seek to apply:
specifications will focus on the required output
all tenderers will have the same chance and be treated fairly and equally
tender documents will be clear and easy to understand
over specification will be avoided
client contractor relationship
in all dealings with dcms, officials will seek to preserve the highest standards of integrity, objectivity, fairness, efficiency and professionalism. in turn, we expect contractors to meet these same standards.
ethics in procurement require high standards of conduct which ensure that the probity of officials and the propriety of their actions is above question. this means that:
all dealings with officials should be fair and even-handed
all of our contracts contain provisions relating to corrupt gifts
sustainable procurement
we are committed to adopting good environmental practice. while always ensuring best value for money, procurement can play a vital role in assisting green policy objectives.
some of the ways in which the department incorporates environmental factors into purchasing decisions are:
wherever possible, when specifying goods, ensuring that less environmentally damaging products are specified. a simple example would be when ordering furniture, any woods used should be from either a recycled wood products or from a sustainably grown sources
calculating the whole life cost of specifying an environmentally friendly product
under ec procurement directives, tenderers will not be excluded from bidding on non-economic grounds. tenderers can be excluded if they fail to meet specific green procurement requirements, but not because of other general environmental considerations.
tenders
evaluation of tenders
if you are tendering for a contract with dcms, you will be informed of the broad evaluation criteria used for assessing bids as part of the tender documentation. bids are usually assessed on the ‘most economically advantageous tender’ which includes both technical / quality and pricing factors.
all tenderers are assessed against the same criteria. this might involve you attending a presentation or interview where you can present your bid in more detail, or we can seek clarification. we award a contract as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.
unsuccessful tenders
within the limits of some commercial confidentiality, the department will always offer unsuccessful tenderers the reasons why their bid failed. such debriefing can be by phone or face to face.
this should be viewed as a 2-way process.
the comments from the department should be viewed as constructive. they are aimed at making unsuccessful tenderers aware of certain weaknesses and strengths and enabling them to better compete for future work.
dcms commercial pipeline
the dcms commercial pipeline can be viewed dcms commercial pipeline published march 2023 (pdf, 250 kb, 5 pages). the pipeline is an indicative 24 month forward look of potential commercial activity to be undertaken by the department but may be subject to change. all enquiries regarding the pipeline information should be sent to commercial@dcms.gov.uk.
terms & conditions
dcms use a suite of standard terms and conditions proportionate to the requirement, which are issued to potential tenderers as part of the tender documentation.
dcms issue purchase orders (pos) to support all contracts, as part of our purchase to pay (p2p) system.
where purchases are not supported by a specific written contract, the po includes dcms standard terms and conditions (pdf, 166 kb, 2 pages).
for any queries please contact commercial@dcms.gov.uk.

guidance on how to complain
before you make a complaint
contact the office you’ve been dealing with
ask for your complaint to go to a senior manager
wait for our final response
contact the independent case examiner
1. before you make a complaint
you can make a complaint if you’re unhappy with the service provided by dwp, for example if:
mistakes have been made
there were unreasonable delays
you feel you’ve been treated poorly
you haven’t been kept informed
a complaint is defined as any expression of dissatisfaction about the service provided which is not resolved by operational staff as normal business.
we will not investigate complaints:
about government policy or law
that have already been investigated or are currently being investigated by the independent case examiner or the parliamentary and health service ombudsman
that are, or have been, subject to legal proceedings, including legal settlements
challenge or appeal a benefit decision
you cannot make a complaint to challenge a benefit decision (this is known as a ‘mandatory reconsideration’) or appeal against a benefit decision, overpayment decision, child maintenance assessment or sanction.
read about how to request a mandatory reconsideration of a benefits decision.
if you disagree with the decision in a mandatory reconsideration notice, you can appeal to the social security and child support tribunal.
state pension age changes
at present, we are not investigating complaints about 1950s women and state pension age changes.
we stopped investigating these complaints on 30 november 2018 when the issue went before the high court. both the high court and the court of appeal have given judgment on this matter, in favour of the government. the supreme court refused permission to appeal but the claimants have 6 months from the date of that decision to appeal to the european court of human rights.
in the meantime, the parliamentary and health service ombudsman began an investigation. dwp will not investigate a matter that is being considered by the ombudsman.
if you have already complained to us, we will write again to inform you of the next steps.
we will continue to investigate complaints not related to state pension age changes under the normal dwp complaints procedure.
2. contact the office you’ve been dealing with
if you’d like to complain about any aspect of the service you’ve received, let the office you have been dealing with know as soon as possible.
you can contact them by phone, in person or in writing. universal credit claimants can also use their journal.
you need to let them know:
your national insurance number – unless you are an employer
your full name, address and contact numbers
which benefit you are complaining about
what happened, when it happened and how it affected you
what you want to happen to put things right
if we’ve made a mistake, we’ll put it right as soon as possible and apologise immediately. if you’ve experienced unfair treatment or suffered financially, we may consider making a special payment to you.
who to contact
use the contact details at the top of any recent letters we’ve sent you or the contact details below.
if you live in northern ireland, go to the department for communities website for more information.
to complain about an organisation that provides dwp services, for example employment programmes or health assessment providers, contact them directly. if you don’t agree with their response, they will tell you how to take things further.

dwp is taking steps to make sure we can continue to deliver essential services, while protecting the wellbeing of our staff and our customers.
our priority is to make sure customers continue to receive their payments and to process new benefit claims.
unfortunately, this may affect the delivery of some other services. this includes responding to complaints, which may take us longer than usual. in these exceptional circumstances, we ask anyone who has already submitted a complaint to be patient and we will respond to you as soon as we can.
4. wait for our final response
you will receive a final response by telephone or letter from the dwp complaints team. this will tell you the outcome of your complaint, and how to contact the independent case examiner if you are not satisfied.
5. contact the independent case examiner
you must have had a final response from the dwp complaints team before you contact the independent case examiner.
if you’re not happy with the final response from the dwp complaints team, you can ask the independent case examiner to look at your complaint.
you must contact them within 6 months of getting the final response from the dwp. they may ask to see a copy of your final response, if you received it by letter.

if you’re not satisfied
the complaints process
there are 3 stages to our complaints process:
the team or our contact centre.
response from customer service team.
escalation to the head of service delivery.
what complaints we can help with
this process deals with complaints about:
the accuracy of information on the companies register
the level of service we’ve provided
there are separate procedures if you want to:
complain about a limited company
report fraud about a company
we do not deal with consumer rights complaints about goods or services.
how to complain about companies house
email your complaint to companies house.
you must:
explain the problem
give as much information as you can
tell us what you want to happen
what happens next
a member of companies house will reply in writing or by telephone within 10 working days.
if we cannot give a full response in this time, we’ll tell you what we’re doing and when you can expect a full reply. this might happen if your complaint needs more detailed investigation. we’ll give a contact name and a complaint reference number.
if you’re not satisfied
ask us to review your complaint at the next stage of the process.
our customer service team will review your complaint and respond.
in some situations we may not be able to help you, for example, if you’re not happy about a legal requirement and escalation will not change the outcome.
at stage 3, the head of operational delivery will respond.
this is the final stage and completes our internal complaints process.
independent complaint adjudicators
if your complaint is not resolved, you can ask us to refer your complaint to the independent adjudicators. you must finish the internal complaints process first.
our customer services team can refer your complaint. we’ll tell you about this in more detail if you reach this stage.
the adjudicators only investigate complaints about:
level of service
mistakes
our complaint handling
your complaint must be less than 6 months old.
if you’re not happy with the adjudicators’ decision, you can ask your mp to take your complaint to the parliamentary and health service ombudsman.

our objectives
what we’re doing

our objectives
our 3 overarching equality, diversity and inclusion objectives are:
an inclusive workplace: ‘a workplace that is inclusive and flexible, and where everyone is treated fairly and with respect’
a diverse workforce: ‘a workforce that is reflective of our diverse society at all grades’
fair and accessible services: ‘fair treatment, fair outcomes and equal access for all our service users’
what we’re doing
moj is working hard to achieve a more inclusive workplace where staff are encouraged to be themselves and deliver their best at work.
we are also determined to build a workforce that is more representative of the uk’s diverse communities and communities of interest.
we know that by achieving these two objectives, we will be best placed to support our third objective: the delivery of fair and accessible services to all those who use them, and to those who come into contact with the criminal justice system.
we protect all employees and members of the public accessing our services from discrimination in the workplace as set out in the equality act 2010.
but more broadly, we create an inclusive culture where all staff and our service users are treated with respect for who they are and what they do regardless of their:
age or perceived age
disability, long-term illness or health status
sex
gender, gender identity or expression
race (including colour, ethnic origin, nationality or national origin)
religion or belief or non-belief
sexual orientation
marriage and civil partnership status
pregnancy and maternity status
social or educational background
or any other characteristic or attribute
increasing diversity representation at all levels and equality of opportunity for everyone
we have a number programmes and initiatives to address under-representation and ensure equality of opportunity for everyone, including:
access to mentoring opportunities
keeping our recruitment and performance management processes under review for disproportionate outcomes and developing interventions where necessary
introducing positive action programmes to build skills and confidence, and realise the potential of under-represented employees such as those who identify as bame, disabled or lgbtqi 
we report back on outcomes related to the above in our annual workforce monitoring report and in other publications such as the gender pay gap report
improving inclusion and valuing difference
we aim to build an inclusive workplace that supports the wellbeing of our staff and values and champions difference as a strength, encouraging staff to be themselves and deliver their best at work. our interventions include:
building strong networks and communities of support and advocacy
we offer support and advice to employees and senior leadership through diversity staff networks for race, disability, gender, lgbtqi, faith, carers, job sharers, menopause, eu nationals, and parents. we are also actively involved in wider networks across the civil service. in addition to this we have communities of staff taking on advocacy and support roles such as race ambassadors, a forum for those experiencing domestic violence, bullying and harassment advisors and mental health allies. our networks and communities work in partnership with the department ro drive change and support workplace inclusion where needed by providing advice and guidance, hosting discussion forums and encouraging consultation and helping raise awareness.
encouraging flexible working
we offer a range of job-sharing, part time and other working patterns. our smarter working practices help us to become a more open, dynamic and modern organisation that fosters creativity, efficiency and collaboration. by balancing the freedom to choose with the responsibility to meet business needs, we want to encourage a culture focused on outputs over presence, with increased wellbeing for all our people.
support visibility and inclusion through partnership working, events and role modelling
we encourage role models and allies across all our diverse groups, and a strong track record of delivery in driving inclusion through policy development, project delivery, events and awareness raising and working collaboratively with stakeholders both within and outside government. our work in this area has been recognised in its benchmark placings in the stonewall top 100 (lgbtqi inclusion), working families benchmark, the social mobility foundation employer index and the best employers for race.
increase social mobility
we have a social mobility strategy and its key focus is outreach activity. at the heart of this is the moj schools programme, which encourages volunteers to work with pupils from deprived backgrounds to increase awareness, build confidence and improve the potential outcomes of young people as they transition from school to employment.
building diversity and inclusion in all that we do
we have made delivering on diversity and equality everyone’s responsibility. we have training and polices in place to ensure our services are inclusive in respect of age, disability, sex, gender identity or expression, race, religion or belief, sexual orientation, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity status, social background or any other characteristic or attribute.
the executive board has an overall champion and each board member leads on a diversity characteristic, supported by a team of senior civil servant diversity champions across the organisation.
everybody at moj is encouraged to understand and address the diverse needs of the communities we serve. we help people deliver roles fairly and inclusively, and in accordance with equality law, by offering learning and training.
we provide confidential support and assistance to deal with bullying, harassment and discrimination, including trained bullying and harassment advisers, access to an employee assistance programme and comprehensive staff guidance.

personal information charter

cymraeg
this notice sets out how we handle your personal data and how we comply with the requirements of the uk general data protection regulation (gdpr).
companies house
contents
if you’re an officer of a company or other corporate entity, or a beneficial owner of an overseas entity
if you’ve contacted us with a complaint or enquiry
if you’re a subscriber to our web services
if you’re a subscriber to our communication channels
searchers of the public register
if you’re an officer of a company or other corporate entity, or a beneficial owner of an overseas entity
this section of the privacy notice sets out how the registrar of companies (the registrar) handles the personal data of officers of companies and other corporate entities.
it also sets out how the registrar handles the personal data of beneficial owners of overseas entities. it then sets out how the registrar ensures that the public register of companies (the register) and register of overseas entities (roe) comply with the requirements of the uk general data protection regulation (uk gdpr).
any references to ‘registers’ covers both the register of companies and roe.
see our guidance for more information on the companies house register and how to protect your personal data.
identity of controller and data protection officer (dpo)
the registrar is the controller of your personal data. this means it’s the registrar who decides how and why your personal data is processed.
the companies act 2006 requires the registrar to collect and publish information, including the personal data of officers of companies and other entities, on the register. the registrar is also required to collect similar information on roe by the economic crime (transparency and enforcement) act 2022.
in certain circumstances (for example, if an individual or company is being investigated for a criminal offence) the controller may be our sponsoring department, the department for business and trade (dbt). companies house is an executive agency of dbt and many of the day-to-day controller responsibilities have been formally delegated to companies house.
purpose for processing
personal data featuring on the public register of companies or roe is processed for the purpose of making data available for public inspection under a statutory obligation. the registrar’s legal basis for processing is described in more detail below.
lawful basis for processing
the register of companies
the registrar is required by the companies act 2006 to make certain information, including personal data, publicly available.
part 35 of the companies act 2006 sets out the registrar’s obligations, including the requirement to make information, including personal data, available for public inspection. it also sets out many of the requirements for handling personal data - including how it can be rectified in certain circumstances, and how inaccuracies can be amended.
the register of overseas entities (roe)
the registrar is required by the economic crime (transparency and enforcement) act 2022 to make certain information, including personal data, publicly available. part 1 of this act sets out the registrars functions, powers and obligations in respect of roe, including many of the requirements for handling personal data. this includes how such data may be rectified and inaccuracies amended.
the uk gdpr is legislation that gives legal effect in the uk to gdpr, which, as a european regulation, previously had direct effect. this means that, unless otherwise stated in this charter, the provisions previously set out in gdpr still apply.
the data protection act 2018 provides for some domestic exemptions for the uk. paragraph 5 of schedule 2 part 1 of the data protection act 2018 provides the following exemption from specified uk gdpr provisions:
the listed gdpr provisions do not apply to personal data consisting of information that the controller is obliged by an enactment to make available to the public, to the extent that the application of those provisions would prevent the controller from complying with that obligation.
since the registrar is required by the companies act and economic crime (transparency and enforcement) act to make information available to the public, they’re entitled to rely on this exemption. therefore, they have an exemption from some elements of uk gdpr, including:
the requirement to provide ‘privacy notices’ to individuals
the requirement to provide personal data in response to subject access requests
the requirement to rectify personal data when it is inaccurate
the requirement to comply with requests to be ‘forgotten’
most of the principles of uk gdpr
this means it’s unlikely the registrar will be required, or able, to comply with any exercise of these uk gdpr rights in respect of personal data appearing on the public register or roe, except where the law allows it.
for example, the registrar will be unable to comply with any request for an individual to be ‘forgotten’ from the public register or roe where they have a legal obligation under the companies act to continue to make this personal data available.
if you have any queries or concerns about this, you can contact the dpo at dpo@companieshouse.gov.uk.
presenter’s details
if you file a paper form, you have the option to include certain contact details for the presenter of the form. if you include these presenter details, they’ll be placed onto the public record in the same way as all other information contained within the filing.
what we do with your data
before becoming an officer of a company or other entity or beneficial owner of an overseas entity, it’s important that you’re familiar with the legal implications. we are required by law to publish some of your personal data on the register or roe. these registers are publicly available and accessible by anyone.
commercial organisations may sometimes use data from these registers to create their own online products. these organisations then become controllers of your personal data. these organisations must establish how they comply with the data protection law as set out in uk gdpr.
if you have any concerns about company data on third party products and websites, you’ll need to contact the organisation directly. we’re not able to advise other organisations on uk gdpr compliance, and we cannot advise you on whether other organisations are complying with the law.
we may obtain information from third parties and public sources to verify your address or other personal details where this is appropriate, lawful and proportionate. such sources may include credit reference agencies or electoral rolls.
non-public data
some of your personal data will not be made available to the public. this includes the address you provide as your usual residential address and the day of your date of birth.
we must collect this information, but it will not be placed on the public register or roe - as long as you do not provide it when asked to give a service address.
we may share your personal data with:
other government departments and enforcement agencies
debt recovery agents and their appointed solicitors
legal counsel (in rare complex cases)
commercial printers (for instance when we need to print statutory notices)
sharing will only take place in certain circumstances, and only where permitted or required by law.
processing personal data obtained from third parties
we may obtain information about you from third parties where this is appropriate or necessary for lawful purposes. such purposes include:
where it is necessary to carry out our legal obligations
where it is substantially in the public interest and is necessary for:
performing our statutory functions, objectives and requirements
the prevention, detection and investigation of criminal offences or other unlawful acts
we may share this and other information with:
other government departments
enforcement authorities and agents
sharing will only take place in certain circumstances, and only where the law allows.
if you’re a director or person with significant control (psc) of a company, the companies act 2006 also allows the registrar to share information on your usual residential address and your full date of birth with credit reference agencies - unless you qualify for protection. this information is not placed onto the public register.
data processors
since the registrar is a controller for personal data appearing on the registers, the registrar is not acting as a data processor (as defined by uk gdpr) when maintaining a public register.
individuals, companies, agents and other representatives provide personal data for the public registers because they’re required to by law, and not for the registrar to process personal data on their behalf. because of this, the registrar does not have to provide a ‘statement of uk gdpr compliance’, or compliance with article 28 of the uk gdpr as a data processor.
in some cases, we employ third-party organisations as data processors to carry out elements of processing. for example, an external company to shred paper filings, which may contain personal data, or the use of third-party software solutions hosted in the cloud.
in all cases, contracts with these companies have been reviewed for uk gdpr compliance, and we’ve had assurance from all third-party processors of their own compliance.
the organisations we employ under contract as data processors are:
cloud services in the uk or eu/eea
uk based contact centre
uk based secure disposal
adjudicators for appeals of late filing penalties
uk based debt recovery
mail delivery and printing
overseas transfers
the register of companies and roe are freely accessible and available to the public, including overseas.
article 49(1)(g) of uk gdpr states that a transfer of personal data overseas can take place in the absence of specific safeguards where the transfer is made from a register intended to provide information to the public. this means we do not need to consider the adequacy of data protection regimes in all countries before making these public registers freely available online.
retention of personal data
companies house retains all records of companies as long as they’re active. records of dissolved companies are retained for 20 years, before they’re transferred to the public records office at the national archives (tna). this includes all information relating to company directors or its officers.
companies house has an agreement with tna to transfer a selection of our records 20 years after a company is dissolved. this agreement and the criteria for selection is set out in their operational selection policy.
tna will direct us to destroy any records that are not transferred.
you can apply to remove your residential address if it’s publicly available in records of live and dissolved companies.
following the government’s response to the corporate transparency and register reform consultation, we’ve stopped removing dissolved records from companies house service (chs) and added the records of all companies dissolved since january 2010.
previously, records of dissolved companies on chs were removed after 6 years (from the date of dissolution). these dissolved records are currently available for 20 years on other companies house products for a fee.
see searching the companies house register.

overview
under the equality act 2010, we have a legal duty to publish information that shows compliance with the public sector equality duty, and to publish our equality objectives.
equalities in policymaking and delivery
equality and diversity are critical to delivering dfe’s vision: we enable children and learners to thrive by protecting the vulnerable and ensuring the delivery of excellent standards of education, training and care. this helps realise everyone’s potential – and that powers our economy, strengthens society and increases fairness.
specific examples of our equality analysis
to deliver on our wider equality and diversity objectives, we invest in excellent analysis and research, some good-practice examples of which are provided here.

quality assurance framework
our social research aims to provide high-quality evidence to inform policy development and delivery.
research following children and young people of the 2020s
we’re running a new programme of research to understand the lives of children and young people growing up in the 2020s. the studies will provide vital insights into the wellbeing and education outcomes of children and young people in the key phases of education, from early years to post-16.
the following studies are being conducted on behalf of dfe and are underway.
children of the 2020s - ipsos is conducting the study between 2022 and 2027, following children’s learning and development from age 9 months to 5 years.
five to twelve - the national centre for social research (natcen) is conducting the study from 2023 until 2029, following children and their families from year 1 to year 6. if you have been contacted about participating in the study, send enquiries to fivetotwelve@natcen.ac.uk or freephone 0800 652 4568, monday to friday 9am to 5pm.
areas of research interest
dfe’s areas of research interest sets out the topics we would like to engage external researchers with. we expect to release further areas of research prompted by the challenges posed by coronavirus (covid-19) shortly.
dfe data for research
read our guidance on accessing dfe data extracts from the national pupil database (npd), school workforce, individualised learner record and higher education statistics agency.
research projects
routes to market for social and economic research
all new projects are being procured via 2 crown commercial service dynamic purchasing systems:
low value purchase system - provides public sector buyers with a new route to market for their below threshold common goods and services (under £120,000)
research and insights marketplace - enables central government and the wider public sector to commission social, market and economic research expertise and services
if you want to be invited to tender for research commissioned by dfe, you should register as a supplier on both systems.
registration is free and there is no limit to the number of suppliers who can join.
jaggaer: the dfe e-tendering portal
jaggaer is an e-tendering system used by dfe and its executive agencies. it is a password-protected online service.
as a potential supplier, you should register with jaggaer so that you can:
view opportunities to tender
submit tender responses
for help with registration, use the support links on the jaggaer portal.
publications
use the style guide and template to write your research publications.
you can find our research reports published since may 2010 in gov.uk’s publications section.
research published before may 2010 is available from the uk government web archive.
quality assurance framework
the framework sets out a standardised approach to quality assurance to ensure that analysis is:
fit for purpose
reliable
accurate
transparent
accountable
read the dfe quality assurance framework for analysis (pdf, 688 kb, 49 pages).

opening times:

find out about call charges: https://www.gov.uk/call-charges
how we treat your complaints
when we receive a complaint, we immediately refer it to an appropriate staff member who will then carry out an investigation.
we will reply in writing, or by telephone, within 15 working days from when we receive your complaint. if it is not possible for us to fully respond to you within this time, we will let you know and tell you what we are doing to deal with your complaint, when you can expect the full reply and from whom.
we will always acknowledge where things could have been done better and tell you what we will do to avoid the same thing happening again. equally, if we don’t agree with your complaint, we will let you know why.
what to do if you aren’t satisfied
the full reply to your complaint will include details of who to contact next if you think we have not dealt with it properly. this will normally be an appropriate senior departmental official.
that is the final stage of review for any complaint within dfe but, if you are still unhappy, you can refer your complaint to the parliamentary and health service ombudsman through your local mp.
our customer service standards
our ministerial and public communications division deals with most of our letters, emails, telephone enquiries and consultations.
we aim to:
respond to your letters and emails (including complaints) within 15 working days, or 20 days for freedom of information requests (in line with government standards)
answer at least 90% of calls within 30 seconds between 9.30am and 5pm on working weekdays
give you a response from the person best placed to answer your questions or provide the advice you need
be as polite, clear and helpful as possible
encourage you to give us feedback on our service so we can improve it
however we cannot respond to complainants who use obscenities, racist or homophobic language, or who are personally offensive about members of our staff.
questions we can’t help with
the procedure explained here is not for complaints about particular government policies. if you have a complaint about a policy, you can contact the minister for that policy, or alternatively contact your local mp.
complain about a school or an academy
if you need to complain about a school or an academy, you should first approach them direct and complete their complaints procedure. this should be published on their website. you can use the ‘get information about schools’ service to find the school’s website and view their complaints procedure.
find out who to complain to if you believe your complaint wasn’t handled correctly.
complaints advice for schools
all schools, including academies and free schools, must set up a complaints procedure.
further guidance for schools and guidance for academies is available.
complain about an early years provider
if you need to complain about an early years setting or childcare provider, you should approach them directly.
all early years settings (including childminders) must set up a complaints procedure.
contact ofsted if you feel your complaint was not resolved or if you think ofsted need to be made aware of it.
complain about local authority children’s services
if you need to complain about children’s social care or the child death review process within a local authority, you should approach the local authority directly.
all local authorities must set up a complaints procedure. contact your local authority directly to find out how to make a complaint.
contact your local ombudsman if you feel your complaint was not handled according to the local authority’s complaints procedure. you should also contact your local ombudsman if you wish to complain about the way your local authority handled a child death review.
complain about a higher education (he) provider
if you have a complaint about your he provider you should contact them directly.
your provider will have a complaints procedure you can follow and will send you a ‘completion of procedures’ letter at the end of the process.
contact the office of the independent adjudicator for higher education (oia) if your complaint cannot be resolved though the provider’s complaints process.
the oia can only support current or former he students.
the government:
cannot get involved in individual disputes between english universities and their students
does not review oia decisions
complain about a skills bootcamps course
learners and employers who want to complain about a course should contact their training providers. all skills bootcamp training providers must have a complaints procedure.
if you feel your complaint has been handled poorly, or the training provider has unduly delayed their response, you can complain about the handling of your complaint.
we will need the following information:
the name of the skills bootcamp course and training provider
the details of your complaint, including key dates
a copy of the original complaint sent to the training provider
if available, a copy of the letter or email from the training provider setting out the final response to your appeal
permission to disclose details of your complaint to the training provider
if you’re acting on behalf of a learner, evidence of their permission to do so
complain about an initial teacher training (itt) application
you can use the apply for teacher training page if you have a complaint about an itt application, including if you’ve been treated unfairly.
report a concern about a child or young person’s safety or welfare
if you are concerned about a child or young person, you should:
call 999 if you think the child or young person is in immediate danger
call the local police on 101 if you think a crime has been committed against the child or young person
contact your local council if you think a child or young person is at risk or is being abused or neglected
whistleblowing
if you work in an early years or educational setting, or a children’s social care service, and are concerned about suspected wrongdoing, you should follow the institution’s process for ‘blowing the whistle’.
if you are a professional with concerns about how child protection issues are being handled in your organisation, or another organisation, you should contact the national child abuse whistleblowing advice line on 0800 028 0285 or help@nspcc.org.uk.
all local-authority-maintained schools should set up a whistleblowing procedure.
report fraud
if you believe there is fraud or financial wrongdoing at an organisation we fund email full details, including the name of the organisation, to fraud.reports@education.gov.uk.
we will investigate cases where there is enough evidence.
during an investigation, we will try to keep your identity confidential, but we cannot guarantee it. in sufficiently serious cases, we may reveal your identity to the police or other authorities.

reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by nearly half (43%)
cutting the amount of waste we produce by 62%
using a third less water
this also means we’re making financial savings. we’ll keep improving our performance and aim to be even more efficient during 2015 to 2016.
the table below shows our performance for the 2014 to 2015 financial year, against a baseline for the 2009 to 2010 year. it compares our results to the cross-government performance.

code of practice
meeting summaries
the council for science and technology (cst) was reconstituted in 2011 with new terms of reference, a new membership and a new way of working.
ways of working
the council has 2 chairs. the government chief scientific adviser occupies 1 of the chairs. lord browne of madingley is the independent co-chair.
the cst work programme is developed by its members in discussion with the government. the government can ask cst to consider particular issues, but the council is under no obligation to agree to these requests if it believes that other work would be of greater value.
the council decides the approach to each area of work on a case-by-case basis. it can also provide advice to government as it thinks best, for example through meetings, letters or published reports.
further information on the cst can be found in cst ways of working and in government office for science annual report: 2017 to 2018.
code of practice
the cst adopts the government’s code of practice for scientific advisory committees although, as the cst’s role is to advise on strategic policy rather than to evaluate research, some parts of the code aren’t directly relevant to cst’s activities.
the code covers all of the committee’s work including role, remit, responsibilities of members, chairs and secretariats, working practices, and publication of documents. it ensures that the committee works openly and transparently.

the fco is the uk government department responsible for protecting and promoting british interests around the world, through the fco in london and our network of over 270 diplomatic posts in 168 countries and territories.
find out more about a career in the fco by visiting our pages on the civil service careers website.
we employ a diverse range of talented people capable of delivering to a high standard, often under pressure and sometimes in difficult places. we want the modern fco to reflect the very best of 21st century britain and encourage applications from all suitably qualified applicants irrespective of background or circumstances. our diversity and equality report 2016 includes data on the equality impact of the foreign office’s employment practices and activities.
in return, we guarantee a fascinating, personally rewarding career at the centre of world events. we regularly score highly in surveys of ‘employers graduates would most like to work for’. the civil service has been in the top 10 of the times top 100 graduate employers over the last decade and moved up to 2nd place in the times top 100 graduate employers 2017 to 2018.
our staff
the fco employs around 13,000 staff around the world. roughly a third is made up of uk-based british civil servants whose careers typically include work in the uk and postings overseas; and around two thirds are employed locally by our british diplomatic missions overseas (such as an embassy, high commission, or consulate). applicants for these roles should be based in that country and usually need to be able to work in the main local language. for information on our local staff vacancies, please visit the web page for the country you are interested in working in.
we aim to recruit a diverse workforce - talented people, capable of delivering to a high standard, often under pressure and sometimes in challenging environments. we also offer maternity, adoption or shared parental leave of up to 26 weeks full pay followed by 13 weeks of statutory pay and a further 13 weeks unpaid, and paternity leave of 2 weeks full pay. to learn more about our work, and what you could do, follow us on twitter, facebook or linkedin. to find jobs at the fco, visit the civil service jobs website.
recruitment
recruitment into the fco’s uk-based workforce is normally either as a generalist into the diplomatic or home civil service cadres where staff rotate between a variety of roles, including overseas, or as a specialist (taking up a specific role requiring specialist skills, such as research analysts, lawyers).
all appointments to the fco are made in strict accordance with the key recruitment principles of the civil service commission.
the civil service-wide recruitment freeze introduced in may 2010 limits new appointments to frontline and business-critical jobs only. this has generally restricted fco generalist recruitment permitted under the freeze to the diplomatic service fast stream. we also participate in a number of other fast stream schemes including:
government economic service fast stream
goverment communication service fast stream
digital data technology service fast stream
finance fast stream
commercial fast stream
human resources fast stream
apprenticeships
in contributing to the government’s goal of 3 million apprenticeships by 2020, the fco is committed to developing our apprenticeship programme. in 2018 to 2019, we have recruited apprentices in business administration, communications, human resources, finance (accountancy) and commercial procurement. we recruit apprentices via our own external recruitment and via the government communication service schemes.
current vacancies
all our vacancies are published on the civil service jobs website and can be found by using the ‘organisation’ search engine on the website. we encourage you to visit this site regularly and set up vacancy alerts so that you do not miss our opportunities.
work experience
the fco aims to recruit a talented and diverse workforce which reflects the society we serve. in order to generate interest in fco careers from a broader applicant base, we offer a range of work experience opportunities each year. we hope that by giving individuals from a range of backgrounds the opportunity to sample working at the fco they may consider the fco as a future employer, as well as gaining beneficial work experience.
undertaking work experience or internship with us does not in any way guarantee future employment with the fco or offer any preferential treatment in the selection processes. our recruitment for permanent employment is merit-based in strict accordance with the key recruitment principles of the civil service commission.
we regret that the graduate internship scheme has been cancelled for 2020, due to the unprecedented impact of coronavirus (covid-19) on our operations. we still expect to launch our 2021 scheme next year in the spring. details will be published on this page nearer the time.
alongside our own graduate internship, we offer placements under schemes run by other government departments such as:
civil service fast stream (for graduates)
summer diversity internship programme (for ethnic minority students, disabled students and those from under-represented socio-economic backgrounds)
the application windows for each of the government schemes vary, so you should check the relevant website for further details.
in order to ensure our opportunities are accessible to all those who are eligible, we do not offer any work experience opportunities to individuals on an ad-hoc basis. we do not have the resources to acknowledge or respond to speculative applications.
our work experience opportunities, which are paid, are mainly focused on attracting individuals from backgrounds that are currently under-represented in our workforce, and on those who bring skills which we require to achieve our objectives. all work experience placements are awarded strictly on merit, after a competitive application process.
you can also follow us on twitter, facebook, linked in or sign up to our rss feeds.
international secondments
the uk supports international efforts to prevent violent conflict, to resolve existing conflicts, and to build peace in post-conflict situations.
in support of this, the fco seconds civilian experts and police (serving and retired officers) to international missions run by the european union (eu), united nations (un) and organisation for security and cooperation in europe (osce).
find out more about international secondments with the fco, for serving and retired police, and civilian experts.

what we do
we are the uk’s tax, payments and customs authority, and we have a vital purpose: we collect the money that pays for the uk’s public services and help families and individuals with targeted financial support.
we do this by being impartial and increasingly effective and efficient in our administration. we help the honest majority to get their tax right and make it hard for the dishonest minority to cheat the system.
hmrc is a non-ministerial department, supported by 2 agencies and public bodies.

priorities
who we are
corporate information
responsibilities
we are responsible for:
working with the assay offices and trading standards to ensure that hallmarking law is enforced
creating regulations to help the assay offices (the official uk bodies who test the purity of precious metals) in their work and to help the uk jewellery trade grow
proposing legal changes and advising the secretary of state for business and trade
maintaining the high standards of the uk’s hallmarking facilities
monitoring the work of the uk assay offices and their established sub-offices (including any sub-offices offshore)
priorities
for 2022, our priorities are:
enterprise, promoting hallmarking as the guarantee of the integrity of the precious metals industry
improving the regulation of precious metals marketed online
encouraging risk-based and proportionate enforcement of hallmarking across trading standards
operational integrity
council members and chair, inductions, appraisals and recruitment
governance and administration, review in line with the framework document
read our corporate statement to find out how we are performing against our priorities.
who we are
the council
the assay offices appoint 6 members to the council:
2 from birmingham assay office
1 from edinburgh assay office
2 from london assay office
1 from sheffield assay office
see the membership page for details.
we may co-opt (elect people from outside the assay offices) up to 2 further members. such members are usually recommended by the edinburgh and sheffield assay offices. the assay masters (assay office chief executives) can’t be council members, but they have a right to attend and speak at meetings.
ten council members are appointed by the secretary of state. these members hold office for terms of 3 years.
we are funded entirely by the 4 uk assay offices who split the costs between them.
we normally meet twice a year where we receive a report from each assay office on its activities, and are supplied with statistical information which includes the number of articles assayed.
the assay offices
assay offices test the purity of precious metals, to protect consumers from buying fake items. if an item conforms with the legal requirements for purity, the assay office marks it with the appropriate hallmark. in the uk, a hallmark can only be applied by one of the 4 assay offices.
there are 4 assay offices in the uk:
birmingham assay office
edinburgh assay office
london assay office
sheffield assay office

overview
at natural england, science, evidence and analysis are at the heart of our advice, operations and regulatory activity.
to achieve our vision of thriving nature for people and planet, we need to understand:
what changes are occurring in the natural environment
what interventions and actions work well
our science, evidence and evaluation strategy sets out how we will achieve our ambition to be an evidence-led organisation. we work in partnership, across ecological, economic and social sciences to underpin our actions and decisions with robust data and evidence.
our science, evidence and analytical capability continues to grow. 79% of our staff are linked with one or more civil service professions. over a quarter of our staff have professional membership of one or more industry professional bodies.
our chief scientist, dr tim hill, takes the lead on this work.
our annual chief scientist report explains how we use evidence in nature’s recovery.
our natural england action plan also sets out our current priorities.
investing in science and evidence
natural england’s science and evidence portfolio oversees the evidence needs of the organisation. it delivers projects through a combination of in-house expertise, collaborative work with partners, grants and external contracts. examples include:
the natural capital ecosystem assessment programme
refining dna-based methods for monitoring, assessing and managing the environment - for example the application of edna techniques in mapping great crested newt populations
delivering nature-based solutions for climate change at the landscape scale programme
preparation of a state of natural capital report and embedding natural capital evidence in our work
read our publications in our access to evidence catalogue.
supporting strategic research and innovation
building partnerships for nature’s recovery is natural england’s mission. there are many ways to work in partnership with us, from informal arrangements to more formalised partnership agreements.
we also support a range of studentships and internships each year, working with a wide range of universities and research institutes. our national nature reserves research portal has information about suggested topics for dissertation projects based on our national nature reserves.
to look to the future, natural england utilises horizon scanning, systems thinking and innovation to consider emerging issues. we worked closely with the government office for science to shape the futures toolkit which we use in practice to direct our futures thinking.
using our evidence
high quality science, data and evidence underpin the advice we provide on the natural environment.
we continue to improve and develop new and existing projects. this means our best available evidence can be applied to decision making by investing in:
modernising and updating our digital and data systems
delivering environmental research, monitoring and analysis
evolving technologies including earth observation and data science techniques
evaluating our work
you can find out more about some of our environmental monitoring activities and how we apply new technologies on our natural england blog. this covers projects such as our people and nature survey (pans), and the creation of a national scale habitat map from satellite imagery and field observations.
you can use natural england’s data and derived evidence products or statistics in your work or study.
we have published our core principles and ways of working with data and evidence as a set of standards.
evaluating our work
we are committed to evaluating and learning from our projects, programmes, and delivery. we do this to understand what works for people and the natural environment, in line with formal government guidance set out in the magenta book. evaluation is a critical part of being an evidence-led organisation, in line with our science evidence and evaluation strategy.
we are keen to work with the wider sector to address the challenges of how we:
evaluate and learn from our projects and programmes
can innovate and build knowledge about what works for nature recovery

what is the voa?
the valuation office agency (voa) is an executive agency of hm revenue & customs. our valuation work covers every domestic and commercial property in england and wales, from your favourite restaurant to your local zoo. we undertake valuations for business rates, council tax, and for a range of public sector clients where we specialise in areas such as compulsory purchase, statutory valuations, asset valuations, and acquisition/disposal advice. we’re proud to have helped millions of people to pay the correct property taxes and receive the right financial support. our work is vital to the collection of over £50 billion of revenue which goes back into communities. we also help determine fair rents and housing allowance received.
who would i be working with?
we’re made up of more than 4000 civil servants who are based in over 30 locations throughout england, scotland and wales.
whilst most of our colleagues are surveyors belonging to the government property profession, we also have opportunities for all of the following professions:
analysis
commercial
communications
finance
hr

policy
programme and project management
we welcome colleagues from all backgrounds – you can read more about our commitments on diversity, inclusion and equality below.

is the voa right for you?
values and culture
as part of the civil service, everyone in the voa adheres to the civil service values of honesty, integrity, impartiality, and objectivity. this means that, for example, we do not have political affiliations and deliver the business of the government of the day without bias. we also want our colleagues to speak up safely when they feel it’s right to do so as part of our open and transparent culture.
alongside this, the voa culture is anchored in the value we have in each other. the annual civil service people survey gives us a chance to check in on how everyone in the agency feels about a range of topics. our 2022 results were positive in a challenging environment. most themes had similar scores to 2021 and remained at historically high levels. we achieved our highest participation rate with 82% of colleagues taking part. our engagement index matched the civil service benchmark at 65%. we also got an insight into the culture of our agency, with 86% of participants giving a positive view of inclusion in the agency – 5 percentage points higher than the civil service benchmark and 92% agree with the statement “i am treated with respect by the people i work with” – something we are proud about. we have also put a great emphasis on colleagues’ health & wellbeing, including ensuring they know where to go for their support.
diversity and equality
the voa is a level 3: disability confident leader. this means we have achieved the highest level possible in the disability confident campaign. to be a leader means doing the right thing, setting the right example, and sharing best practice.
the civil service embraces diversity and promotes equal opportunities. as such, we run a disability confident scheme (dcs) for candidates with disabilities who meet the minimum selection criteria.
we value and support all our colleagues. for example, we have strong and pro-active staff networks, and workplace adjustments put in place for those who need them.
we have been recognised as a top 75 employer on social mobility from the social mobility foundation index. in particular, helping colleagues from lower socio-economic backgrounds thrive in the workplace including bespoke mentoring schemes to help people fulfil their potential.
vetting and nationality rules
all our colleagues are security vetted to at least a baseline level. most of our work does not require a higher level, but the variety of work we do means that some colleagues are required to be security vetted to all types of national security vetting checks and clearances.
we can only welcome applications from people who have the right to live and work in the uk, and meet the civil service nationality rules.
how can i join the voa?

what do we do at voa?
we are the public sector’s property valuation experts and advisers – our work touches every citizen and every business across england and wales.
our work
you may not have heard of us, but the work we do is really important. not least because we’re helping to secure more than £50 billion of local government taxation to fund essential public services such as schools and hospitals.
we are the public sector’s property valuation experts and advisers; therefore, we are part of the uk civil service and one of the biggest employers of chartered surveyors in the uk. in simple terms our major task is to value millions of properties, both homes and business premises, so local councils know how much tax to charge.
you’re probably most familiar with the a-i council tax banding of your house. the valuation we determine ensures your house is in the right band, so you pay the correct amount of tax to your local council.
for businesses this is a bit more complicated. we value everything from your local shop to bigger supermarkets, sports stadiums to zoos, solar and wind farms, 4g transmission towers and everything in between.
a role for everyone
there’s a variety of job roles and job pathways in the voa. many people have progressed their careers in the voa, joining as young people and climbing the career ladder.
in the voa there are many varied and challenging roles and development programmes, including;
chartered surveyor
chartered surveyor and surveying technician apprenticeships
graduate valuation surveying programme
valuation surveyor placement programme/sandwich year
customer service advisor
property researcher
hr advisor
data and analysis roles
commercial and finance roles and many more.
we also offer internal apprenticeships in areas such as operational delivery and leadership and management.
voa work placement programme
at the voa, we regularly recruit real estate placement students across the uk, usually around october each year. our placement programme provides valuable experience and training which will help you begin your journey towards chartered valuation surveyor, and which will also support you in your final year at university.

25 days annual leave on entry, increasing to 30 days after 5 year’s qualifying service

flexible working, including flexi-time and hybrid working
equality, diversity and inclusion wellbeing initiatives
structured training
our placement programme is focussed on beginning the rics assessment of professional competence (apc) which you need to pass to become a chartered surveyor. our programme follows an rics accredited structured training plan of 12 months. during the programme you will receive thorough and targeted training from professional trainers and technical experts. you will have quarterly meetings with your rics counsellor to ensure you’re on track with your apc. you will also have additional help from other chartered surveyors to help and guide you. you will be working amongst some of the most experienced surveyors in the country in a very supportive environment.
we form part of the government property profession and civil service, therefore you would be able to take advantage of wider development opportunities. we also offer support for those unexpected moments with care leave and domestic emergencies.

at the voa, we regularly recruit graduate surveyors across the uk, usually around october each year. our graduate programme has an enviable reputation with assessment of professional competence (apc) success rates, which are amongst the best in the uk. many people we have supported through our graduate programme have quickly progressed into senior management or technical roles after their qualification.
your benefits
salary: over £26,000 per annum (£29,000 in london)
contract: flexible 37 hours per week
benefits: as a civil service employee, you’ll be entitled to a large range of benefits including:
25 days annual leave on entry, increasing to 30 days after 5 year’s qualifying service
a competitive contributory pension scheme
flexible working, including flexi-time
equality, diversity and inclusion wellbeing initiatives
structured training
our graduate programme is heavily focussed on the rics assessment of professional competence (apc) which you need to pass to become a chartered surveyor. our programme follows an rics accredited structured training plan of around 24 months, and usually involves rotations between business streams. during the programme you will receive thorough and targeted training from professional trainers and technical experts. you will have quarterly review meetings with your rics counsellor and supervisor to ensure you’re on track with your apc. you will also have additional help from other chartered surveyors to help and guide you. you will be working amongst some of the most experienced surveyors in the country in a very supportive environment. this support is reflected in our excellent apc pass rate.
we form part of the government property profession and civil service, therefore you would be able to take advantage of wider development opportunities. so not only do we support you towards achieving mrics status, we ensure you continue to develop your career into the long term.
essential requirements
a rics accredited pathway degree in real estate or valuation at 2:2 or above or msc in real estate
full uk / eu driving licence – a provisional licence is accepted at time of application however a full licence must be attained and evidenced within 6 months of starting the role. if you are considered disabled under the equality act 2010 and do not hold a full driving license, we will consider your application.
voa surveying apprenticeships
at the voa we run campaigns around february each year to recruit apprentices onto our level 3 surveying technician apprenticeship and level 6 chartered surveyor apprenticeship schemes. all our apprenticeships are advertised on the national apprenticeship website and on civil service jobs www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk
we also offer a range of other apprenticeships to existing colleagues too. so, if you join us in another role, you can apply for a range of apprenticeships as a development opportunity.
fantastic support
the surveying technician level 3 apprenticeship typically takes two years and three months to complete. it includes a level 3 diploma and qualification as an associate member of the royal institution of chartered surveyors (assocrics).
the chartered surveyor level 6 apprenticeship programme has two routes, bsc (around five years) and msc (around three years). most of our surveying apprenticeship roles focus on valuation but we also offer some opportunities in building and quantity surveying. you will gain relevant work experience in the chosen pathway as well as a royal institution of chartered surveyors (rics) accredited degree. during the last two years you will work towards your assessment of professional competence (apc) to become a chartered surveyor.
whichever programme you are on, you will be supported by a line manager, buddy and counsellor. they will help you build your network, your skills set and your career. you will be given 20% off-the-job time (paid time during your working hours) to learn, develop and study.
your benefits
salary: over £22,000 per annum (£26,000 in london) for level 3
salary: over £26,000 per annum (£29,000 in london) for level 6
contract: flexible 37 hours per week
benefits: as a civil service employee, you’ll be entitled to a large range of benefits including:
25 days annual leave on entry, increasing to 30 days after 5 year’s qualifying service
a competitive contributory pension scheme
flexible working, including flexi-time
equality, diversity and inclusion wellbeing initiatives
structured training to become rics qualified
an integrated programme of work and learning will be put in place to ensure you get the right mix and breadth of experience required to complete your apprenticeship.
for the level 3 apprenticeship an frics, mrics or assoc rics qualified colleague will act as your counsellor in year 2, supporting you to meet the professional requirements for the rics associate assessment. you will gain property research, inspection and valuation experience within either non-domestic rating, council tax or rent officer functions.
for the level 6 apprenticeship, part way through the programme you will begin recording against your apc, supported by an frics or mrics qualified colleague who will act as your counsellor. you will undertake a variety of roles including surveying and valuing properties for either council tax, non-domestic rating or district valuer services (the voa’s commercial arm). we will provide full training and mentoring.
essential requirements
academic entry requirements for level 3: gcse maths and english at grades 1-4 / a*-c or equivalent.
academic entry requirements for level 6 msc: an honours degree in a non-property related subject at 2:2 or above and gcse grade 1-4/a*-c or equivalent in maths and english.
academic entry requirements for level 6 bsc: 96 ucas points (2021 tariff), or an equivalent level of educational attainment, or assocrics. candidates must also hold gcse grade 1-4/a*-c or equivalent in maths and english.
driving licence requirements for level 6 bsc and msc: hold a full uk / eu driving licence – a provisional licence is accepted at time of application however a full licence must be attained and evidenced within 6 months (for msc) or 2 years (for bsc) of take up date. however, if you are considered disabled under the equality act 2010 and do not hold a full driving licence, we will consider your application.
driving licence requirements for level 3: typically, there are no driving licence requirements for level 3. however, this can vary depending operational requirements at the time of advertising.
general requirements for all our apprenticeships: certain residency requirements will apply. candidates must not already hold a qualification at the same level or above in the same subject area as the apprenticeship. for the duration of the apprenticeship, candidates can not undertake another qualification at the same time.

what we do
the adjudicator’s office investigates complaints about hm revenue and customs (hmrc) and the valuation office agency (voa). we review home office decisions on entitlement to compensation, under the windrush compensation scheme.
in addition we investigate complaints about how the home office handled a claim for compensation.
the adjudicator’s office will consider if the organisation has applied its rules, standards, guidance and codes of practice fairly and consistently. our decisions are based on the factual evidence of the complaint or review request.
the adjudicator’s office works with hm revenue & customs, the valuation office agency, and the home office.

copyright tribunal
the tribunal consists of a panel of 1 chairman and 2 deputy chairmen who are appointed by the lord chancellor. up to 8 ordinary lay members are appointed by the secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy.
the provisions covering the membership and constitution of the tribunal are set out in sections 145 to 148 of the 1988 copyright, designs and patents act.

his honour judge hacon, chairman
colleen keck, deputy chairman
andrew clay, deputy chairman

terms and conditions of appointment for ordinary members
fixed 5 year term which is non-renewable subject to earlier termination in accordance with the grounds for removal listed below.
removal
there are 6 grounds for removal from appointment:
misbehaviour
incapacity
bankruptcy
persistent failure to comply with sitting requirements (without good reason)
failure to comply with training requirements
sustained failure to observe the standards reasonably expected from a holder of such office
sitting days required
due to the nature of the workload of this tribunal, no guarantee will be given on the number of sitting days that will be offered to post-holders. however, the allocation of work is a judicial function and, subject to overriding operational requirements, all post-holders will be offered work on the same basis.
administrative support
the tribunal is administered by a secretary, who is a civil servant working in the intellectual property office. however, the secretary plays no part in the decision making process and the tribunal carries out its work and comes to its decisions completely independently of the office or any other part of government.
the secretary acts as a formal channel of communication for the tribunal and all correspondence should be addressed to the secretary.

our customer complaints procedure
how you can complain about the service you get from the marine management organisation (mmo).
about mmo complaints
we are committed to our customer charter and providing a professional service to everyone that we deal with. to enable this, we need you to tell us when we get things wrong.
we define complaints as any expression of dissatisfaction about the service provided to you. we will listen to your complaints, treat them seriously and where things go wrong learn from this so that we can continuously improve our service.
you can contact us about any aspect of the service you’ve received from us, including:
mistakes that have been made
unreasonable delays
how you’ve been treated
not being kept informed
we will not investigate complaints:
about government policy or law
that have already been investigated or are currently being investigated by the parliamentary and health service ombudsman
that are, or have been, subject to legal proceedings
how to make a complaint
if you’d like to complain about any aspect of the service you’ve received from us, let the office you have been dealing with know as soon as possible. we’ll do our best to put things right.
you can contact us by email or in writing. when you contact us, please tell us:
your full name and preferred method of contact
which area of the mmo you are complaining about
what happened, when it happened and how it affected you
what you want to happen to put things right
you can send an email to info@marinemanagement.org.uk or in writing to mmo complaints, lancaster house, hampshire court, newcastle upon tyne, ne4 7yh.
the three tiers of our complaints procedure
our complaint procedure contains three stages of escalation.
tier one
this is the first opportunity for mmo to resolve your complaint and most complaints can be resolved at this point. upon receipt, we will contact the relevant team and ask them to deal with your complaint.
where possible, we will attempt to resolve your concerns by phone and will follow up all conversations in writing.
tier two
if you are dissatisfied with the initial response you may request a review by an appropriate senior lead within the relevant team. please explain the full details of why you consider that your complaint has not been addressed at tier one, and we will carry out an investigation into your concerns.
tier three
if after tier two you are not satisfied you can ask any member of parliament to refer complaints about administrative actions by the mmo to the parliamentary ombudsman (also known as the parliamentary commissioner for administration).

if your complaint relates to a breach of environmental law, you can escalate your complaint to the office for environmental protection (oep).
the two most common ways in which a public authority could fail to comply with environmental law are:
failing to take proper account of environmental law when carrying out its activities, for example not carrying out an environmental impact assessment
unlawfully exercising, or failing to exercise, any activities it has to carry out under environmental law, for example not properly regulating environmentally harmful activities it is responsible for licensing

timescales for handling complaints
tier 1 - maximum 20 working days
acknowledgement within 5 working days
full response within 20 working days
tier 2 - maximum 20 working days
acknowledgement within 5 working days
full response within 20 working days
extending the time limits
we aim to complete all complaints within the timescales above; however, if a complaint is very complex it may occasionally be necessary to extend the time limit. if this is the case, we will keep you informed of progress with the investigation, the reasons for the delay, and the new deadline.
unreasonable customer contact
we aim to provide a professional service on every occasion to all our customers. our customer charter sets out our commitment to the level of service we will provide. in return, we expect our customers to behave appropriately and treat our employees with courtesy, consideration, and respect, to allow them to carry out their work.
we recognise that sometimes things can go wrong and might need to be put right. our complaint procedure covers how we handle complaints and where necessary, what actions we take to put things right.
there will also be a small number of cases where we consider a customer, either individually or as part of a group, might be behaving in ways that we consider are inappropriate and unreasonable, despite our efforts to help.
principles and aims
this policy provides clarity for our colleagues and customers what is expected of them, what they can do, who can authorise actions and how to respond to these situations.
it also enables us to deal with unreasonable customer behaviour consistently and professionally, outlining the steps we may take to deal with such behaviours.
what is considered unreasonable behaviour?
it is difficult to produce a comprehensive list of actions we consider to be unreasonable, and cases should always be considered on their own specific merits. however, we would generally categorise unreasonable and unacceptable behaviour under two main headings.
unreasonably persistent or vexatious contact
this consists of contact (written or verbal) which we consider places an unreasonable demand on our colleague’s time.
for example, customers who:
persist in pursuing a matter when they have already exhausted other statutory routes of appeal.
do not clearly identify the precise issues which they wish to be investigated, despite reasonable efforts to help them specify their concerns.
continue to seek to pursue an issue, including complaints, where the concerns identified are not within the remit of the mmo and this has been previously explained.
persist in pursuing a complaint where our complaints procedure has been fully and properly implemented and exhausted
change in the substance of a complaint or continually raise new issues or seek to prolong contact by continually raising further concerns or questions upon receipt of a response.
remain unwilling to accept documented evidence of action despite previous engagement.
remain unwilling to accept that the mmo has reached a final decision on a chosen course of action.
deny receiving an adequate response despite previously issued correspondence specifically answering their questions
focus on trivial matters to an extent which is out of proportion to its significance and continue to focus on this point.
have has an excessive number of contacts with the mmo placing unreasonable demands on our time and resources.
adopting a ‘scatter gun’ approach. this includes pursuing parallel complaints, or other contact, on the same issue with a variety of individuals and/or teams within the mmo.
aggressive or unacceptable behaviour
this consists of behaviour (written or verbal) that might intimidate, bully, harass or offend our employees.
for example:
secretly recording meetings and conversations without advance warning.
making malicious or unjustified allegations about mmo colleagues and/or using abusive, offensive or threatening language.
any comments relating to disability, religion, belief, perceived gender of other protected characteristic.
submitting falsified documents from themselves to assist any case against the mmo.
making threatening contact, either in person, via telephone or email.
any form of physical violence, including threats to carry this out.
any form of derogatory racial, ageist, homophobic and/or sexist remarks.
actions that may be taken
before any action is taken the customer will be provided with a warning and directed to a copy of this policy. this is to provide them with an opportunity to correct their behaviour.
if the unreasonable behaviour continues, action will be taken that is considered to be proportionate to the nature and frequency of the customers contact. this will be set out in writing to the customer and the reasons for any action will be clearly explained.
the following action may be taken, taking the specific behaviour and circumstances into account:
placing limits on the number and duration of contacts with colleagues per week or month.
only addressing correspondence sent by the customer in writing and to info@marinemanagement.org.uk
banning a customer from visiting any mmo office except by appointment.
letting a customer know that the mmo will no longer reply to or acknowledge any further contact from them on a specific topic.
where an ongoing service is being provided to the customer, limiting this to the legal minimum required only.
refusing to register and process any further contact from a customer altogether, including complaints.
taking legal action against a customer where appropriate.
appeal/review
all mmo customers have the right of review, and this will be set out in any decision letter.
request for a review must be made in writing, including by email, within two weeks of the date of notification of the decision made under the policy.
we will respond to all appeals within 20 working days of receipt of the request for a review.
when we will review existing decisions to apply policy
there will be a review of existing decisions to apply the policy every 12 months.
limits will be lifted, and relationships returned to normal, unless there are good grounds to extend them.
we will inform customer of the outcome of the review. if limits are to continue, we must explain the reasons and state when the limits will next be reviewed.
you can access a pdf copy of our unreasonable customer behaviour policy at this link: mmo unreasonable customer behaviour policy - march 2022 (pdf, 703 kb, 4 pages)
complaints against an mmo appointee to an inshore fisheries conservation authority (ifca)
complaints against an mmo appointee should be directed to the chair of the ifca (or mmo representative to the ifca if the complaint is about the chair).
in the first instance, the ifca will deal with any complaint. if the ifca chair decides that the appointee has broken their terms and conditions of appointment the ifca will contact the mmo, who will investigate, and if necessary, terminate the membership of the appointee.
if a complainant does not feel that the ifca has addressed their concerns satisfactorily, they should contact the mmo at ifcas@marinemanagement.org.uk.
any evidence to support the concerns raised should be included. the mmo will then investigate, and if necessary, terminate the membership of the appointee.
complaints against an ifca
we are not responsible for the overall conduct of ifcas. an ifca is a committee of a local authority, or a joint committee of several local authorities. ifcas also report against high level objectives set by the department for environment, food and rural affairs (defra).
complaints against the overall conduct of an ifca should be directed, in the following order, to:
the chair of the ifca
the sponsoring body in the relevant local authority
the local government ombudsman
the complainant should also inform the mmo of any complaint relating to structural or systematic issues with the ifcas, which the communications team will pass on to the ifca sponsorship team in defra.

as the government’s housing and regeneration agency we believe that affordable, quality homes in well-designed places are key to improving people’s lives. together with our partners, we’re accelerating the pace of house building and regeneration across the country, as we seek to deliver homes and places people are proud to live in – for generations to come.

we make this happen by using our powers, expertise, land, capital and influence to:
form partnerships that bridge the gap between the public and private sector, in order to deliver new homes and regenerate places that meet local needs and aspirations
champion the creation of sustainable homes, communities and places that are brilliantly designed for the people that live there now, and in the future
support the creation of a more resilient, diverse and innovative housing sector by helping new market entrants and smes (small and medium-sized enterprises) grow, encouraging greater use of modern methods of construction and by promoting the utmost attention to building safety
it’s an ambitious and exciting agenda that can only be achieved through collaboration and commitment. whether you’re a local authority, housebuilder, investor, developer – whatever your role in the built environment, we’re your partner in housing and regeneration, and we’re here to help.

how to get information
dhsc is committed to making transparency and accountability to the public a fundamental principle of how we do business.
the freedom of information act places a duty on public authorities to make as much information as possible available to the public. we do this by publishing the data that people need to understand who we are, what we spend and what we achieve.
under the act, we have to:
produce a publication scheme which contains information about the types of information we usually publish
make sure that information is published in accordance with the scheme
types of information we publish
we publish information about:
who we are and what we do
what we spend and how we spend it
what our priorities are and how we are doing
how we make decisions
our policies and procedures
lists and registers
services we offer
we don’t usually publish information that is:
not held by dhsc
exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act
in draft form
not easy to access (for example, it is in archive storage)
how to get information
we usually publish information on this website. if you can’t find the information you need on this site, you can make a freedom of information (foi) request.

about us
as the government’s housing and regeneration agency we believe that affordable, quality homes in well-designed places are key to improving people’s lives. together with our partners, we’re accelerating the pace of house building and regeneration across the country, as we seek to deliver homes and places people are proud to live in – for generations to come.
homes england
we make this happen by using our powers, expertise, land, capital and influence to:
form partnerships that bridge the gap between the public and private sector, in order to deliver new homes and regenerate places that meet local needs and aspirations
champion the creation of sustainable homes, communities and places that are brilliantly designed for the people that live there now, and in the future
support the creation of a more resilient, diverse and innovative housing sector by helping new market entrants and smes (small and medium-sized enterprises) grow, encouraging greater use of modern methods of construction and by promoting the utmost attention to building safety
it’s an ambitious and exciting agenda that can only be achieved through collaboration and commitment. whether you’re a local authority, housebuilder, investor, developer – whatever your role in the built environment, we’re your partner in housing and regeneration, and we’re here to help.
you can read about our mission and our strategic objectives in our strategic plan.

our corporate documents
corporate information
we are the regulator of medicines, medical devices and blood components for transfusion in the uk.
we put patients first in everything we do, right across the lifecycle of the products we regulate. we rigorously use science and data to inform our decisions, enable medical innovation and to make sure that medicines and healthcare products available in the uk are safe and effective.
our responsibilities are to:
ensure medicines, medical devices and blood components for transfusion meet applicable standards of safety, quality and efficacy (effectiveness)
secure safe supply chain for medicines, medical devices and blood components
promote international standardisation and harmonisation to assure the effectiveness and safety of biological medicines
educate the public and healthcare professionals about the risks and benefits of medicines, medical devices and blood components, leading to safer and more effective use
enable innovation and research and development that is beneficial to public health
collaborate with partners in the uk and internationally to support our mission to enable the earliest access to safe medicines and medical devices and to protect public health
what and how we regulate
we operate in a statutory framework set by hm government, working within government and the wider health system to direct overall policy in our regulatory field.
these policies establish our role in securing public health improvements and gives us the powers to deliver against our corporate responsibilities.
medicines and vaccines
medical devices
blood components
e-cigarettes
traditional herbal and homeopathic remedies
we constantly strive for improvement in our field, and when we identify changes that will improve people’s access to safe, quality healthcare products, our recommendations are agreed by the secretary of state.
our corporate governance
we are governed by a unitary board of directors with an equal number of executive and non-executive directors, and a non-executive chairperson, supported by three board assurance committees.
the board is responsible for advising on the strategic direction of the agency, ensuring that targets set out in the business plan and agreed with ministers, are met.
the board is not involved in any regulatory decisions affecting medicines or medical devices. these are the responsibility of the chief executive and executive committee (senior leadership team). however, the board members must make declarations of interests to ensure their independence.
our independent advisory bodies
advisory board on the registration of homeopathic products: the advisory board advises on the safety and quality of homeopathic medicines when there’s an application for registration, marketing authorisation or licence of right.
blood consultative committee: the blood consultative committee works with the national executive blood bodies and other stakeholders to develop advice and recommendations on regulatory aspects of blood banks, blood establishments and blood processes.
british pharmacopoeia: the bp makes an important contribution to the role of the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (mhra) in protecting public health by providing quality standards for uk pharmaceutical substances and medicinal products.
clinical practice research datalink (cprd) research data governance (rdg) process: independent scientific and patient advice on research-related requests to access cprd data via the non-statutory independent scientific advisory committee was established in 2006, and superseded in june 2021 by the rdg process comprising expert review committees (ercs) and the central advisory committee (cac).
commission on human medicines: the commission on human medicines (chm) advises ministers on the safety, efficacy and quality of medicinal products.
devices expert advisory committee: the devices expert advisory committee (deac) replaces the committee on safety of devices and is responsible for providing independent, external expert input and advice on a wide range of aspects relating to medical devices to help the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (mhra) in the execution of its role in ensuring the safe introduction and management of medical devices.
herbal medicines advisory committee: the herbal medicines advisory committee advises on the safety and quality of herbal medicines when there’s an application for registration, marketing authorisation or product licence.
the review panel: the review panel (mhra) carries out statutory and non-statutory reviews of proposals, decisions and provisional decisions taken by medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency.

guidance on how to complain

contact the independent case examiner
1. before you make a complaint
you can make a complaint if you’re unhappy with the service provided by dwp, for example if:
mistakes have been made
there were unreasonable delays
you feel you’ve been treated poorly
you haven’t been kept informed
a complaint is defined as any expression of dissatisfaction about the service provided which is not resolved by operational staff as normal business.
we will not investigate complaints:
about government policy or law
that have already been investigated or are currently being investigated by the independent case examiner or the parliamentary and health service ombudsman
that are, or have been, subject to legal proceedings, including legal settlements
challenge or appeal a benefit decision
you cannot make a complaint to challenge a benefit decision (this is known as a ‘mandatory reconsideration’) or appeal against a benefit decision, overpayment decision, child maintenance assessment or sanction.
read about how to request a mandatory reconsideration of a benefits decision.
if you disagree with the decision in a mandatory reconsideration notice, you can appeal to the social security and child support tribunal.
state pension age changes
at present, we are not investigating complaints about 1950s women and state pension age changes.
we stopped investigating these complaints on 30 november 2018 when the issue went before the high court. both the high court and the court of appeal have given judgment on this matter, in favour of the government. the supreme court refused permission to appeal but the claimants have 6 months from the date of that decision to appeal to the european court of human rights.
in the meantime, the parliamentary and health service ombudsman began an investigation. dwp will not investigate a matter that is being considered by the ombudsman.
if you have already complained to us, we will write again to inform you of the next steps.
we will continue to investigate complaints not related to state pension age changes under the normal dwp complaints procedure.
2. contact the office you’ve been dealing with
if you’d like to complain about any aspect of the service you’ve received, let the office you have been dealing with know as soon as possible.
you can contact them by phone, in person or in writing. universal credit claimants can also use their journal.
you need to let them know:
your national insurance number – unless you are an employer
your full name, address and contact numbers
which benefit you are complaining about
what happened, when it happened and how it affected you
what you want to happen to put things right
if we’ve made a mistake, we’ll put it right as soon as possible and apologise immediately. if you’ve experienced unfair treatment or suffered financially, we may consider making a special payment to you.
who to contact
use the contact details at the top of any recent letters we’ve sent you or the contact details below.
if you live in northern ireland, go to the department for communities website for more information.
to complain about an organisation that provides dwp services, for example employment programmes or health assessment providers, contact them directly. if you don’t agree with their response, they will tell you how to take things further.

all staff are entitled to up to 10 months’ paid sick leave (5 months at full pay and 5 months at half pay). staff also have access to occupational health advisers who are able to provide a confidential advice service on health concerns in the workplace.
we value our employees’ health so we also operate an employee assistance programme providing support and advice. the help employee assistance programme (help eap) offers you confidential, independent and unbiased information and guidance on a range of emotional, health and social subject areas; support is for both work related and personal matters. support is available 24 hours, 365 day a year.

we are the uk’s tax, payments and customs authority, and we have a vital purpose: we collect the money that pays for the uk’s public services and help families and individuals with targeted financial support.
we do this by being impartial and increasingly effective and efficient in our administration. we help the honest majority to get their tax right and make it hard for the dishonest minority to cheat the system.
hmrc is a non-ministerial department, supported by 2 agencies and public bodies.

quality assurance framework
our social research aims to provide high-quality evidence to inform policy development and delivery.
research following children and young people of the 2020s
we’re running a new programme of research to understand the lives of children and young people growing up in the 2020s. the studies will provide vital insights into the wellbeing and education outcomes of children and young people in the key phases of education, from early years to post-16.
the following studies are being conducted on behalf of dfe and are underway.
children of the 2020s - ipsos is conducting the study between 2022 and 2027, following children’s learning and development from age 9 months to 5 years.
five to twelve - the national centre for social research (natcen) is conducting the study from 2023 until 2029, following children and their families from year 1 to year 6. if you have been contacted about participating in the study, send enquiries to fivetotwelve@natcen.ac.uk or freephone 0800 652 4568, monday to friday 9am to 5pm.
areas of research interest
dfe’s areas of research interest sets out the topics we would like to engage external researchers with. we expect to release further areas of research prompted by the challenges posed by coronavirus (covid-19) shortly.
dfe data for research
read our guidance on accessing dfe data extracts from the national pupil database (npd), school workforce, individualised learner record and higher education statistics agency.
research projects
routes to market for social and economic research
all new projects are being procured via 2 crown commercial service dynamic purchasing systems:
low value purchase system - provides public sector buyers with a new route to market for their below threshold common goods and services (under £120,000)
research and insights marketplace - enables central government and the wider public sector to commission social, market and economic research expertise and services
if you want to be invited to tender for research commissioned by dfe, you should register as a supplier on both systems.
registration is free and there is no limit to the number of suppliers who can join.
jaggaer: the dfe e-tendering portal
jaggaer is an e-tendering system used by dfe and its executive agencies. it is a password-protected online service.
as a potential supplier, you should register with jaggaer so that you can:
view opportunities to tender
submit tender responses
for help with registration, use the support links on the jaggaer portal.
publications
use the style guide and template to write your research publications.
you can find our research reports published since may 2010 in gov.uk’s publications section.
research published before may 2010 is available from the uk government web archive.
quality assurance framework
the framework sets out a standardised approach to quality assurance to ensure that analysis is:
fit for purpose
reliable
accurate
transparent
accountable

business impact target (bit) and the independent verification body (ivb) for the 2017 to 2022 parliament
transparency data
corporate information
bringing an external perspective on how regulatory proposals can impact businesses and civil society organisations. we do this by appraising critically the evidence and analysis presented in impact assessments, which support regulatory policy decisions.
our views are made available both to ministers making decisions and subsequently to parliament when scrutinising proposed legislation.
the regulatory policy committee (rpc):
provides an independent view on better regulation and how to promote this across government, ensuring due consideration is given to limiting the unnecessary burden of regulation on businesses and civil society organisations; while supporting the development of appropriate, evidence-led regulation
with government to improve the quality of evidence and analysis to support regulatory policy development and, where necessary, states independently where the principles of better regulation are threatened
presents transparently the regulatory costs to business and civil society organisations likely to arise from government regulatory policies and, where required, questions where impacts are not captured by regulatory exemptions
who we are
the rpc is an independent body, sponsored by the department for business and trade (dbt).
the committee is formed of independent experts from a range of backgrounds, including the private and voluntary sectors, business, the legal profession, and academia. collectively, the rpc has experience and knowledge of employee, consumer and economic issues. our committee members are:
stephen gibson
jonathan cave
hilary jennings
stephen gifford
daniel dalton
john longworth
andrew williams-fry
members of the committee are appointed after an open competition, which follows the ministerial governance code on public appointments. the committee is supported by a secretariat of civil servants formed of economists, policy advisers and operational researchers.
what we do
we assess the quality of evidence and analysis used to inform regulatory proposals affecting the economy, businesses, civil society, charities and other non-government organisations. our independent advice and scrutiny helps ensure that ministerial policy decisions are based on accurate evidence, and helps to produce better regulation. where we assess the impact of regulatory proposals, we provide advice in the form of opinions, which help to convey whether:
central government departments’ estimated costs or savings to business, as a result of regulatory reforms, are accurate and can be validated. the accuracy of these estimates is important as they help to inform decisions on whether or not proposals are taken forward
government departments have explained why new regulation is more appropriate than non-regulatory, or voluntary, options. a clear principle of the government’s better regulation framework is not to presume that regulation is the answer, and to consider a range of meaningful alternative options, we help to ensure that proposals consider these points
government has, where appropriate, minimised the regulatory burdens on small and micro businesses, in particular
independent scrutiny
the key to our success is independent scrutiny, which means we provide:
strong challenge to policy makers
a counter to any bias towards regulation, and to optimism bias in assessments
an external view of regulatory impacts
as a result of our scrutiny:
the government produces better regulatory outcomes for society
businesses and non-government organisations are less likely to be burdened by regulation that is not supported by robust evidence
there has been a drive for cultural change – both on the use of evidence and on reducing regulation
the estimated costs and benefits of regulatory proposals are more accurate
the accuracy of the government’s regulatory account is more reliable than would be the case without independent scrutiny
the government’s regulatory framework has enhanced credibility
there is increased transparency around evidence and government’s use of it
rpc blog
our blog is an opportunity for us to share our independent views on better regulation principles and regulatory reform proposals, to inform and stimulate policy debate and discussion.
we welcome and encourage comments and views on the issues we raise in our posts. this is a real opportunity for interested parties to share their ideas and views on live issues to help shape the future regulatory landscape.
our posts should not be interpreted as government policy, intent, or news.
external stakeholder engagement
we actively engage with business groups, sectoral associations and representatives of wider civil society to understand the impact of regulations from their perspective. if stakeholders are concerned about the impact of a particular regulation or legislation, then we welcome any evidence of that impact to assist us in our scrutiny, particularly on published impact assessments.
we work directly with government departments and regulators. information or views from stakeholders on new regulatory and deregulatory proposals should be submitted to the department responsible for developing the policy during their consultation. however, if you have additional information, including your consultation response, that you think the committee should be considering when deciding if an impact assessment is fit for purpose, please get in touch.
how you can engage with us
follow us on twitter and feel free to make use of the direct message facility.
visit our website where you can find our latest news, published opinions, and blogs by our chair/committee members.
email us via regulatoryenquiries@rpc.gov.uk if you have any questions.
how we collaborate with european and international partners
the rpc has been conducting extensive international engagement since its creation in 2009. we promote best practice and share in-depth technical knowledge on regulatory scrutiny to enhance bilateral and multilateral regulatory compatibility. our international outreach develops and strengthens the rpc’s reputation as a centre of excellence and contributes to the global britain vision and the uk’s perception as a key bilateral partner.
we exchange best practice with similar and like-minded organisations, which scrutinise impacts from regulatory changes in their own country. we work with colleagues from germany, the netherlands, sweden, finland, norway and the czech republic in the regwatcheurope network. our work with this group extends to regulatory scrutiny bodies in other european countries including iceland, slovakia, portugal, denmark, italy, estonia and lithuania, to establish their own regulatory scrutiny bodies and to enhance their methodology.
we also work with the oecd regulatory policy committee, the oecd’s global expert forum for the enhancement of domestic and transnational better regulation policies. alongside making substantial contributions to improving regulatory scrutiny and better regulation, we also lead on engagement with the oecd rpc on behalf of regwatcheurope.
in addition, we engage bilaterally with key trading and capacity building partners, to exchange knowledge and best practice overseas. most recently, this has included south korea, hong kong, moldova and iceland. we have also engaged with our partners from the seychelles, australia, chile, france and china in our london offices.
rpc guidance and training
the rpc also regularly produces and updates guidance for departments and regulators. our guidance helps to support the formation of better regulation and is supplementary to our training offers. please get in contact with us if you would like to find out about our tailored impact assessment training for policy teams.
what we don’t do
as our work is impartial, we do not comment or offer opinions on policies themselves; these are matters for the government.
we do not review impact assessments for proposals that are not in the scope of the better regulation framework. we do not scrutinise impact assessments (ias) that relate to tax or spending decisions. we scrutinise ias that relate to the regulation or deregulation of business or civil society organisations, and we do not review ias for proposals that regulate only individuals or public bodies.
regulatory policy committee opinions
regulatory proposals are accompanied by impact assessments, which assess and estimate the likely associated risks, costs and benefits of regulatory proposals that have an impact on business, charities or voluntary organisations, the public sector or individuals. a well-written ia should: explain clearly the issue the government are trying to tackle; how they intend to tackle it; and what the effects of proposals will be.
for proposals that regulate or deregulate business or civil society organisations, the rpc scrutinises ias, and provides to ministers opinions on the quality of analysis and evidence presented. these opinions inform the decisions of ministers as to whether or not to proceed with proposals.
see rpc’s opinions.
the opinion-writing process and opinion ratings
once an ia is submitted by a government department for rpc scrutiny, the rpc operates an established, rigorous and consistent multi-stage assessment process. this is undertake in line with guidance published by government in the better regulation framework manual.
for final stage impact assessments:
initial review notice (irn)
red-rating
green-rating
the ia, as first submitted to the rpc, is not fit for purpose. if major concerns over the quality of evidence and analysis are not addressed after an irn has been issued to a department, this could result in a formal red rating. irns contain informal advice and are, therefore, not published. the ia is not fit for purpose following the department’s response to an irn. the rpc retains major concerns over the quality of the evidence and analysis, and the overall quality of the ia, that need to be addressed. red-rated opinions are formal and are published once the corresponding ia has been published. the ia is fit for purpose. the rpc has no significant concerns or where some minor issues could be improved. there may be many points for improvement, which the department should consider. green-rated opinions are formal and are published when the corresponding ia has been published.
for equivalent annual net direct cost to business (eandcb) validation ia:
validated
not validated
the eandcb figure in the ia is validated. there are no significant concerns over the quality of the evidence and analysis. there is sufficient analysis to suggest that the eandcb is accurate to within £100,000. the eandcb figure in the ia is not validated. there are significant concerns over the quality of the evidence and analysis; calculations or data may be missing or not verifiable. there is insufficient analysis and/or the rpc believes that the eandcb figure is inaccurate.
for consultation stage ias we offer to provide informal advice, which is not published. if an ia is not fit for purpose at the consultation stage, we provide advice on: what must be addressed at the consultation stage; what must be addressed at the final stage; and what should be improved. consultation stage ias may also follow the formal route, as for final stage ias above.
the rpc used to issue amber-ratings however these have since been replaced by just green or red opinions.
find published copies of rpc opinions.
publishing of opinions
the rpc produces its opinions to help departments ensure the evidence and analysis in their impact assessments (ias) is sufficiently robust. we provide an independent opinion to assist both final ministerial decision-making and parliamentary scrutiny of regulatory legislation. we publish these when it is appropriate to do so, both to assist parliamentarians and so that the process is transparent to external stakeholders.
the rpc therefore seeks to issue its opinions to departments in good time to support the first of these objectives – ministerial decision making – and for the same reason we encourage departments to submit ias to us so that we are in a position to do so. we have a standard 30-day turnaround target for cases but always endeavour to process cases more rapidly where it can assist in delivery of the aims above.
in order to meet the second and third objectives – provide independent opinion to parliamentarians and transparency to stakeholders – the rpc publishes its opinions at the most appropriate point once the policy proposals considered in the ia are in the public domain. in routine cases, the opinion will be published at the same time as the ia is put in the public domain, commonly on introduction of the measure to parliament.
the rpc always works with departments to liaise over publication whilst maintaining its ability to consider independent publication where appropriate in line with the objectives above. we do not publish where doing so might expose policy under development that has not been announced by government. but in general, we consider the publication of the legislation as announcing the policy and the rpc does not consider itself constrained by the publication or not of the associated ia. therefore, in cases where publication of the ia is delayed, the rpc reserves the right to publish its opinions when it considers it can assist parliamentary scrutiny.
history
the rpc was established in 2009. it was the first body in the uk set up to provide independent scrutiny of proposed regulatory measures, put forward by government. in 2012, the rpc became an independent advisory non‐departmental public body (ndpb) - defined as a body that has a role in the processes of national government, but is not a government department or part of one, and which accordingly operates to a greater or lesser extent at arm’s length from ministers.
business impact target (bit) and the independent verification body (ivb) for the 2017 to 2022 parliament
the small business, enterprise and employment act 2015 requires the government of the day to do the following within the first year of a new parliament:
publish a business impact target (bit) for the duration of the parliament (and an interim bit for the first 3 years).
publish details of regulation that does, and does not, count towards the bit during the parliament (that is in scope of the target).
publish a metric for calculating the economic impact on business of measures in scope of the bit.
appoint an ivb to verify the economic impact on business of measures in scope of the bit.
the appointment of the ivb was awarded to the regulatory policy committee for the 2017 to 2022 parliament.
de minimis 2018
in 2018 the de minimis threshold of a £5 million positive or negative impact on business was introduced.
usually, if the direct impacts on business of either primary legislation, and/or the exercise of secondary powers arising from it, are greater than ±£5 million eandcb, then the legislation is subject to the better regulation framework and the related ias should be submitted to the rpc for independent scrutiny.
if the direct impact on business of the primary legislation and related secondary legislation is below the de minimis threshold, or falls under the safer building exclusion, then a proportionate ia is required.
it is for departments to establish an appropriate process to record decisions on whether a measure is below the de minimis threshold. such measures may be subject to ‘call in’ to confirm that the de minimis threshold has been appropriately applied. for more information and clarity please see the better regulation executive (bre) better regulation framework: guidance.
transparency data
rpc meeting minutes
the rpc holds regular meetings where the committee assembles to discuss: better regulation policy updates; methodology; forthcoming regulation; stakeholder engagement; guidance we have produced; and our own performance.
see our meeting minutes.
register of interests
we ensure that, where there are conflicts of interests between committee members and the subject of regulatory proposals, committee members are excluded from seeing these papers. this helps our independent scrutiny remain impartial and unbiased. to keep track of any conflicts of interest we update our register of interests regularly.
our policy on gifts and hospitality
we comply with general dbt guidance for gifts and hospitality. all gifts, hospitality and other services whether offered, accepted or rejected need to be registered within 3 days of being been offered.
we keep our gifts and hospitality register updated regularly.

what we do
we are the uk’s tax, payments and customs authority, and we have a vital purpose: we collect the money that pays for the uk’s public services and help families and individuals with targeted financial support.
we do this by being impartial and increasingly effective and efficient in our administration. we help the honest majority to get their tax right and make it hard for the dishonest minority to cheat the system.
hmrc is a non-ministerial department, supported by 2 agencies and public bodies.

about us
the independent committee on standards in public life advises the prime minister on arrangements for upholding ethical standards of conduct across public life in england. we are not a regulator and cannot investigate individual complaints.
committee on standards in public life
the committee advises the prime minister on ethical standards across public life. it conducts broad inquiries, collecting evidence to assess institutions, policies and practices and makes recommendations to the prime minister where appropriate.
the committee promotes the principles of public life, which outline the ethical standards those working in the public sector are expected to adhere to. the principles apply to all public office holders and private and voluntary organisations delivering services paid for by public funds.
the committee has no remit to comment on or investigate individual cases.
under its remit, the committee cannot inquire into matters relating to devolved legislatures and governments except with their agreement. when the subject of the committee’s reviews impact on reserved areas however, the committee seeks the views of the devolved administrations as appropriate.

all staff are entitled to up to 10 months’ paid sick leave (5 months at full pay and 5 months at half pay). staff also have access to occupational health advisers who are able to provide a confidential advice service on health concerns in the workplace.
we value our employees’ health so we also operate an employee assistance programme providing support and advice. the help employee assistance programme (help eap) offers you confidential, independent and unbiased information and guidance on a range of emotional, health and social subject areas; support is for both work related and personal matters. support is available 24 hours, 365 day a year.

we do this by being impartial and increasingly effective and efficient in our administration. we help the honest majority to get their tax right and make it hard for the dishonest minority to cheat the system.

government internal fraud initiative
from monday 30 october 2017, dfid will be participating in the government internal fraud initiative in conjunction with the cabinet office. the purpose of the initiative is to protect the civil service and public funds against loss caused by internal fraud and dishonest conduct, and introduce a strong deterrent against it.
under the initiative, a 5 year ban preventing individuals gaining employment in any participating department will be imposed on anyone dismissed for fraudulent or dishonest conduct. individuals who resign or otherwise leave, but would have been dismissed had they continued in employment will also be subject to the ban.
successful interview candidates to dfid will be screened against the cabinet office database. the cabinet office will use information on the outcome of any checks for monitoring and analysis purposes, and to ensure that checks are being carried out correctly. the data will also be used for research on the prevention and detection of fraud. no data will be shared outside of the department for international development, cabinet office, civil service resourcing, and other participating departments except on an anonymised basis.
alumni association
over time dfid has benefitted from an exceptionally talented and diverse group of employees. dfid’s alumni network maintains connections between current employees and alumni and improves access to organisational knowledge and experience. if you have worked for dfid, the overseas development administration (oda) or the overseas development ministry (odm), the alumni association is for you. it’s your first port of call for getting the latest news from fellow alumni, and updates about the work of the department.

these services are now provided by fcdo: - international development funding opportunities - uk-funded development projects around the world

organogram
summary organogram
where we work
we work in countries across africa, asia and the middle east, many of which are fragile or at risk from fragile neighbours. we also have regional programmes in africa, asia and the caribbean, and development relationships with 3 aid dependent overseas territories – st helena, the pitcairn islands and montserrat. in addition to working directly in countries, dfid also gives uk aid through multi-country global programmes and core contributions to multilaterals.
international development acts
three acts of parliament have helped to put development higher on the national agenda. the international development act 2002 provides the main legal basis for the provision of development assistance – assistance for the purpose of sustainable development or welfare, and likely to contribute to poverty reduction – and humanitarian assistance; the international development (reporting and transparency) act 2006 defines dfid’s reporting to parliament through its annual report; and the international development (official development assistance target) act 2015 enshrines into legislation the commitment to spend 0.7% of national income on aid.
case studies
our case studies explore the impact of dfid’s work and provide real-life examples of our policies in practice.
funding
we fund many organisations that are working to end poverty. find out about how our funding schemes work and how to apply.
reporting fraud or corrupt practices
there are scam messages being sent to the public relating to covid-19 by sms (text). please take note that the uk government will only ask you to go to the gov.uk/coronavirus website. anything else should be treated as a scam. if you receive a suspicious text, please forward it to 7726.
the internal audit department’s internal audit investigations section is the central point for raising concerns, suspicions and/or allegations of fraud, sexual exploitation and abuse or other corrupt practices. this includes both internal and external cases where dfid funds, assets or interests (including dfid’s reputation) are involved, as well as any breach of the civil service code.
iad’s internal audit investigations section has a dedicated secure email address for raising all concerns: reportingconcerns@dfid.gov.uk
alternatively, any concerns can be reported by:
calling the confidential hotline on +44 (0)1355 843747
writing to the head of internal audit, 22 whitehall, london, sw1a 2eg, united kingdom

national fraud initiative 2016/17
the use of dfid data to prevent or detect fraud.
dfid is participating in the national fraud initiative (nfi) 2016/17 data matching exercise carried out by the cabinet office. we are required by law to protect public funds that we administer and our participation in the nfi will assist in the prevention and detection of fraud.
we are participating on a voluntary basis and will provide the cabinet office with details of our trade creditors as set out in the cabinet office’s guidance.
this form of data matching involves comparing computer records held by one public body against those held by other public bodies to establish if there are any corresponding records. computerised data matching allows potentially fraudulent claims and payments to be identified. where an inconsistency is found it may indicate that further investigation is necessary.
the use of data by the cabinet office in a data matching exercise is carried out with statutory authority under its powers in part 2a of the audit commission act, 1998. it does not require the consent of the individuals concerned under the data protection act, 1998.
data matching by the cabinet office is subject to a code of practice.
further information on the cabinet office’s legal powers and reasons why it matches particular information.
our guide to how we manage our programmes (smart rules) and administration (blue book)
the smart rules provide the operating framework for the department for international development’s (dfid’s) programmes.
the blue book (admin only) has been revised and now covers all non-programme elements of dfid’s operating framework (ie human resources, security and estates).
corporate communications
the uk aid logo is designed to help publicly acknowledge that the development programmes we and our partners deliver are funded by uk taxpayers.
staff in dfid and our partner governments and organisations can download the artwork for the uk aid logo and instructions on how and when to use it.
all organisations delivering dfid-funded programmes must use the uk aid logo in accordance with our standards for use.

what we do
the new research for development (r4d) is now live research for development outputs
research is at the heart of dfid’s thinking. high quality research which generates strong and applicable evidence helps us build good development programmes. research can open up new possibilities and empower us to deal with difficult problems. outputs from dfid funded research projects and programmes are available on research for development outputs.
dfid has an open and enhanced access policy to help make the research we fund freely available and to increase the uptake and use of it. dfid’s research uptake guidance and accompanying checklist provide information on dfid’s approach to research uptake and advice for designing a research uptake strategy.
dfid research has 3 strands of work:
to develop new technologies and products such as drought resistant crops, better drugs for malaria and neglected diseases
to help us understand what development approaches work most effectively in order to improve the impact and value for money of spending on development
to improve our understanding of key development questions so that we make the best policy choices. for example, predicting the onset of the west african rains, finding out why girls leave school early and understanding causes and effects of corruption and how to address them.

upcoming statistical releases
the release timetable
dfid makes every effort to release its national statistics as soon as possible and in an orderly manner in line with the code of practice for statistics. we publish official statistics on provisional and final uk aid spending normally in spring and autumn in statistics on international development. we also release figures for gross public expenditure on international development after sid.
the timing of these releases is largely determined by the timetable for reporting uk oda figures to the oecd, when the office for national statistics make the latest gni estimates available, and the timing for processing and quality assuring the spending data from dfid, other government departments and other oda contributors.

our commitment
natural england is committed to contributing to the achievement of a strong, healthy and just society. we promote personal well-being, social cohesion and inclusion, and creating equal opportunity for people in existing and future communities.
what we are doing
natural england’s equality and diversity policies and procedures comply with the law and any duties required of public sector organisations. we ensure they are practiced in ways which foster an inclusive work and service environment where each person feels respected, valued and understood, whatever their diversity.
we use equality impact assessments (eqias) as a tool to ensure that equality, social inclusion and community cohesion issues are considered when drawing up policies or proposals which affect the delivery of services, development of policies or the running of projects. eqias help to measure whether policies will have a negative, neutral, or positive effect on different communities, and to identify potential improvements to services. for an example see recruitment selection (pdf, 168 kb, 5 pages).
equality and diversity data

accommodation for those who serve
the ministry of defence (mod) is a central government department with a mission to protect our country and provide the ultimate guarantee of its security and independence, as well as helping to protect its values and interests abroad.
to do this we must meet a complex range of threats and challenges in a rapidly changing world. we must adapt to stay ahead and shape our capability to address tomorrow’s threats, not yesterday’s. we will build more versatile and agile forces for the future, and ensure our people have what they need to do what we ask of them. we cannot do everything on our own, so we must work effectively with our allies and partners.
we offer a range of careers both in the armed forces, reserves and civilians so however you want to contribute to our mission, either through serving in the british army, royal navy, royal air force or as a civil servant, there will be something to suit you.
join the armed forces

join the civil service
at the ministry of defence we offer engaging jobs in work that really matters; jobs which have a direct impact on the quality of services we provide. roles can offer great job satisfaction and there are many opportunities to develop and progress both within mod and across the wider civil service. certain posts, notably those concerned with security and intelligence, might be reserved for british citizens, but this will not normally prevent access to a wide range of developmental opportunities across a very wide number of professions.
we employ people in so many different roles and in many locations across the uk and abroad. we have jobs in policy, finance, hr, it commercial and project management and all the types of jobs you would expect to find in a government department. we also employ doctors, dentists, teachers, police, fire service, quantity surveyors, engineers to name a few. we have many opportunities to become an apprentice in the ministry of defence. so think of any type of job and you may find it in the mod.
we value diversity and are committed to being an equal opportunities employer. we aim to develop all our staff to enable them to make a full contribution to meeting mod objectives, and to fulfil their own potential on merit. we offer flexible working patterns to enable our employees to balance home and work responsibilities; and we treat people fairly irrespective of their working arrangements.
the ministry of defence is committed to attracting and retaining people from across the full range of backgrounds and enabling flexible ways of working as the norm. we offer maternity, adoption or shared parental leave of up to 26 weeks full pay followed by 13 weeks of statutory pay and a further 13 weeks unpaid, and paternity leave of 2 weeks full pay.

apprenticeships
mod is the largest provider of apprenticeships in the uk. find out about apprenticeships for civil servants and the armed forces.
apprenticeships in the ministry of defence guard service
a wide range of apprenticeships are available to new and existing mgs staff, making them a great option for anyone looking to enhance their knowledge and skills in their current role or to support career progression. apprenticeships are available in many professional areas, including operational delivery, customer service and leadership and management.
the mgs recognise the value of learning in enabling sustainable delivery of its business objectives and have invested in a full time apprenticeship coordinator to provide help and support to the apprentice and line manager.
school leavers and welbeck college
school leavers
whether involved in combat, peacekeeping duties or the provision of humanitarian aid following natural disasters, the armed forces depend on the support and expertise provided by our civilian staff. we would like this to be you.
the mod offers many varied opportunities for school leavers throughout the uk where you can make a real difference to defence. the number of different careers are too many to list in full, but they include personal secretary, pay clerk, commercial officer, project and admin support, finance clerk, commodity manager, course administrator and recruitment and marketing, along with many others.
all these roles are absolutely vital to our mission in defence, giving a unique vision and access to some of the most interesting work in government. perhaps you could be a commercial officer buying vehicles for the army. perhaps you could be a personal secretary to a senior civil servant who decides the latest defence policy. perhaps you could be a commodity manager routeing supplies to a recent disaster area.
but we don’t just focus on your current job, we place an enormous emphasis on your future. every single person in the organisation is given comprehensive training and development, including the opportunity to develop cross disciplines.
as the mod is so large it is entirely possible to change career direction, perhaps even study for professional qualifications, while retaining your status and similar conditions of employment, including your pension and leave allowance. examples would be engineers moving into personnel or accountancy, and administrators becoming graphic designers or logicians.
this is in addition to a number of management development schemes aimed at the full spectrum of the mod workforce, designed to help you fulfil your true potential.
welbeck: the defence sixth form college
welbeck college in leicestershire is an mod sponsored sixth form college that invests in the future of young people who have a strong desire to take up a science or engineering based career in the armed forces or the civil service.
welbeck has provided the army with many of its future technical officers for over 50 years. in 2004 the college became a quad-service institution, admitting students with a career ambition to join the royal navy, the british army, the royal air force or to become mod civil service engineers.
the college has become one of the uk’s top sixth form colleges and has an outstanding academic reputation. it offers a unique programme of personal, physical and intellectual development which provides our students with a rounded education specifically designed to meet the needs of today’s modern technical armed forces.
the programme does not end after a 2 year a-level programme, the mod continues to monitor and support students through university and on to professional training with their respective armed service or within the mod civil service.
graduate recruitment programmes
fast stream
our premiere development scheme for graduates is fast stream, although many graduates also enter through applying for vacancies on civil service jobs.
defence commercial graduate programme
the defence commercial graduate programme recruits graduates for mod purchasing and contract management roles. full details available in the commercial graduate brochure.
desg
the mod also recruits engineering and science graduates into desg via various schemes.
security vetting
we process 3 main types of national security vetting (nsv) checks and clearances.
counter terrorist check (ctc) for people employed in posts with proximity to public figures, access to information or material assessed to be of value to terrorists or unescorted access to establishments assessed to be at risk from terrorist attack. a ctc does not allow a person access to or knowledge of protectively marked assets.
security check (sc) for people employed in posts which have substantial access to secret assets or occasional controlled access to top secret assets.
developed vetting (dv) is needed for people with substantial unsupervised access to top secret assets.
a small number of clearances are granted where the risks are managed through follow up work and monitoring. we call this activity ‘aftercare’. we also process aftercare for all mod clearances that are granted normally.
see united kingdom security vetting: forms and guidance.
diversity and inclusion
the ministry of defence is committed to recruiting and retaining the best possible people from across the country, regardless of background, gender, ethnicity, working pattern, caring responsibilities, sexual orientation or, for civil servants, whether they are disabled.
this is not only morally the right thing to do, but is fundamental to the operational effectiveness of defence.
we are striving to be an employer of choice through recognising, encouraging and celebrating diversity, and ensuring everyone in defence plays their part in promoting an inclusive working environment and respecting and valuing the unique contribution of each individual.
our work to become a more diverse and inclusive organisation is being driven by the defence diversity and inclusion programme which was established in 2013 and covers both civilian and military employees.
as a part of this programme we are working to meet the government’s aspiration for 10% of new recruits into the armed forces to be from bame communities by 2020. additionally we are striving to meet a target of 15% of new recruits into the armed forces to be female by 2020.
while recruitment is an important element of our work, the wider defence diversity and inclusion programme takes a much broader view of diversity and inclusion and is driving real change by embedding diversity and inclusion within our leadership and culture and taking steps to increase the retention and progression of people from under represented groups. this all encompassing approach to diversity and inclusion is essential if the department is to retain the high quality people that we recruit.

all candidates will be treated respectfully, equitably and honestly irrespective of race, ethnic origin, religion or belief, gender, sexual orientation or social background. the armed forces recognise and value individuals from diverse backgrounds who bring with them fresh ideas, knowledge, experience and talent.
family friendly policies in the armed forces
the armed forces offer occupational leave schemes which follow, and in some cases, exceed statutory provision for maternity, paternity and adoption leave.
armed forces occupational maternity scheme
all servicewomen regardless of their length of service are entitled to 52 weeks of maternity leave. eligible servicewomen are also entitled to receive statutory maternity pay. the armed forces occupational maternity scheme (afoms) provides qualifying women (those who have at least a year’s continuous service and who intend to return to work for a minimum of 12 months following maternity leave) with full pay for the first 26 weeks of ordinary maternity leave.
servicewomen who have given birth are screened from deployment in the uk or overseas for at least 6 months after the birth of their child, unless they volunteer otherwise. the services also endeavour not to deploy both serving parents at the same time, where this does not compromise operational capability.
the armed forces occupational paternity leave scheme provides qualifying fathers with 14 days of ordinary paternity leave, instead of the statutory provision of 10 days, with 2 weeks’ full pay rather than the statutory paternity pay rate at the time of the birth of a child or a child’s placement in the case of adoptions. additional paternity leave was introduced for members of the armed forces in 2011 and this enables parents to share responsibility for looking after their children in the case of births and placements for adoption.
the armed forces are exempt from the flexible working provisions of uk employment legislation, as working patterns that might compromise the operational flexibility of the armed forces are incompatible with regular service. arrangements are in place to improve, where possible, the work-life balance of both male and female personnel. these include:
transfer of leave between spouses and civil partners: this allows a service person to donate or receive up to 10 days of annual leave to their civil partner or spouse. this can be useful if one partner has used up much of their leave, or if a partner has more leave than they can carry over into the next year.
call forward of leave: this allows a service person to bring 10 days of leave from the next leave year, and use them in the current leave year. this can be helpful if the service person is aware that they will deploy in the next leave year, and will find themselves unable to use all of that year’s leave entitlement, due to operational commitments.
enhanced leave: this allows service personnel who have served in the armed forces for 15 years or more a once in career opportunity to take 10 weeks (50 working days) off work in a block, by trading in their 30 days leave allowance for that year. this gives personnel the opportunity to take up once in a lifetime opportunities, have that extension built, or simply take a period of much deserved down time.
flexible working: this has always existed within the armed forces, but are being more widely encouraged. there are 3 types of flexible working:
compressed hours: allows service personnel to potentially work slightly longer some days of the week in order to take a shorter day.
working from home: allows service personnel to use existing it to work from home on either a regular or infrequent basis.
variable start and finish times: allows a service person to start and finish at different times during the working week.
further schemes and services available for armed forces personnel and their families, including support through the armed forces covenant on education, employment, housing, finance and accommodation, are available here.
accommodation for those who serve
being a regular member of the armed forces infers a commitment to move, or be moved, to locations around the uk and overseas. we understand the impact this can have on service personnel and particularly their families and children who may travel with them. with this in mind, we have made it a condition of service to ensure personnel are provided with high quality subsided accommodation whilst they are serving.
the accommodation is a fundamental part of the overall package for service personnel and, depending on individual circumstances, can take the form of either publicly provided family or single accommodation either at their duty station or very nearby to it. mod has targets to ensure the accommodation provided is of good quality, suitably located and affordable; indeed, when compared to renting similar property types in the private sector, charges payable for mod provided accommodation are considerably lower.
in addition to providing services accommodation, the mod also operates the forces help to buy scheme. the scheme offers military personnel an interest free advance of up to 50% of their gross annual salary (capped at £25,000) to assist them buying their first home or, in particular circumstances, extending their existing home or moving property within the uk or republic of ireland. the advance is repaid directly from salary over 10 years.
more broadly, and in recognition of those personnel wanting to own their own home when they leave the military, the government has given personnel priority for government funded shared ownership schemes including the popular help to buy equity scheme. further details about these and other affordable housing schemes can be found at forces help to buy: help to get on the property ladder.

if you’re still not happy after that, check that we can handle your complaint.
for help and support with making formal complaints to schools, colleges, training providers or employers, contact the citizens advice bureau, or search their online help pages.
check we can handle your complaint

a copy of the final, response to your appeal, that you received from them
permission to disclose details of your complaint, to the organisation concerned

fcdo guidance, services and information
these services are now provided by fcdo: - international development funding opportunities - uk-funded development projects around the world
history of dfid
dfid was a ministerial department from may 1997 to september 2020. it merged with the foreign and commonwealth office to create fcdo.
what is uk aid?
responsibilities
we are responsible for:
honouring the uk’s international commitments and taking action to achieve the united nations’ global goals
making british aid more effective by improving transparency, openness and value for money
targeting british international development policy on economic growth and wealth creation
improving the coherence and performance of british international development policy in fragile and conflict-affected countries
improving the lives of girls and women through better education and a greater choice on family planning
preventing violence against girls and women in the developing world
helping to prevent climate change and encouraging adaptation and low-carbon growth in developing countries
priorities
strengthening global peace, security and governance
strengthening resilience and response to crisis
promoting global prosperity
tackling extreme poverty and helping the world’s most vulnerable
delivering value for money
read our single departmental plan to find out more about how we are performing against our objectives.
who we are
the department for international development (dfid) was set up in 1997. we employ around 3,600 staff who work in our offices in london, east kilbride and globally.
organogram
summary organogram
where we work
we work in countries across africa, asia and the middle east, many of which are fragile or at risk from fragile neighbours. we also have regional programmes in africa, asia and the caribbean, and development relationships with 3 aid dependent overseas territories – st helena, the pitcairn islands and montserrat. in addition to working directly in countries, dfid also gives uk aid through multi-country global programmes and core contributions to multilaterals.
international development acts
three acts of parliament have helped to put development higher on the national agenda. the international development act 2002 provides the main legal basis for the provision of development assistance – assistance for the purpose of sustainable development or welfare, and likely to contribute to poverty reduction – and humanitarian assistance; the international development (reporting and transparency) act 2006 defines dfid’s reporting to parliament through its annual report; and the international development (official development assistance target) act 2015 enshrines into legislation the commitment to spend 0.7% of national income on aid.
case studies
our case studies explore the impact of dfid’s work and provide real-life examples of our policies in practice.
funding
we fund many organisations that are working to end poverty. find out about how our funding schemes work and how to apply.
reporting fraud or corrupt practices
there are scam messages being sent to the public relating to covid-19 by sms (text). please take note that the uk government will only ask you to go to the gov.uk/coronavirus website. anything else should be treated as a scam. if you receive a suspicious text, please forward it to 7726.
the internal audit department’s internal audit investigations section is the central point for raising concerns, suspicions and/or allegations of fraud, sexual exploitation and abuse or other corrupt practices. this includes both internal and external cases where dfid funds, assets or interests (including dfid’s reputation) are involved, as well as any breach of the civil service code.
iad’s internal audit investigations section has a dedicated secure email address for raising all concerns: reportingconcerns@dfid.gov.uk
alternatively, any concerns can be reported by:
calling the confidential hotline on +44 (0)1355 843747
writing to the head of internal audit, 22 whitehall, london, sw1a 2eg, united kingdom
fraud statistics:
fraud statistics for the period 2019 to 2020 (pdf, 131 kb, 2 pages)
fraud statistics for the period 2018 to 2019 (pdf, 138 kb, 1 page)
fraud statistics for the period 2017 to 2018 (pdf, 377 kb, 1 page)
your information will be treated in confidence. you do not have to provide personal details, however such information will assist us in taking forward your concerns and enable us to provide you with a response on the outcome. if you ask us not to disclose your identity we will not do so without your consent, unless required by law.
if you are concerned about confidentiality you may wish to contact public concern at work, an independent charity, which provides free legal advice on reporting of concerns.
contact details 020 7404 6609 / helpline@pcaw.co.uk
national fraud initiative 2016/17
the use of dfid data to prevent or detect fraud.
dfid is participating in the national fraud initiative (nfi) 2016/17 data matching exercise carried out by the cabinet office. we are required by law to protect public funds that we administer and our participation in the nfi will assist in the prevention and detection of fraud.
we are participating on a voluntary basis and will provide the cabinet office with details of our trade creditors as set out in the cabinet office’s guidance.
this form of data matching involves comparing computer records held by one public body against those held by other public bodies to establish if there are any corresponding records. computerised data matching allows potentially fraudulent claims and payments to be identified. where an inconsistency is found it may indicate that further investigation is necessary.
the use of data by the cabinet office in a data matching exercise is carried out with statutory authority under its powers in part 2a of the audit commission act, 1998. it does not require the consent of the individuals concerned under the data protection act, 1998.
data matching by the cabinet office is subject to a code of practice.
further information on the cabinet office’s legal powers and reasons why it matches particular information.
our guide to how we manage our programmes (smart rules) and administration (blue book)
the smart rules provide the operating framework for the department for international development’s (dfid’s) programmes.
the blue book (admin only) has been revised and now covers all non-programme elements of dfid’s operating framework (ie human resources, security and estates).
corporate communications
the uk aid logo is designed to help publicly acknowledge that the development programmes we and our partners deliver are funded by uk taxpayers.
staff in dfid and our partner governments and organisations can download the artwork for the uk aid logo and instructions on how and when to use it.
all organisations delivering dfid-funded programmes must use the uk aid logo in accordance with our standards for use.
no other organisation is permitted to use the logo without our permission.
contact dfid

we make this happen by using our powers, expertise, land, capital and influence to:
form partnerships that bridge the gap between the public and private sector, in order to deliver new homes and regenerate places that meet local needs and aspirations
champion the creation of sustainable homes, communities and places that are brilliantly designed for the people that live there now, and in the future
support the creation of a more resilient, diverse and innovative housing sector by helping new market entrants and smes (small and medium-sized enterprises) grow, encouraging greater use of modern methods of construction and by promoting the utmost attention to building safety
it’s an ambitious and exciting agenda that can only be achieved through collaboration and commitment. whether you’re a local authority, housebuilder, investor, developer – whatever your role in the built environment, we’re your partner in housing and regeneration, and we’re here to help.

hm land registry safeguards land and property ownership valued at £8 trillion, enabling over £1 trillion worth of personal and commercial lending to be secured against property across england and wales. the land register contains more than 26 million titles showing evidence of ownership for more than 88% of the land mass of england and wales.
anyone buying or selling land or property, or taking out a mortgage, must apply to us to register:
unregistered land or property
any new owner of registered land or property
an interest affecting registered land or property, such as a mortgage, a lease or a right of way
when considering each application, we use the law to decide whether and how it should be registered.
register land or property with us
once land or property is entered in the register, we record any ownership changes, mortgages or leases that affect it. anyone who suffers loss because of an error or omission in the register, or because the register needs to be corrected, will normally be compensated.
we are committed to carrying out our statutory and commercial business with fairness, openness and honesty. we have policies and procedures to prevent bribery.

our personal information charter contains the standards you can expect when we ask for, or hold, your personal information. it also covers what we ask of you, to help us keep information up to date.
the treasury solicitor’s bona vacantia division
we collect information for the purposes of dealing with the collection and disposal of dissolved company assets and the administration of the estates of persons who die intestate and without known kin. the information we collect about you depends on the reason for your business with us, but we may use the information for any of these purposes. we may also use information about you to carry out research about how effective our services are.
the information we have about you
the information we keep can include:
forms you have completed and given to us
claims you have made over the phone
letters you have sent to us
copies of identification documents forwarded
details of any checks we make to ensure information we have is right
computer records to do with your business with the department
information we get from or give to other organisations
as well as checking the information provided with any information we already have, we may get information about you from other people and other organisations, as the law allows. we may also give information to certain other organisations. this can be because:
the law (including the data protection act) allows us to, or says we have to
a court order says it is necessary
you have given your permission
the organisations we may give information to, or receive it from, include other government departments and their agencies, in particular companies house, land registry, probate office, general register offices, her majesty’s revenue and customs (hmrc), local authorities, hospitals and health authorities, banks, building societies and other financial bodies, law enforcement agencies including the police, the serious organised crime agency and the assets recovery agency. we give information to, or receive it from, such organisations to:

sharing information with the police and other law enforcement agencies
the bona vacantia division may provide your personal information to police forces and other law enforcement bodies, to assist in the prevention and detection of crime and the apprehension and prosecution of offenders. information will only be disclosed where it can be shown that not doing so would prejudice these purposes.
data protection act 1998
the data protection act (dpa) sets rules for the way organisations treat personal information about you. it applies to paper and computer records. the dpa allows you to find out what information is held about you on computer and in some paper records.
request to see the personal information we hold
if you want to see the information we have about you, please tell us exactly what information you want to see. this will help us to provide you with a better service. we will send you a copy of the information we have, if any, as soon as possible and at the latest within 40 calendar days. you must ask for the information in writing and give us information that allows us to be sure of your identity and address. for example, tell us your:
full name
address
date of birth
if you have any other reference numbers we use, such as a case reference number, or any other information you think might help us to identify you, please also include this.
exceptions
normally you can see all the information we have, but there are some exceptions, mainly to do with the way fraud is detected, legal professional privilege , or prevented or catching and prosecuting offenders.
contact us
please address your request to:
data protection officer
treasury solicitor’s department

what we do
‘bona vacantia’ means vacant goods and is the name given to ownerless property, which by law passes to the crown.
the treasury solicitor acts for the crown to administer the estates of people who die intestate (without a will) and without known kin (entitled blood relatives) and collect the assets of dissolved companies and other various ownerless goods in england and wales.
bvd is part of the government legal department.

our purpose
defra, in partnership with its arms’ length bodies, publish a broad range of statistics and data on the environment, food, farming and biosecurity and marine. we see our statistics as a valuable public asset. through them we seek to provide a window on the world across the areas covered by defra’s policy and delivery remits and to inform the judgements and decisions made by the public, by organisations and by government.
our portfolio
defra group publish regular and ad hoc statistics which provide accurate and impartial information across four main themes. browse our main portfolios:
environment
food, farming and biosecurity
marine
rural
our latest and upcoming publications
in current circumstances, the release dates of forthcoming defra group statistics publications may need to change, for example where data capture has been impacted by covid-19 restrictions. our aim is to flag any changes to planned publication dates as soon as we can. any decisions to change publications dates will be made in line with guidance from the office for statistics regulation.
for queries about specific planned release dates, please contact the relevant mailboxes.
a separate calendar of release dates across the group for the year ahead, providing a split by month, is available defra statistics release calendar, annual and monthly (ods, 36.9 kb).
our standards
we publish our national and official statistics guided by the uk statistics authority’s code of practice for statistics.
many of these are national statistics, identified by the round ‘tick’ logo with the words, ‘national statistics’, which are subject to assessment by the uk statistics authority. reports of all assessments are published on the authority’s website.
how we meet the standards of the code
the arrangements we have in place to ensure we comply with the code are set out in the documents below:
defra policy statement on revisions and corrections
defra group statistics quality statement
defra group breaches of the code of practice for official statistics
pre-release access to official statistics
we publish details of how we comply with the pre-release access to official statistics order 2008 and a list of the roles of those currently granted pre-release access to our key official statistics.
defra group pre-release access to official statistics compliance statement
list of statistics with pre-release access (ods, 11.7 kb)
developing our portfolios
defra and defra group more broadly has a wide portfolio of statistics and our commitment is to the continued development of that portfolio. informed by the code of practice for statistics, much of our focus is on understanding of external user needs. we are building a range of approaches for this – including direct engagement (e.g. via the @defrastats twitter account) and through enhanced web analytics. we will continue to evolve in response to feedback by looking at accessibility of formats and continue to look for opportunities to increase value. looking further forward, we will continue to assess the opportunities provided by new technologies such as e-dna and earth observation.
within each of our areas of interest, we will look to find the best long term balance between:
overall portfolio summary products such as the compendium of food and farming statistics.
continued production of regular individual official statistical releases on specific topics.
production of simpler more data focused releases (where user insight tells us that the external interest is in the numbers rather than the commentary).
where we see the potential value of new official statistics products or developing existing products, we will look to use the mechanisms in the code of practice for statistics. specifically, we may introduce new experimental statistics, where we decide to develop a new output or modify an existing one. experimental statistics are by definition official statistics and are within the scope of the code of practice. during development, we seek feedback from users on their suitability and quality.
another option open to us is to use the recently introduced voluntary application of the code of practice approach.
across defra group, the following experimental statistics are in development:

research integrity
quality assurance
research and analysis provides evidence for decision-making, ensuring defra’s polices are based on a sound, comprehensive understanding of current evidence. it helps us find new policy solutions and identify and tackle future issues.
we use the term ‘evidence’ to encompass material from a variety of disciplines – science research, statistics, economics, social research or operational research, and geographical information. we use a variety of quality assurance processes.
science advisory council
defra’s science advisory council provides independent advice and challenge to defra’s chief scientific adviser and ministers on the science underpinning defra policies.
science research and analysis
to inform sound policy-making, defra needs access to the right information and needs to be confident of the quality of that information. understanding the knowledge base and using targeted investment to fill critical gaps will help achieve value for money and innovative approaches.
our refreshed defra group research and innovation interests document sets out our high level areas of science, evidence and analysis interest across the defra group.
information about individual projects is available in our science and research projects database
commissioning research and analysis projects
research and analysis projects are commissioned through a competitive process and advertised on our e-tendering site. you can express your interest by registering for an account and logging in.
research project reporting
contractors should use the following forms when reporting to defra on projects:
annual/interim project report form (evid3) - to report on progress in delivering research projects
evidence project final report form (evid4) - to report on final project results and outputs
open access policy for publications
our defra group open access policy for research publications aims to increase access to, sharing and use of findings arising from research funded by the defra group.
statistics
across defra group, our statisticians produce a wide range of official and national statistics providing insight for external users and for policy-makers on state and on change across our environmental, food and farming, rural and marine portfolios. the products are developed in accordance with the principles and guidelines set out in the uk statistics authority’s code of practice for official statistics.
economics
defra economists provide analysis, appraisal and evaluation for all aspects of defra policy, to ensure policy decisions are informed by high quality and robust evidence in order to meet defra’s strategic objectives.
social research
good social science research helps make good government strategy, policy and delivery. social science research informs the development, implementation and evaluation of a wide range of government policies. the best results are often the result of teamwork, with government social research profession members, other analysts and policy or delivery officials working together throughout the development and implementation of an idea to ensure it is as evidence based as possible. engagement as early as possible in this process helps ensure the results of any analytical work are as useful as possible.
operational research
operational research is all about helping people to understand complex problems, achieving the best outcomes and making the best use of public money. it provides flexible techniques that can be applied to a variety of problems, from discussions and logical problem structuring through to analysing statistics and building predictive models. it is especially useful to conduct ‘what if’ analyses, to help policy-makers evaluate different policy options.
geospatial data
geospatial data is any data that is referenced to a specific location, such as a postcode, field parcel or grid reference. types of data include imagery, features, basemaps and tabular data with links to specific locations.
defra makes extensive use of geospatial data to support the development, monitoring and delivery of its policies, as well as underpinning the communication of the impact of those policies to a wide variety of audiences. defra is one of the leading users of geospatial data in government and has been at the forefront of a number of innovative developments using geographic information systems (gis).
defra is the lead department for the implementation of the inspire regulations. if you would like to know more, email geography@defra.gov.uk
defra group has a large number of members of the government geography profession.
research integrity
defra has signed up to the principles of the concordat to support research integrity, which provides a national framework for good research conduct and its governance.
defra publishes an annual compliance statement summarising the processes and measures in place to support research integrity across defra group. this includes the governance, culture, guidance, training, external engagement, and open science principles that underpin the research that is conducted in defra.
quality assurance
defra makes a substantial investment in commissioning, assessing and using evidence to inform policy and it is important to ensure that evidence is fit for purpose.
peer review
defra uses peer review of selected evidence proposals and outputs to help ensure the evidence it funds is good quality and fit-for-purpose.
the joint code of practice for research
the joint code of practice for research (jcopr) sets out standards for the quality of science and the quality of research processes that contractors who carry out research on behalf of defra, and other signatory organisations, must follow.
the joint code of practice for veterinary activities
the joint code of practice for veterinary activities sets out standards for the quality of evidence processes, to help assure the quality of veterinary data across animal health activities.
social research
the government social research (gsr) code sets out 7 principles to guide the work and behaviour of the government social research profession.
