The success has been so great that insurgents have largely lost control of the area and now rely on IEDs [improvised explosive devices] as their primary method of attack,” he said.




And in the east, forces had he said:




…significantly disrupted the Haqqani Network through Operations SHAMSHIR and KNIFE EDGE, where coalition forces captured or eliminated over 500 insurgent leaders and fighters last fall.




The Haqqani Network has been blamed for a series of high-profile attacks in Kabul, including one on the US Embassy in September last year.


The network is based in the Afghan-Pakistan border region, which Brigadier General Jacobson said would remain a key focus for operations.


Kabul itself had, he said:




…become a thriving commercial capital, able to absorb and respond to spectacular attempts to disrupt security with resolute response to insurgent attacks, leaving the insurgents largely in a state of failure.




Brigadier General Jacobson said Afghan forces were clearly in control of the city, as part of a phased transition ahead of a pull-out of NATO combat troops in 2014.


His remarks came in stark contrast to perceptions that security has worsened in the Afghan capital over the last 12 months, with a series of spectacular attacks on Western targets, such as the US Embassy siege.


The Afghan Army was now almost 180,000-strong, the Afghan Police has nearly 144,000 men and women in uniform, and by spring of this year security responsibility for more than 50 per cent of Afghanistan will be under Afghan control, he said.

After receiving a joint briefing from Lt Col Lawrence and the Governor about the redevelopment of the area, the Ambassador took a tour of the town with Afghan and British security forces.


The tour took in the village school, a farming techniques training centre, a medical facility, and the bazaar.


Sir William said:




You come to this district and this is where it is all delivered. It was good to meet the Governor and hear what his needs were. What really impressed me was the co-operation between the international forces, the international officials here and the Governor. An Afghan, international supported effort is of the utmost importance.




As he toured the town, the new Ambassador took time to speak with local nationals and officials to discover what help the International Security Assistance Force has been able to offer and what else the people needed to continue the redevelopment of this once prosperous region.


Lt Col Lawrence commented on the day’s visit:




I thought it went very well indeed. The briefing gave him [the Ambassador] a good idea of the broader area, and then the walk around the centre this morning with the District Governor allowed the Governor to tell the Ambassador exactly what he has managed to achieve.




Sir William added:




It is interesting for me to come and walk around a bazaar and meet some local people. It is a good start to my time in Afghanistan.

Corporal Stephen Curley, Royal Marines


Corporal Stephen Curley was 26 years old and was born in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. Married to Kirianne, he lived in Exeter with their five-month-old son William. He joined Royal Marines Recruit Training at the Commando Training Centre Royal Marines on 31 March 2003, passing for duty on 17 March 2004.


On completion of training he was drafted to Charlie Company, 40 Commando Royal Marines, and subsequently deployed to Iraq on Operation TELIC 4 in 2004. 2006 saw his first deployment to Afghanistan on Op HERRICK 5, serving with Lima Company, 42 Commando Royal Marines, during which he distinguished himself by saving a fellow Marine’s life. Further training with 42 Commando on exercise in northern Norway provided him with experience of operating in a mountain and cold weather environment.


Established as an experienced and professional Marine, he was selected for Command Training, passing his Junior Command Course and being promoted to Corporal in March 2009. A keen runner and climber with a taste for cold weather warfare, Corporal Curley chose to volunteer for the arduous nine-month Mountain Leaders Course, becoming a qualified Mountain Leader (Class 2) in April 2009.


Rejoining Charlie Company, 40 Commando Royal Marines, in September 2009, he undertook the Advanced Urban Combat Instructor’s Course, a role he relished within 7 Troop. In March 2010 he deployed once again to Afghanistan on Op HERRICK 12, serving in Sangin as part of the Forward Operating Base (FOB) Jackson Operations Company.


On the late afternoon of Wednesday 26 May 2010, Charlie Company was conducting a foot patrol in and around the southern Green Zone to reassure the local nationals and understand their concerns. At 1831hrs local time in the Sangin area an explosion occurred and as a result Corporal Curley was killed in action.


His wife, Kirianne, said:




It is impossible for me to express what my husband meant to me; daddy to our 18-week-old son, William, and my partner in crime, Stevie was my purpose, what makes me tick.






A man of few but powerful words when it mattered, he lived by the motto ‘If you’re not living life on the edge, you’re taking up too much room’. This will be forever imprinted on our hearts.






Stevie was a perfectionist - he prided himself on being the best and the best he was. His professionalism was highly regarded by all who knew him but it was his quirky, un-PC one-liners that really caused a stir. Steve loved to make people laugh and laugh with them.






Stevie was a quietly proud man, proud to be a Royal, proud to be my husband and proud to be a daddy.






Steve stood firmly for what he believed in; a man who lived by his convictions and fought vehemently for what he thought was right.






Steve loved his family, and would be so proud of his mother and brother. We will carry your heart with us always. Engraved in my wedding ring the words ‘Kirianne, my one, my love, my wife’. Stephen, sleep well my love.




Corporal Curley’s mother Andrea and brother Sean said:




Ste was extremely proud of his northern roots. As a child his favourite place to visit along with older brother Sean was the cafe gift shop in Helmsley, North Yorkshire. Another was the unheated, outdoor swimming pool in Otley which he would take great joy in jumping into; the water was always freezing cold - perhaps this was early training for the Marines!






His best friend Andrew Birmingham, who he met at the age of three and went through St Joseph’s Junior and St John Fisher High School with, is currently flying back to the UK from Australia. Ste leaves so many friends in the area with whom he remained in contact after leaving home and all are deeply saddened.






When Ste was in sixth form he worked at the local McDonald’s so we always said it was McDonald’s to the Marines for him. We were all immensely proud of him when he joined the Royal Marines and know just how much being a Marine meant to him.






He always looked up to his older brother Sean and it meant so much to them both when at one period they served together in Afghanistan. Quite simply, without Stephen, Sean and I are lost.




Lieutenant Colonel Paul James, Commanding Officer, 40 Commando Group, Combined Force Sangin, said:




Corporal Stephen Curley was the very best of his generation; bright, fit, charismatic and supremely brave, he was a man who genuinely inspired others. Based with me in FOB Jackson, I saw in him a selfless, loyal, utterly dedicated and natural leader of men.






He died on patrol in Sangin leading the men he loved, and alongside the men who loved him. His sharp wit knew few limits, particularly in the gymnasium where he reigned supreme, with both the RSM [Regimental Sergeant Major] and I regularly in the firing line.






As a Marine he was professionally unrivalled - a Mountain Leader, a consummate tactician and a brilliant Section Commander who cared passionately for his men.






Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Kirianne and new-born son William, his family and his friends. He will be desperately missed by everyone in 40 Commando. Corporal Stephen Curley was, and always will be, a Royal Marine Commando.




Major Ed Moorhouse, Officer Commanding Charlie Company, 40 Commando Royal Marines, said:




Corporal Steve Curley is irreplaceable as a man, a leader and a Royal Marines Corporal. He was the most consummate of all-round professionals and a man who I can proudly say that I have had the immense privilege to have commanded and worked alongside.






Fiercely proud of being a Royal Marine and a Mountain Leader, he was a natural leader of Marines and had galvanised a group of young men in 7 Troop into an exceptionally strong and dynamic section who he was proud to call his own. At the heart of this single-minded professionalism was his energy and enthusiasm for everything, complemented by an utter vitality for life and the challenges that it brought.






Nothing was ever too onerous for him and the more austere and challenging the task, the more he would revel in undertaking it; this infectious enthusiasm drove everything that he did, and all ranks in Charlie Company were energised by it.






A man with the driest sense of humour and a wry Yorkshire wit, nobody in Charlie Company was safe from a Steve Curley one-liner no matter what rank or status you carried; the Sergeant Major and I speak from personal experience.






Charlie Company Group mourns the passing of an exceptional young man who has touched us all during his tragically short life; a man who personified everything in the Charlie Company ‘Spartan’ ethos. I have no doubt that he would have risen to the highest echelons of the Royal Marines and I would have taken great pleasure and pride in championing this assent.






Our prayers and thoughts are with his wife Kirianne and his new-born son William; I am only saddened that this young man, unlike me, will never know just what a formidable and unique leader of men his father was.




Sergeant Danny ‘Smudger’ Smith, Troop Sergeant, 7 Troop, Charlie Company, 40 Commando Royal Marines, said:




Is it wrong for a Troop Sergeant to be inspired by one of his Corporals? If it is, I am guilty of that. I had the absolute pleasure of working with Steve as a Marine and then had the honour of instructing him on his Junior Command Course. In true ‘Steve fashion’ he was among the front-runners throughout.






I was then privileged again to be given Steve as one of my Section Commanders, on completion of his Mountain Leaders Course, for our current tour in Afghanistan. Nothing could have delighted me more. Words cannot explain the immeasurable impact that Steve Curley has had, not just on the troop, but the whole of Charlie Company; he is irreplaceable.






As a Troop Sergeant you are expected to be the man the guys look to for advice, so why did I always find myself looking to Steve? Steve was unbelievably good at what he did and without fail he always managed to make the right choice.






The men of 7 Troop idolised him, he was their oracle and best friend. I have never met another man with such an amazing sense of humour; every bad situation could be made into a hilarious joke which of course meant he had a natural ability to pick the lads up when the chips were down.






The tragic loss of our closest brother has left an immense hole in a very tight troop. It is a fact that 7 Troop has evolved around Steve Curley and has adopted his professionalism and skills; this is his true legacy to us. Steve was a best friend and a true Spartan and will always remain a fantastic role model to myself and the boys.




Corporal Dave Martin, Section Commander, 7 Troop, Charlie Company, 40 Commando Royal Marines, said:




From the day I met Steve Curley, when he welcomed me to 7 Troop, we were always in competition: in the gym, in the field, tactics, shooting, who had the best tan, who was more essence - however, every day he would just be that little bit better than me. With that cheeky smile and cutting sense of humour he would make me laugh constantly. He was a great soldier, but more than that he was a great friend. Rest in Peace.




Corporal Carl Saunders, 1 Troop, Alpha Company, 40 Commando Royal Marines, said:




What can be said about Steve that people don’t already know? Sitting writing this I honestly don’t believe any words can do him justice, his actions and personality speak louder than words ever could. I’ve had the pleasure of knowing Steve as a friend for over five years and I believe that I am a better man for knowing him.






Ever since HERRICK 5 his professionalism has shone through, always leading from the front. Physically he was leaps and bounds ahead of everyone else, surprising when you consider how short he was! Speaking to him after he successfully passed his Mountain Leaders 2 Course he simply described it as ‘just phys in the bag’.






He leaves behind a beautiful wife and child whom he loved very much. Sleep well mate, a true legend, I’ll miss you.




Lance Corporal Luke Metcalfe, Section Second-in-Command, 7 Troop, Charlie Company, 40 Commando Royal Marines, said:




As a Section Second-in-Command, Steve was someone I looked up to through his professionalism, the way he dealt with situations and just his general jokey character. He was by far one of the best Bootnecks I’ve ever come across and it made perfect sense to me that he was a Mountain Leader.






There is now a massive gap in 7 Troop, as a Section Commander and a friend. Even though for much of the time you could just hear his ridiculous northern accent and jokes, he always made sense to me and I learnt from him continuously.






I’ll miss our nights out in Taunton, and our flat in Norton Manor Camp will never be the same again. Rest in Peace Steve Curley, you’ll be sorely missed.




Marine ‘Dougie’ Douglas, 7 Troop, Charlie Company, 40 Commando Royal Marines, said:




No words I write or say can even come close to describe the man Steve was. Although I knew Steve for only a short time, such was the effect on people that he had, I know it will last a lifetime. Steve was not only a hoofing Bootneck on operations, he was a great mate. He was by far the biggest character in our troop and he will always be missed. Rest in Peace Steve, we will miss you always.




Marine Dan Gaul, 7 Troop, Charlie Company, 40 Commando Royal Marines, said:




Steve was an incredible soldier that you could always rely upon. Every time I went on patrol with him in Sangin, I felt as safe as I possibly could; he was hoofing at his job and always looked out for the lads. He would never let his guard down on patrol, he was like a robot that never switched off. A true Bootneck through and through. Rest in Peace Steve, you won’t be forgotten.




Marine Chris McCallum, 7 Troop, Charlie Company, 40 Commando Royal Marines, said:




On meeting Steve he immediately made an impact on you. His attitude was completely professional no matter what he was tasked to do. You felt at ease being led by him, and would follow him to the end of the world. He was a true Royal Marine and bled the Corps Colours. Rest in Peace Steve; father, husband and Bootneck.




Marine Ashley Palmer, 7 Troop, Charlie Company, 40 Commando Royal Marines, said:




It was an honour to work with Corporal Steve Curley as he always knew what he was doing in any situation. He was a highly professional Bootneck and an inspiration to us all. He was always smiling and bringing morale to the lads whether ashore or sunbathing with his socks on so he could look more tanned and essence. He was a great character, I looked up to him in everything that he did and I will miss him as a great soldier and a friend. Rest in Peace Steve Curley.




Marine James Twigg, 7 Troop, Charlie Company, 40 Commando Royal Marines, said:




Steve inspired confidence in us all through his character and professionalism. It was reassuring having him as your leader out on the ground in Sangin. He always made sure you were okay while doing his job to the highest standard.




Marine Rory O’Farrell, 7 Troop, Charlie Company, 40 Commando Royal Marines, said:




In the short time I have spent in Charlie Company, I realise how big a part Steve played in 7 Troop. He was extremely professional and a proud man and always taught the lads new and better ways to soldier. Steve knew when to have a laugh and when to soldier; just Steve alone was enough morale for the lads to get on with the day ahead. Steve will be missed and never forgotten; as everyone says, Steve was the Charlie Company Spartan - Rest in Peace Steve.




Marine Adam Gunningham, 7 Troop, Charlie Company, 40 Commando Royal Marines, said:




I couldn’t have asked for a better Corporal; he was an inspiration to me and made me a better soldier. Steve was a very proud man who always spoke his mind, no matter what he was thinking. He always looked at the funny side of things and was a constant source of morale around the troop whether ashore or in a ditch somewhere on Dartmoor. I had the utmost respect for Steve and he will always be in my thoughts, as will his family. Rest in Peace Steve Curley, I’ll always remember you.




Marine Rob Maltby, 7 Troop, Charlie Company, 40 Commando Royal Marines, said:




Steve, a Bootneck through and through. A friend, loved by all that met him. He was a larger-than-life character and respected by all for his professional attitude to every situation, whether it was ashore or at work. I am a better Royal Marine for knowing Steve and will miss him greatly. Rest in Peace Steve Curley, I will always remember you.




Marine James Clare, 7 Troop, Charlie Company, 40 Commando Royal Marines, said:




I first met Corporal Steve Curley when I joined 7 Troop, Charlie Company, late last year. It was very evident early on that through his professionalism and larger-than-life character that he was a highly respected Section Commander and Mountain Leader. I have become a better Royal Marine through working with Steve and he will certainly not be forgotten.




Secretary of State for Defence, Dr Liam Fox, said:




Corporal Stephen Curley has made the ultimate sacrifice for his country. His colleagues describe him as an inspiration, a leader and a dear friend, and my deepest sympathies go out to them and his family. He was killed at the heart of the insurgency in Sangin whilst undertaking the vital job of reassuring the local population. He will not be forgotten.

This now brings the total Ministry of Defence spend on the Community Covenant Grant Scheme to £5 million in just over a year.


The new Community Covenant Grant projects announced today include:
* funding for a new support centre for veterans and their families in Nottinghamshire;
* an innovative peer-mentoring scheme to help young people from the Armed Forces integrate into communities in Cornwall;
* helping veterans find work in Glasgow; and 
* three projects to bring together the Armed Forces and local communities in Bradford.


The Minister for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans Mark Francois said:




These latest projects demonstrate the high regard the public has for the Armed Forces and I am delighted that people up and down the country continue to show their support and gratitude through each new idea and initiative. As a former Territorial Army officer I welcome any project which will help forge closer links between the Armed Forces and their local communities.




The Community Covenant scheme was launched in June 2011 and since then nearly 150 local authorities across the UK have pledged their support to the Armed Forces and signed up to a Community Covenant, including cities such as London, Edinburgh and Liverpool.


The government also made £30 million available for communities to establish their own projects and kick start initiatives that will make real change for Armed Forces and their families.


Notes to Editors






The Armed Forces Covenant is a statement of the moral obligation which exists between the nation, the Government and the Armed Forces. The Government has already taken swift action to improve the lives of service personnel, veterans and their families. This includes:
* a £15 million investment in prosthetics provision; 
* improvements to mental healthcare; 
* a scholarship scheme for bereaved service children; 
* priority on the Government’s First Buy scheme for members of the Armed Forces in England; 
* Doubling Council Tax Relief twice, which now stands at nearly £600 per service person for a six-month deployment; 
* tax free operational allowance has doubled so those serving on eligible operations now receive a lump sum of just over £5,000 for a six-month tour; and
* new online postcodes to ensure service personnel stationed overseas have improved access to online and financial services.

This is part of a long-term programme to radically transform the way corporate services are provided to the department.


Defence Business Services (
DBS
)
 stood up on 4 July 2011 and provides a range of corporate services, including human resources, finance, information and vetting, from a single structure to all areas of the department.


Serco
 will work with 
DBS
 to transform the organisation into an efficient shared services centre which builds on private sector best practice.


Over its 4-year duration, the value of the contract is around £36m, but there is an option for the department to extend this for a further year. The contract is based on a zero management fee, with all Serco’s earnings being performance-related.


Serco will be strongly incentivised to drive down costs and deliver efficiencies, and savings in the order of around £71m are expected to be achievable over the life of the contract.


Mr Hammond said:




Today marks a defining moment in our efforts to radically change the way we do business in the Ministry of Defence by awarding a contract to Serco to lead, manage and transform the Defence Business Services organisation.






This is an exciting and challenging time for the department; the new Serco management team have first-hand experience of making similar changes in the wider public and private sector, improving performance through innovation.






We are committed to working in partnership with Serco to make this transformation a success and to deliver efficiencies and savings which will allow more resources to be made available to the front line.




The 10-day standstill period, also known as Alcatel, is mandatory between contract award and contract conclusion to enable transparency in the award process and allow any potential challenges to be addressed before contract signature.


A competition was carried out using the competitive dialogue process, involving KPMG with CSC, IBM with Deloitte, and Serco with Accenture, to seek a potential commercial management partner for 
DBS
.


As part of this process a number of issues have been considered including value for money, deliverability of efficiencies, and how best to enable transformational change. Following an intense period of dialogue, the competition closed in December 2011, with final bids due in just before Christmas.


A number of options have been explored and it has been decided that the best long-term solution is to bring in a commercial management team from Serco to lead and transform 
DBS
.


One of the key drivers is our need to deliver more efficient and affordable corporate services, and Serco will work with 
DBS
 staff to transform the organisation into a lean exemplar shared services centre which builds on private sector best practice.


DBS
 itself will continue to be a part of the MOD, and personnel working in 
DBS
 will be employed in the same way as all other MOD staff, with the same terms and conditions of service.

The move to identify it as a project of concern comes after it was reviewed during the second meeting of the Major Projects Review Board (MPRB) that holds the top 50 equipment projects, with a total value of more than £100bn, to account.


The MPRB was established by the Defence Secretary last June to deliver tighter financial controls across the Department.


This week, the committee reviewed the Falcon communications system, the Watchkeeper surveillance system, and the Valiant Jetty project, which will serve the new Astute Class submarines at HM Naval Base Clyde.


Dr Fox said:




It is clear that the additional rigour and scrutiny being applied through the Major Projects Review Board is having a beneficial effect on the behaviours of our suppliers.






I am pleased that both Falcon and Watchkeeper have made progress since the Board’s first meeting. However, I am not satisfied with the progress of the Valiant Jetty project. It is almost four years late and over budget.






We must learn from the mistakes of the past and move away from the culture of optimism. Too frequently projects ran over-budget and over-time, without any meaningful remedial action. Real budgetary discipline can only be achieved through the effective real-time control of project budgets. Our Armed Forces and our country simply cannot afford anything less.




The Valiant Jetty project will deliver base porting facilities for the UK submarine fleet for the next 50 years. Its contract states that the project should have been completed in October 2008. AMEC’s estimate of earliest completion is now nearly four years after then, and their latest cost estimate is almost 70 per cent more than the contractual maximum price of £134m, though this is subject to ongoing negotiation.


The project will therefore be reviewed again at the next MPRB meeting in December. It will continue to remain under close scrutiny until sufficient progress has been made and this important capability is delivered.


The purpose of the MPRB is to provide rigorous senior oversight of the Department’s major projects, to identify those that are in danger of failing, and to take decisive action either to get a project back on track or, if necessary, to terminate it. Its membership comprises the Secretary of State, the Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology, the Chief of Defence Materiel, and the Deputy Chief of Defence Staff (Capability).


The MPRB has met twice. So far it has considered three projects in detail, of which one has been identified as a project of concern. Other projects will be considered at future meetings.


The Falcon project recently passed an important milestone and, while there is still work to be done, the Board is satisfied that it can be kept under review below the level of the MPRB.


Watchkeeper has made some progress since the last MPRB, but, given the importance of delivering this capability to Afghanistan and the residual risk, the MPRB will look at it again around the turn of the year.

Operation MOSHTARAK was carried out to extend the authority of the Afghan Government in central Helmand, removing the largest remaining safe havens in the area for the Taliban.


This improved freedom of movement along key transport routes, allowing the local economy to flourish. It also made Nad ‘Ali a more secure place to live.


This year’s pre-election shuras, held throughout the Nad ‘Ali district, were attended by approximately 3,600 local people - an amazing number considering this is an area that only a year ago was considered unsafe.


At these shuras, the elders discussed and nominated the candidates for the 18 electoral zones.


Although there were still some reports of intimidation towards candidates by the insurgents, security provided by the Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police, supported by International Security Assistance Force troops, allowed the election to proceed smoothly and without incident.


The District Governor, Habibullah Khan, welcomed his guests and said:




We are here to nominate a new District Community Council and we can then resolve your local issues in a democratic way.




This election was unique as it was the first time that representation had been given to the people from the ‘desert zone’ of the Nad ‘Ali region.


They now have seven candidates on the District Community Council who will provide a democratic voice for them to discuss their specific issues at district-level.


Insurgents have previously targeted those who are dislocated from local communities in order to influence and recruit them.


By having a democratic stake in the District Community Council, the people from the desert region have been reconnected and have a claim in their own political future, making them less susceptible to Taliban influence.


The Deputy Provincial Governor of Helmand, Abdul Sattar, who was present at the election representing the Provincial Governor, Gulab Mangal, said:




I am very happy to be here today and see the hundreds of elders who have come here from all over the Nad ‘Ali area to this election.






It is important that you nominate senior, loyal and democratic people to represent you.






This is a clear demonstration that locals can take decisions for their future. This is democracy; we have struggled for over three decades for this system. Thanks to all of you for trusting democracy.




The election process was organised and overseen by the Independent Directorate for Local Government together with Governor Mangal.


The Helmand Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) provided support with the Helmand Afghan Social Outreach Programme, a UK-funded governance programme designed to develop and implement district councils as a bridge between local communities and government.


PRT Governance Advisor, Derek Griffiths, said:




This election clearly demonstrates the willingness and enthusiasm of the local nationals across the whole district to get involved in the democratic debate. The security situation last year would have made what has happened today unthinkable.




Three other district councils in Helmand province have already been voted for in addition to the District Community Council in Nad ‘Ali. They are in Gereshk, Nawa and Garmsir.

The highly-equipped Sandown Class ship is off to join a NATO task force carrying out mine countermeasures exercises and operations in both the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.


Hunt Class minehunter HMS Ledbury and her ship’s company of 42 sailed in early January. Since then Ledbury has clocked up 12,000 nautical miles (22,224km), and has spent her time operating with NATO’s permanent mine countermeasures group, assisting with the task of clearing the Mediterranean of historic ordnance left from the World Wars and more recent conflicts, and conducting a series of exercises.


See Related News to read more on HMS Ledbury’s Mediterranean deployment.


The ship and her crew have sailed around most of the Mediterranean in their six-month deployment, visiting 18 ports in eight countries including Malta, Sicily, Croatia, Spain, Portugal and Italy. There were also two visits to key North African countries as part of NATO’s role in the Mediterranean.


During recent training off the coast of Sardinia, HMS Ledbury worked with Italian counterparts to destroy a live Second World War German sea mine that had been spotted by Ledbury’s skilled operators using the ship’s sophisticated sonar at a depth of 43 metres. The ship’s remote-controlled mini submarine Seafox was used to beam live video back to the ship, enabling mine clearance divers to detonate the aged ordnance safely.


Lieutenant Commander Tony Williams, Commanding Officer of HMS Ledbury, said:




I am very proud of the efforts of my crew, who have unrelentingly displayed their professionalism and fortitude from the moment we started preparing for this deployment over a year ago.






The deployment has been challenging but very rewarding and I am particularly proud of my team’s efforts in finding and destroying the mine off Sardinia.






My crew and I would like to thank all those who have supported us during this deployment and we are all very glad to be home with our families after such a long time away.




Lieutenant Hamish Maxwell, Navigating Officer on HMS Blyth, said:




The Mediterranean provides a testing and different environment to what the ship’s company have experienced in Scotland, which makes it an ideal location for us to develop our capabilities.

Captain James Anthony Townley


Captain James Townley was born on 22 September 1982 in Tunbridge Wells. He grew up near Glastonbury in Somerset, going to school in the local area.


Having received a first-class degree in Engineering and Computer Science from University College Oxford, he worked as a tax associate for Price Waterhouse Coopers before attending the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in January 2007.


He commissioned into the Corps of Royal Engineers in December 2007 and promoted to Lieutenant soon after completing his Royal Engineer Troop Commanders’ Course before serving in 28 Engineer Regiment, based in Hameln, Germany.


Captain Townley was an avid sportsman who enjoyed a wide variety of sports including skiing, mountain biking, kite surfing and sailing. Having rowed for his college at university, he later went on to represent the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and his regiment.


Captain Townley was attached to 21 Engineer Regiment from 28 Engineer Regiment for the duration of Operation Herrick 17. He deployed to Afghanistan on 5 September 2012 with 4 Armoured Engineer Squadron, 21 Engineer Regiment and was based in the Nad ‘Ali district of Helmand Province as the Battle Group Engineer supporting 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment.


Upon arrival, he immediately immersed himself in operations that directly supported the transition to Afghan-led security, providing specialist advice on engineer tasks and capabilities. He had quickly established himself as a professional and charismatic officer.


In his time with 28 Engineer Regiment he shone as an intelligent, experienced and highly competent individual who had great plans for the future. With unrivalled commitment to his soldiers, he combined consummate professionalism and ability with a personable, humorous and approachable character.


Extremely popular with his fellow officers, Captain Townley lived life to the full and was at the heart of the Regiment both professionally and socially.


Above everything else, he will be remembered for his selfless commitment to every undertaking, his strength of character and his faultless integrity.


Captain James Townley, was a remarkable young man. He leaves behind his parents, Peter and Jacqui, his brother, Nick, and girlfriend, Helen.


Capt Townley’s family said:




James was a wonderful, loving and caring son and brother. He was devoted to his girlfriend, Helen. He was our guardian angel and our hero. We were so proud of him. He touched every part of our lives and his loss has left a huge chasm that we can never fill.


James will never be forgotten and always in our hearts and thoughts.




Lieutenant Colonel Chas Story, Commanding Officer, 28 Engineer Regiment, said:




James was an exceptional officer, a great character and unbelievably clever. The Regiment is devastated that such a bright light has gone out - everyone knew him and it was impossible not to be drawn in by his passion and humour. He was on his third tour of Afghanistan and a volunteer for all three. He joined to be a soldier and he was determined to make the most of all the opportunities he could. The Regiment will be a poorer place without James.


In this painful time our thoughts remain with his family, his girlfriend Helen and all his friends. He was an outstanding individual and throughout his life he has made a massive difference to all those he encountered. He will never be forgotten.




Lieutenant Colonel Jack Nicholson, Commanding Officer, 21 Engineer Regiment, said:




Captain James Townley was an enthusiastic, professional and extremely likeable young officer who made friends easily. Back in Afghanistan for his third tour, he had worked hard to prepare for the deployment and was looking forward to getting to grips with the challenges that lay ahead. In the time that I have known him, he was always cheerful, polite and full of energy - a real pleasure to command.


His tragic loss has stunned the Regiment, and we are all trying to come to terms with this awful event. He had many friends throughout the Corps and his loss will be deeply felt by all those who had the privilege of serving alongside him.


Our heartfelt condolences are with his parents, Peter and Jacqui, his brother, Nick and girlfriend, Helen. I cannot begin to imagine the pain they are feeling, but the thoughts and prayers of the whole Regiment are with them at this most difficult time.




Major Spence McComb, Officer Commanding, 42 Field Squadron, 28 Engineer Regiment, said:




Captain James ‘JT’ Townley was a star within 28 Engineer Regiment, having served with us for the last four years. An exceptionally intelligent young officer with notably sharp analytical and planning skills, his military career was flourishing.


Nothing was too much for JT, he would always be on hand to help out his fellow officers or soldiers; he would never put himself first, and he was someone who could be relied on.


He was held in immensely high regard by his brother officers with whom he had some very strong bonds; all his soldiers looked up to him. We all enjoyed his witty banter and respected his sense of duty - he will be very sorely missed.




Major Garreth Dent, Officer Commanding, 4 Armoured Engineer Squadron, 21 Engineer Regiment, said:




Captain James Townley joined my Squadron as we prepared for deployment to Afghanistan. His professionalism and keen intellect meant he made an immediate impression on us all and in only a few short weeks he had become an integral part of our headquarters. Although I knew him for only a short time, it was long enough to understand that he was a dedicated and loyal engineer officer with a bright future ahead of him.


This was James’s third tour of Afghanistan and he remained determined to make a difference. He was relishing the challenges the tour would bring and had thrown himself wholeheartedly into his role as Battle Group Engineer to the transition support unit in Nad ‘Ali. He worked tirelessly to coordinate the delivery of engineering projects he knew would improve the lives of the local Afghan population.


James was an ambitious and driven individual who had great plans for the future and his career beyond this deployment. His loss will be felt keenly by all who knew him, however briefly, and the thoughts and prayers of all his colleagues are with his family and friends at this difficult time.




Captain Richard Pearce, Regimental Operations Officer, 28 Engineer Regiment, said:




James Townley and I completed Sandhurst together, commissioning into the Royal Engineers and serving together in multiple theatres.


James, or ‘JT’ to his friends, was a good officer and a great guy. He combined a vast intellect and professional ability with a likeable demeanour and infectious enthusiasm. As a fellow officer he was hugely impressive; his ability to digest and analyse information in a split second was incredible and I have no doubt he would have excelled in anything he chose to do.


As a friend one could simply ask for no better; his spirit of adventure ensured that spontaneous road trips kite surfing or skiing around Europe were aplenty. A genuine friend, ‘JT’ would always make the effort to catch up, often turning up with the makings of a good cocktail.


‘JT’ will be sorely missed, both as a fellow officer and a friend. Our thoughts are with his family at this sad time.




Captain Luke Wilson, Regimental Signals Officer, 21 Engineer Regiment, said:




James Townley was the epitome of a British Army officer; fit, reliable, intelligent and absolutely trustworthy. He also had a wicked sense of humour which you could always tell was near the surface by the tiniest of grins and a glint in his eye. He was a man of considerable but understated achievement; a degree from Oxford and being in the Sovereign’s Platoon at Sandhurst to name just two. He excelled at everything he tried yet never flaunted his considerable abilities.


I first encountered ‘JT’ on the River Isis at Oxford when he rowed for his college crew. Dressed in Lycra and Wellington boots I was struck, not only by his dress sense, but by his stoic commitment to the task in hand and sheer will to win, attributes that he would display repeatedly during his time in the Army.


As an officer he was second to none and loved what he did, taking care of those under his command and supporting those around him. He was utterly dedicated in everything he did and had already made an impact here in Afghanistan, impressing his battlegroup with his intellectual prowess and sound judgement.


His great passion was sailing and in 2010 he led an expedition along the coast of Croatia. When stories of his escapades came back, they were soon written into Regimental legend. However he never corroborated any of them and it was only that small grin and little glint of the eye that told you there was more to it than he was prepared to admit.






‘JT’ was the best officer I have ever met and the Royal Engineers and the Army has lost a most loyal servant. He was a steadfast friend to those who knew him and never had a bad word to say about anyone. The phrase that he always brought to my mind was that he had ‘heightened sensitivity to the promises of life’.


He was always ready and willing to exploit every opportunity and see what was new in the world. He left everywhere he went all the better for him being there and I am proud to have had the honour of knowing and working with him.




Captain Ash Greenwood, Operations Officer, 4 Armoured Engineer Squadron, 21 Engineer Regiment, said:




If life was for living then ‘JT’ made the most of every minute. Intelligent, astute and with a dry sense of humour, ‘JT’ made the best of every situation. Words cannot express the grief caused by his passing and the thoughts of all of his friends within the Corps are with his family and his girlfriend Helen. We will never forget you.




Lieutenant Brad Southall, Support Troop Commander, 42 Field Squadron, 28 Engineer Regiment, said:




I first met ‘JT’ in the 28 Engineer Regiment Officers’ Mess and he immediately struck me as a friendly, genuine and funny individual. He was a very busy man, always putting in maximum time and effort to everything he did, yet would always make time to pass on his considerable knowledge and experience to anyone who asked, no matter what the subject. If ever I knew anyone who was going to make his millions it was ‘JT’! He always had a comical outlook on the topic of discussion, offering up his opinion, usually tinged with a facetious edge, which endeared him to everyone he knew.


We often spoke and it was clearly apparent that he was full of optimism about his future and very much looked forwards to spending more time with his girlfriend Helen. I am truly shocked by his death and deeply saddened. He is a friend who will be sorely missed by all who knew him. My thoughts are with his family, friends and girlfriend in what is undoubtedly an incredibly difficult time.




Lieutenant Mike Thorne, 7 Troop Commander, 42 Field Squadron, 28 Engineer Regiment, said:




The tragic loss of a good friend and fellow officer is a crushing blow to all those that knew him. ‘JT’ as he was known to his friends, spent his entire career in Hameln. He was well known, hugely liked and respected within the Officers’ Mess and the wider Regiment.


As a Troop Commander in the same squadron, I had the distinct privilege of working closely with him as well as living in the same Officers’ Mess. A sharp and witty individual, he regularly brought humour to his environment. Always the first to deliver a hilarious and cutting comment to events within our Mess, he was definitely the person to be around when looking for laughs.


Highly dynamic, he regularly found activities to take part in and did his best to facilitate those around him joining in. A true friend he was always prepared to help those who needed it. I personally owe him for the many hours he spent in the evenings helping me with my career development, as well as the advice and help he has given me with the job in hand.


He cared a lot for his personal life and spoke fondly of his family and girlfriend Helen. He often discussed excitedly his intentions for his future career and the opportunity to be able to spend more time with those he cared about.


The loss to those of us on tour and back in Hameln is huge, albeit incomparable to that of his family and Helen. My thoughts go to them in this tragic time.




Warrant Officer Class 2 Tristan Barnett, Squadron Sergeant Major, 4 Armoured Engineer Squadron, 21 Engineer Regiment, said:




I first met Captain Townley in our Squadron Headquarters a few weeks prior to deployment. Although not part of our regular team, he made an instant effort to integrate himself into our way of life and training regime. During the high tempo of pre-deployment training this effort was immediately recognised and quickly earned him the respect of all ranks across the Squadron.


Captain Townley’s diligence and attention to detail were key to the challenges and tasks facing him as a Battle Group Engineer. This did not seem to faze him, and during my discussions with him he was revelling in the challenges that this job had to offer.


It seems very cliched, but Captain Townley will be sorely missed, and this tragic incident will have a significant impact on all that knew him. All within 4 Armoured Engineer Squadron send their thoughts and prayers to his family during this difficult time.




Sergeant Adrian ‘Ad’ Dixon, Reconnaissance Sergeant, 42 Field Squadron, 28 Engineer Regiment, said:




I first met Captain Townley as a Troop Commander at 23 Amphibious Engineer Squadron. He quickly embedded himself and produced all the goods expected from a young officer. He was extremely fit, loved a sporting challenge and became a well-liked officer across the ranks. He had a cracking reputation as a Troop Commander and made a name for himself in the squadron bar and Officers’ Mess as someone who embraced the Germany way of life.


I worked with him closely as the Operations Officer for 42 Field Squadron. He threw himself straight into the role and as always gave 110 percent effort prior to deployment to Afghanistan. Captain Townley was an absolute professional, a keen workhorse who would never give up and would always complete the task to the highest of standards. This was what I was looking forward to most; working side by side with him throughout our deployment.


I’ll remember Captain Townley as a keen sailor and an excellent skipper, proven during the sailing trip we had to Croatia after our previous Afghanistan deployment. We were going to return there after this deployment, although now my thoughts will be with him during a trip that will undoubtedly miss his presence.


My thoughts go out to all his family, friends and girlfriend Helen, all of whom were a huge part of his life. He was an excellent officer and friend. He will be missed by all, especially his close friends back in 28 Engineer Regiment, Hameln.


Be strong up there ‘JT’ and we will meet again one day for a beer. Rest in Peace.




Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said:




I was deeply saddened to hear of the death of Captain Townley. I understand that he was an immensely talented and intelligent officer with a flourishing military career who was dedicated to supporting those around him. My thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.

He’s been an instructor and has flown the aircraft operationally, both as part of the UK’s Quick Reaction Alert Force and in the Falklands, so he knows the aircraft inside out:




It’s a fantastic jet to fly, is incredibly agile and can carry a flexible range of weaponry,” says Squadron Leader McMeeking. “The cockpit is great in terms of pilot interaction for both air-to-air and air-to-surface missions. The modern air battle is incredibly complex. Typhoon helps us win that battle by significantly enhancing our situational awareness.




The RAF jets based at Gioia del Colle in Italy are the FGR4 variant of the Typhoon (‘F’ for ‘fighter’ and ‘GR’ for ‘ground attack and reconnaissance’), and differ from those deployed in the UK and the Falklands which are equipped primarily for ‘air-to-air’ combat:




I’m really privileged to have got 1,000 hours while on operations with the aircraft and it’s great to see the aircraft ‘stretch its legs’ here in Italy,” continues the Squadron Leader. “This is its first war-fighting role, and our Typhoons have deployed over 100 precision guided weapons while out here.




There are six Typhoons currently stationed at Gioia del Colle air base and eleven pilots. Aircraft are not personally assigned to a pilot, so all pilots fly all aircraft. But does Squadron Leader McMeeking have a favourite?




You love the one you’re with,” he jokes. “But every jet has its personality, and our ground crew do an amazing job, putting in long hours to make sure that the aircraft are always in the best possible condition.




“They work 24/7, 365 days a year out here and they never fail to deliver. We just couldn’t do what we do without them.”


But how easy is the Typhoon to fly compared with the Tornado?




The Typhoon is a generation ahead of the Tornado in all aspects - manoeuvrability, agility, sensors - so a comparison isn’t really fair,” says Squadron Leader McMeeking.




“It’s an easy jet to learn to fly, but it takes a lot of practice to learn to operate well because of the sheer amount of information available to the pilot. I know the aircraft had its detractors during development, but what we’re seeing now on operations is proof of this great aircraft’s capability.”

The Devonport based frigate has been conducting maritime security operations in the Indian Ocean and this visit provided an opportunity to embark supplies and victuals prior to another period at sea.


HMS Somerset’s Commanding Officer, Commander Paul Bristowe said:




It is a great honour to have participated in the celebrations; the kindness of our Tanzanian hosts has been exceptional and builds on the already excellent relations the UK enjoys with the Republic of Tanzania.




Commander Bristowe and his Executive Officer Lieutenant Commander Ben Aldous attended the day of celebrations at the National Stadium. Ben Aldous said:




The ceremony was impressive; Tanzania is proud of its independence and the event marked the occasion well. Throughout the day we were reminded of the importance of tradition and the achievements of Tanzania over the last 50 years.




The ship hosted an official reception at which British Minister for International Relations Stephen O’Brien stood alongside the Tanzanian Minister of Defence and National Service, the Honourable Doctor Mwinyi, and Vice Chief of the Tanzania People’s Defence Force (TPDF), General Mwamunuange. Mr O’Brien’s speech, made partly in Swahili, warmly acknowledged Tanzania’s successes since independence.


As part of Combined Maritime Force’s capacity-building mission in combating criminal activity at sea, HMS Somerset’s Service Police Officer, Regulating Petty Officer Emma Crawley, gave an evidence-handling lecture to members of the TPDF.


On the final evening, Commander Bristowe attended a reception on Navy Beach, hosted by Major General SS Omar, the Chief of Tanzanian Navy Command, further bonding the two navies. This cultural event was well received and brought to a close a thoroughly successful and enjoyable visit.


On departure from Dar es Salaam, HMS Somerset embarked two extra guest officers for the next patrol: Lieutenant Sikuku of the Kenyan Navy, and Lieutenant Ziguye from the Tanzanian Navy. They will train with the Royal Navy, providing an opportunity for all involved to gain a better appreciation of how other navies operate.


Lieutenant Sikuku said:




This is a great opportunity for me to experience life working with the Royal Navy on board a powerful warship.




As a busy commercial port, Dar es Salaam is reliant on secure maritime trade routes; Coalition naval ships are operating in the Indian Ocean in order to ensure the ocean remains a safe environment for all legitimate mariners.


During an operational deployment, port visits are essential to conduct maintenance and to re-supply with provisions. Tanzania is ideally located to allow the ship to replenish whilst remaining close to her allocated patrol areas.


HMS Somerset is working under Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) as part of a task force which patrols the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Oman. It is a multi-national endeavour and exists to create a lawful and stable maritime environment free from terrorism, smuggling and other illegal activities. The principal mission is to deter, disrupt and defeat such actions.


Throughout Somerset’s deployment her ship’s company will continue to promote stable and cooperative relationships with nations with whom she has contact. However, she will remain at readiness to respond to any tasking.

Her Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Commander Neil Marriott, said:




Due to recent events in the Mediterranean, in particular around the coast of Libya, the UK has been requested by NATO to keep one mine countermeasures vessel on station in this area.






We have been working long and hard in preparation for operational deployment and are proud to be playing an important role helping to enforce UN Security Council Resolution 1973.




Since Christmas, HMS Bangor has been put through her paces on operational sea training in preparation for a deployment with the Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Group 1 to the North Sea, which had been planned for later this year.

HMS Bangor has also completed a major maintenance period, gearing the ship up to sail from UK waters for six months.


Built of glass-reinforced plastic, HMS Bangor’s design ensures that the ship is extremely quiet and has a very low magnetic signature, essential when operating in a minefield.


Equipped with the latest precise navigation and manoeuvring systems, which allow her to ‘hover’ over a fixed point and search for mines with a variable depth sonar - capable of detecting ordnance at depths in excess of 200m, Bangor can also deploy her clearance divers or advanced submersible to deal with mines or suspicious objects.


HMS Ocean launched her embarked British Army Apaches again on Saturday, 4 June; this time against a multiple launch rocket system positioned on the Libyan coast near Brega.


The attack helicopters used Hellfire missiles to destroy their target before returning safely to the ship. As before, these missions were supported by other NATO aircraft, including RAF Sentry, Sentinel and Nimrod surveillance aircraft, and VC-10 tankers.


Also on Saturday, RAF Tornados joined other NATO aircraft in a major strike on a large surface-to-air missile depot in Tripoli, attacking eight targets within the complex.


And yesterday, Monday 6 June, RAF ground attack aircraft struck the headquarters of Colonel Gaddafi’s military intelligence service in Tripoli.


Since the start of military operations to enforce UNSCR 1973, Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and Army Air Corps assets have successfully attacked over 410 regime targets involved in Colonel Gaddafi’s persecution of the civilian populace.

The four Enterprise Zones in Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds and Sheffield, selected by their local enterprise partnerships, will accelerate local economic growth and could create over 24,000 new jobs by 2015.


The zones will benefit from discounts on business rates, new superfast broadband, lower levels of planning control and the potential to use enhanced capital allowances. The Government will announce the location of a further ten Enterprise Zones shortly.


The Plan for Growth


The introduction of Enterprise Zones is just one of over 100 major reforms being taken forward by the Government to create conditions for strong, sustainable and balanced growth. The Government has today published a progress update against the reforms announced in the Plan for Growth.


In four months, the Government has made significant progress, working in partnership with business to fundamentally assess what every part of Government is doing to provide the conditions for private sector growth, including:




Major reform of planning policy through a new National Planning Policy Framework.


Reforms to the tax system to support business growth, including a reduction in corporation tax to 26 per cent this year, and 23 per cent by 2014 to make the UK rate the lowest in the G7.


A stop to the tide of regulation, including publishing the first results from the Red Tape Challenge.


Working in partnership with business, the launch of the Business Growth Fund by five major UK banks to support established and growing businesses through a £2.5 billion fund.


Funding for an additional 50,000 apprenticeships over the next four years and doubling the number of new University Technical Colleges, supporting young people to gain vital skills demanded by business.




A further 45 reforms are due to reach a significant milestone by the end of 2011, including a new £50 million Business Angel Co-investment Fund and the launch of the first Technology and Innovation Centre.


The Prime Minister, David Cameron, said:


“I am determined that we should drive growth in every town, city and community in the country. For too long our economy has been dependent on just one corner of the country and too few industries.


“But it won’t be Ministers in Whitehall who can drive this growth; it will be those with the great business idea who are ready to start up, the entrepreneurs who want to grow their company, the businesses looking to expand into new markets.


“That is why we are getting behind them, cutting business taxes, freeing them from red tape, easing planning restrictions and rolling out Enterprise Zones to spark business growth around the country.


“It is our dynamic businesses large and small that are on the frontline of our economic recovery and we are committed to do all that we can to ensure that they can thrive.”


The Business Secretary, Vince Cable, said:


“One of the most important things we can do to help private businesses create jobs and boost growth is to reduce the barriers businesses currently face and give them extra flexibilities to operate.


“Enterprise Zones will do exactly that, bringing in benefits to the local communities and securing investment.


“I’m delighted that Enterprise Zones are gaining momentum and we are able to confirm more locations. This will help the work local enterprise partnerships are already doing to help roll out their zones and ensure that they are a success.”

A further seven attack submarines fulfil a wide range of defence roles, including protection of the deterrent and UK forces, precision land attack utilising Tomahawk cruise missiles, anti-ship and submarine war-fighting, and special forces, intelligence and surveillance operations.


All 11 submarines are powered by a pressurised water reactor (PWR) designed to cope with a hostile underwater environment whilst minimising vulnerability to external factors including combat.


The Ministry of Defence has announced that the submarine to replace the Vanguard Class will be powered by a new nuclear power plant - PWR3. There has been speculation about the safety of the nuclear power plants in the current fleet of submarines suggesting that their design is similar to the design of the reactors at Fukushima and that the naval power plants at sea today do not have adequate safety systems; neither of these claims is true.


There are fundamental common requirements of all nuclear reactor plant designs, including the ability to maintain cooling whilst the reactor is operating and the ability to remove the heat that remains within the fuel for some time after the reactor is shut down.


Various designs of nuclear reactor plant operate across the world, with each design dealing with these fundamental safety requirements differently. The key here, however, is that our designs meet recognised and widely accepted safety requirements; we have a robust regulatory system in place to guarantee that this is demonstrably the case.


A PWR plant designed to power a submarine is very different in scale and design to the reactors at Fukushima. Whilst the precise details of what happened, and the lessons to be learnt, are still being captured, it appears clear that the resultant nuclear emergency was caused in part by the inability to circulate coolant through the shut-down reactors due to a loss of electrical power.


By contrast the nuclear power plants in all Royal Navy submarines are by design tolerant to a complete loss of power supplies as they switch to a passive cooling regime that utilises the surrounding sea to maintain cooling to the reactor core.


Nevertheless, the Royal Navy is never complacent about the safety of its vessels; a review of the evidence from Fukushima is being conducted within the defence programme in parallel with the UK civil programme.


It is a fundamental tenet of reactor plant design that safety does not rely on a single system; safety is based upon a suite of reliable, well-designed and expertly maintained safety systems and protocols with built-in redundancy.


This applies to the ability to cool the reactor both while operating or during shut down, and the ability to replace coolant if lost due to a leak. Moreover the Royal Navy does not simply claim their reactors are safe; safety is measured and compared continuously against internationally accepted and extremely stringent standards. All Royal Navy reactor plants meet these standards, and further improvements are continually sought.


There are few countries that have the capability to design, build and operate nuclear submarines. Producing a small, highly robust reactor plant contained within a submarine hull, withstanding a hostile ocean and wartime environment, and yet safe enough for the crew to live within feet of the reactor core, is a remarkable achievement.


The United Kingdom is at the forefront of this advanced technology. To protect these advantages the Royal Navy takes operational security very seriously and, understandably, does not publish any details of submarine reactor plant design or operation.


Information security, however, is never allowed to take precedence over the safety of our reactors, and detailed scrutiny of submarine nuclear safety is carried out by expert personnel from within the Ministry of Defence, the Health and Safety Executive’s Office for Nuclear Regulation, and by independent nuclear safety assessors.


In addition, the Defence Secretary takes advice on the safety of the defence nuclear programme from a committee of wholly independent and renowned experts from industry and academia. Commodore David Langbridge, Head of the Defence Nuclear Safety Regulator, has recently stated that ‘the standards set for the safety of nuclear reactors are extremely high, and are met by all the reactors used by the Royal Navy’.


The Ministry of Defence is now designing the PWR3 power plant for the successor to the Vanguard Class that will come into service in 2028 and remain operational until at least 2060. This offers the next opportunity for a significant step change in the design of the submarine PWR.


Support from the US has helped us to innovate design in PWR3 to the highest international technical and safety standards, whilst, in addition, training UK designers and engineers in US advances in reactor plant design. While the existing PWR design continues to meet all of the required safety standards PWR3 can now be designed to be even more efficient, easier to operate, better value for money, and to set new standards of safety.


Today’s Royal Navy nuclear submarines are safe, and will remain so for the future. The selection of PWR3 to power the Vanguard Class successor represents a significant advancement in the continuous development of this remarkable and vital technology.

Should such systems enter into service, they will at all times be under the control of highly trained military crews on the ground.


Speaking at the unveiling ceremony at BAE Systems in Warton, Lancashire, Minister for International Security Strategy Gerald Howarth said:




Taranis is a truly trailblazing project. The first of its kind in the UK, it reflects the best of our nation’s advanced design and technology skills and is a leading programme on the global stage.




Representing the pinnacle of UK engineering and aeronautical design, Taranis is an informal partnership of the MOD and industry talents including BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, QinetiQ and GE Aviation.


Speaking on behalf of the industry team, Nigel Whitehead, Group Managing Director of BAE Systems’ Programmes and Support business, said:




Taranis has been three-and-a-half years in the making and is the product of more than a million man-hours.


It represents a significant step forward in this country’s fast-jet capability. This technology is key to sustaining a strong industrial base and to maintain the UK’s leading position as a centre for engineering excellence and innovation.




The Taranis prototype will provide the MOD with critical knowledge on the technical and manufacturing challenges and the potential capabilities of Unmanned Combat Air Systems. Flight trials are due in 2011.

Armed Forces Day takes place in the UK on 26 June 2010 with people across the country showing their support and appreciation for serving members of the Armed Forces and for veterans who have served in the past and are not forgotten.


The first Scottish event kicks off at the Stirling Military Show on 19 June 2010 with the main celebrations taking place in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Glasgow on 26 June 2010.


Launching the Scottish events yesterday, Lorraine Kelly started off at RAF Leuchars where Air Officer Scotland handed her the Armed Forces Day flag. She then flew by rescue helicopter to Scotstoun where she was winched down into the shipyard to meet sailors on the Navy’s latest Type 45 Destroyer, HMS Diamond.


She was joined on the ship’s flight deck by the Deputy First Minister and Glasgow Lord Provost, then taken by fast rigid inflatable boat up the Clyde towards the Armadillo (with helicopter escort) to be met at the riverside by Brigadier David Allfrey and a soldier from 1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland (1 SCOTS) who helped her to raise the flag on an armoured vehicle. They then drove the vehicle along the quayside to outside the science centre tower where her journey ended.


Lorraine said:




I’m proud to be supporting Armed Forces Day again. These men and women serve our country with loyalty, bravery and professionalism, at home and abroad. I’ve felt honoured this year to meet some of these amazing people, young and old, and think they thoroughly deserve to have a special day in their honour.


I urge local people to go along to local Armed Forces Day events across Scotland, to enjoy the activities and meet our troops and veterans - we can all learn a lot from their courage and determination.




51 (Scottish) Brigade Commander, Brigadier David Allfrey, added:




Councils and communities across Scotland have really fallen in behind the armed forces and are working tremendously hard to provide celebrations and action packed days. It means a great deal to us. I hope that members of the public who don’t normally make contact with the military, take this opportunity to come along and get to know us a bit better.


Many of the military units based in Scotland are regularly deployed on operations in Afghanistan, making personal sacrifices to defend the UK from terrorism and contribute to international peace and security. They are very grateful for the incredible support that the people in Scotland show to them and their families - it gives them strength and helps them focus in the job in hand.




Lord Provost Bob Winter said:




The people of Glasgow are very proud of their armed forces. These are men and women who have been deployed in conflicts around the globe demonstrating great courage, skill and self sacrifice. It is great that Lorraine is giving our armed forces her support. It’s a really wonderful way to celebrate all that our brave soldiers, sailors and airmen do.




Over a period of two weeks there will be events over the whole of Scotland: at Dundee, Perth, Inverness, Kingussie, Kirkcaldy, Lerwick, Greenock, East Kilbride, Ayr, Keith, Dumfries, Castle Douglas, Kelso, Paisley, Spean Bridge, Wick, Dingwall, Montrose, Alloa, Stirling, Edinbugh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Kirkwall.

The commemorative medal designed to mark the Queen’s 60 years on the throne will be awarded to members of the emergency services, Prison Service and the following Armed Forces personnel:




members of the Armed Forces (Regular and Reserves) who have completed five full calendar years of service on 6 February 2012


living holders of the Victoria Cross and George Cross


members of the Royal Household.




The MOD will issue detailed qualifying criteria applying to their personnel later this summer. The one-off medal is made of nickel silver and designed by Timothy Noad, a professional calligrapher and illuminator.


The medal depicts a formal image of the Queen on one side, while the reverse shows a hexagon with a crown and royal cipher, inscribed ‘1952 to 2012’, commemorating Her Majesty’s reign, and finished off with a red ribbon and white/blue stripes.


Secretary of State for Defence, Dr Liam Fox, said:




As Defence Secretary, I see the unique nature of the service our Armed Forces give their Queen and country every day.




“They represent the very best of Britain, selflessly defending our nation and its interests, both at home and abroad, and this announcement of a Diamond Jubilee Medal for our Armed Forces gives us all the opportunity to celebrate both the Queen’s service to the country over the last 60 years and the service of our Armed Forces in her name.”


The Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir David Richards, said:




I know that our Armed Forces will be delighted they will be awarded a Diamond Jubilee Medal, both to celebrate the Queen’s reign and in recognition of the enduring sacrifice our personnel make for our country.




“This medal recognises the important and difficult job our Armed Forces have carried out defending our nation and its interests, both at home and abroad, and it is a fitting tribute to their dedication and professionalism.”

The balloon-like containers, which hold up to two tonnes of fuel each, also contain the polymer Kevlar, a flexible plastic commonly used in body armour, to keep the contents protected from enemy fire.


Measuring 4.5 feet (1.37m) in diameter when full, the Mk 5 containers can be easily transported in a sling under a helicopter or in the back of a transport aircraft. The Kevlar protection means they can also be parachuted into locations or dropped from heights of up to 25 feet (7.62m).


It means that personnel stationed at forward operating bases or check points - who rely on fuel to power the generators which provide them with heat, light, medical facilities and communications equipment - do not have to wait as long as they would for the vital supplies to be transported by road.


Flight Lieutenant John Harrison, Tactical Supply Wing Detachment commander at Camp Bastion, Helmand province, said:




The Mk 5’s give the TSW great flexibility and are a key enabler in delivering battlefield helicopters with essential fuel whilst operating at or near front line operations.






They are extremely robust and have the capability to be airlifted full of fuel and deposited wherever they are needed, usually in extremely austere locations.






This allows the battlefield helicopter to extend its reach from Camp Bastion and spend longer at the front line to deliver valuable support to ground troops. They are relatively maintenance-free and easy to operate, making them an essential bit of equipment.




Richard Holloway, Battlefield Utilities Project Team Leader for MOD’s Defence Equipment and Support, which secured the delivery of the containers, said:




These containers provide an effective, safe and quick means of delivering fuel to the front line, ensuring essential support to operations.




Designed and built in the UK, the containers have been bought under a Â£2m, five-year agreement with GKN Aerospace, based in Portsmouth.


Phil Swash, President and CEO, Aerostructures Europe, GKN Aerospace, said:




The real contribution this equipment makes to the effective functioning of our troops working in remote and forward bases is something this team and the whole site is extremely proud of.

19,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/recent-commander-in-southern-afghanistan-reports-on-progress,Recent commander in southern Afghanistan reports on progress,The former top-ranking British General in southern Afghanistan spoke yesterday about the progress made in Afghanistan over the course of the past 12 months and some of the problems still to overcome. Report by Sharon Kean.,news_story,2010-11-11T00:00:00+00:00,Ministry of Defence,"Major General Nick Carter served for 12 months in Afghanistan, stepping down earlier this month. During that time he was responsible for coalition forces in and around Kandahar and Helmand provinces.


Speaking to the media yesterday, Major General Carter said that although there were ‘green shoots’ of progress in southern Afghanistan and violence levels had decreased, it was too early to say for certain how much improvement had been made over the past year as the winter marked the end of the insurgents’ fighting season and it was typically quieter at this time of year:




Until June or July next year we won’t be entirely confident things are better, because you have to compare and contrast with June or July of this year to show that those things are really happening,” he said.




Based in Kandahar at the ISAF Regional Command Headquarters, Major General Carter initially took charge of Regional Command (South), commanding some 55,000 troops, a task he described as a ‘challenging military proposition’.


In June, the region was split and the command of Helmand and Nimruz provinces shifted to the Americans in the newly-created Regional Command (South West), leaving Major General Carter with control of Kandahar, Daykundi, Uruzgan and Zabul provinces.


In his area of operations over the past 12 months Major General Carter said that the Afghan National Security Forces had been strengthened, with four extra Afghan National Army brigades and an increase in police numbers of 30 per cent, compared to the same time last year:




It’s also the case that they [the Afghan people] are beginning to become more confident in their own security forces,” he added.






The fact that 80 per cent of the IEDs found in and around Kandahar City over the past few months have been handed in to the Afghan National Police is indicative of first of all greater trust in the Afghan National Police in Kandahar. It is also indicative perhaps of the views of the population generally in supporting the government.




He said that a redistribution of coalition troops to make Afghan security forces ‘better partnered and enabled’ was restricting insurgent activity, adding:




There is a lot less space for the insurgents to have freedom of movement in. All of the green zones around Kandahar now have a coalition and Afghan security force presence in them.






The same applies to central Helmand where there’s not much green space now that’s not under the aegis of government forces. Generally I think that the application of the resources and getting the inputs right is having an effect.

However, there were still issues to overcome with the developing Afghan National Army (ANA) and Police:




The Army will always be a challenge in the south because at the moment only five per cent of it is recruited from local southern Pashtuns,” said Major General Carter. “Whilst we are now beginning to recruit southern Pashtuns in Kandahar and Helmand into the ANA, we only have the first hundred training down in Kandahar and clearly the numbers need to increase.




He said the police represented a different challenge for coalition commanders, adding:




Loyalties in Afghanistan tend to be towards individuals rather than to institutions, and the Afghan National Police will be the solution to that situation in the south. But that’s also part of the problem we have to overcome with the loyalties of its members.




Major General Carter added that there would also be difficulties associated with developing governance in Afghanistan:




Trying to get the right quality of district governance is something that I and the command have invested a lot of energy in,” he said. “Trying to find people that are genuinely competent rather than people who are respected because of their pedigree will be a challenge for the next few months and years.




Overall there was better knowledge among commanders of the insurgency that coalition forces are tackling:




We have a really good understanding of the nature of the problem now in terms of some of the causes of the insurgency and we focus much more of our intelligence-gathering effort now on what is driving people to become insurgents,” he said.




He added that insurgent leadership had been weakened by ‘impressive’ Special Forces operations targeting mid- and low-level leaders.


However, a ‘resilient’ insurgency remained ‘alive and well’ in and around Kandahar and Helmand provinces.


Major General Carter concluded by saying he had been ‘hugely privileged’ to serve as a coalition commander and paid tribute to those who were killed in action over the past year:




We should remember the human cost in all of this,” he said. “In the year under my command I lost 302 soldiers and plus of 2,000 have life-changing injuries as a consequence of what we’ve done during the course of this year.






I think it’s absolutely right and proper that we should remember the human cost and the blood and treasure that’s been invested.

British Armed Forces, as authorised by the UN Security Council Resolution 1973, have participated in a co-ordinated strike against Libyan air defence systems.




“In addition to the Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAM) launched from a Trafalgar Class submarine, I can now confirm that the RAF has also launched Stormshadow missiles from a number of Tornado GR4 fast jets, which flew direct from RAF Marham as part of a coordinated coalition plan to enforce the resolution.”


Defence Secretary Dr Liam Fox said:




We made clear that if Gaddafi did not comply with the UN Security Council Resolution 1973, it would be enforced through military action. Our Armed Forces have therefore participated in a co-ordinated international coalition strike against key military installations.






We have launched Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles from a Trafalgar Class submarine and Stormshadow missiles from Tornado GR4s. The fast jets flew 3,000 miles from RAF Marham and back making this the longest range bombing mission conducted by the RAF since the Falklands conflict.






This operation was supported by VC10 and Tristar air-to-air refuelling aircraft as well as E3D Sentry and Sentinel surveillance aircraft.






HMS Westminster is off the coast of Libya and HMS Cumberland is in the region ready to support operations. Typhoon aircraft are also standing by to provide support.






Our capable and adaptable Armed Forces are once again displaying their courage and professionalism. This action has provided a strong signal - the International community will not stand by while the Libyan people suffer under the Gaddafi regime.




And earlier this evening (Saturday 19 March 2011) Prime Minister David Cameron said:




Tonight, British forces are in action over Libya. They are part of an international coalition that has come together to enforce the will of the United Nations and to support the Libyan people.






We have all seen the appalling brutality that Colonel Gaddafi has meted out against his own people. And far from introducing the ceasefire he spoke about, he has actually stepped up the attacks and the brutality that we can all see.






So what we are doing is necessary, it is legal, and it is right.






It is necessary because, with others, we should be trying to prevent him using his military against his own people.






It is legal, because we have the backing of the United Nations Security Council and also of the Arab League and many others.






And it is right because we believe we should not stand aside while this dictator murders his own people.






Tonight, of course our thoughts should be with those in our armed services who are putting their lives at risk in order to save the lives of others. They are the bravest of the brave.






But I believe we should all be confident that what we are doing is in a just cause and in our nation’s interest.

The Cycling for Heroes tour began on 1 May 2012 at Gordon Barracks in Aberdeen, where it was due to end today. In between, Sandy has visited over 50 military bases across the country, in places as far afield as Anglesey, Devon, Essex and Yorkshire.


The last leg began this week at RAF Lossiemouth in North East Scotland.


During the trip Sandy has already raised £4,000 for the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association (SSAFA); he also wanted to raise awareness of the SSAFA Bereaved Families Support Group which has been a great help to him since the death of his son. He said:




Everyone copes in different ways when something like this happens and it is such a help to talk to people who have already been through the same thing.




It has been quite a journey for Sandy, who hadn’t been on a bike for 20 years before he set off from Aberdeen on 1 May this year, and it has taken him right around the UK visiting a total of 52 military bases in 31 days. His most recent visit was to RAF Lossiemouth.


He has had six punctures, battled extreme heat and rain, and had his tent attacked by a herd of cows, but his enduring memory will be of the amazing people he has met along the way. He added:




The amount of support I have received has been astounding. Not only from SSAFA and the military, but also from complete strangers who have contacted me through my webpage and offered me all sorts of help. I have even had complete strangers offer me a bed for the night, which is, I have to say, a lot more comfortable than a soaking-wet tent!




In another charity cycling adventure Royal Navy Air Station Culdrose-based aviator Lieutenant Edwin Cooper has this week completed a 1,000-mile (1,609km) cycling challenge, raising over £2,000 for Help for Heroes in the process.


Cycling from Falmouth all the way to Stromness Academy in the Orkney Islands, his childhood school, Lieutenant Cooper completed this feat in just seven days. He said:




From traversing the hilly counties of Cornwall and Devon, to dodging traffic in the central belt cities, to the tranquillity of cycling solo through the Scottish Highlands with herds of deer and sea eagles for company, the experience of cycling from Falmouth to Orkney unsupported, a 1,000 miles in seven days, for Help for Heroes, is a challenge I will never forget.




Although Lieutenant Cooper got to enjoy a couple of days’ rest and relaxation on the Orkney Islands, he did not get to put his feet up for long as soon after he was deployed as Flight Commander on board HMS St Albans.

Sailors used her small work boat Terra Nova to carefully navigate the ice field and land the scientists with equipment, food and fuel to last 30 days in one of the world’s bleakest locations.


While the scientists got to work, the weather and ice forecasts in the area began to worsen.


And so, after four days, the ship’s command decided to pull the scientists out much earlier than planned. A change of wind meant there was a chance ice from the nearby Weddell Sea would be driven towards James Ross Island and potentially block HMS Protector in - like a cork in a bottle.


Protector’s Commanding Officer, Captain Peter Sparkes, decided the safest and least risky option would be to sail through the increasing pack ice and send in the Terra Nova, the fast rescue craft Yelcho, and the inflatable boat Whiskey 1.


The scientists were collected with all their kit and were back aboard HMS Protector within 90 minutes of the first boat entering the water.


But now the ship had to fight her way out of the ice in the Erebus and Terror Gulf:




Then the daunting task of breaking out of James Ross Island and into open water where the ice density was not as thick began in earnest,” said Captain Sparkes.


With very careful navigation and a cool head, our ship’s company managed to break through some dense pack ice in the Erebus and Terror Gulf at night and into relatively safer waters.




Professor Mike Hambrey from Aberystwyth University, who’s working in Antarctica with the BAS, said he was grateful for the help and glad they had been able to do some research.


He said:




Unusually adverse ice conditions meant it had taken three attempts to get through to James Ross Island.


We are grateful to the crew of HMS Protector for their persistence in eventually finding a way through the ice and although this left us with only four days on the island we achieved a lot in that time.




Having experienced some extremely challenging ice-breaking conditions, Protector has resumed her survey work around the frozen continent.


The incident last week came shortly after sailors from HMS Protector fought a major fire at a research station which claimed the lives of two Brazilians.


Twenty-three sailors from Protector with firefighting equipment took over four hours to extinguish the blaze at Brazil’s Ferraz research station.


The Brazilian Government praised HMS Protector’s crew for their assistance in the incident and invited British representatives to the memorial service for the two casualties.

23,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secretary-unveils-blueprint-for-defence-reform,Defence Secretary unveils blueprint for Defence Reform,Last August the Defence Secretary commissioned Lord Levene to lead an independent and thorough review into how Defence is structured and managed…,news_story,2011-06-27T01:00:00+01:00,Ministry of Defence,"Last August the Defence Secretary commissioned Lord Levene to lead an independent and thorough review into how Defence is structured and managed.


The report by Lord Levene and a team of external experts has today been published in line with the principles for reform set out by the Secretary of State.


There are several recommendations within the report and Dr Fox has said he agrees with all of them. The key ones are:




extra powers for the Single Service Chiefs to run their Services, including increased control of equipment programmes and greater freedom to flex within their budgets, as part of a much clearer framework of accountability and control


a smaller but stronger and more strategic Defence Board that will take major decisions, set direction, and hold the Services and the rest of the Department to account


the creation of a new Joint Forces Command, with a new Military Commander, to oversee and integrate joint military capabilities which currently sit across the three Single Services - including cyber warfare and military intelligence - to foster an increasingly joint approach within Defence as a whole


a greater focus on affordability, with enhanced budgetary discipline and a cost-conscious mentality at every level of the Ministry of Defence


streamlined decision-making supported by a simpler structure with fewer senior posts, clearer responsibilities, and greater accountability


making better use of people, including filling posts with the right person, with the right skills, and keeping them in post for longer


new, more joint personnel management for senior military officers.




Dr Fox said:




Since becoming Defence Secretary, I have been determined to bring the way the MOD is run into the 21st century. The Department’s existing structure and lack of accountability contributed to the dire financial position we inherited.


We must take action to tackle the drivers of structural financial instability and the institutional lack of accountability endemic across Defence, dealing with the root of our problems as well as the problems themselves.


Lord Levene’s report will help us deliver this, beginning the most radical shake up the MOD has seen in a generation. Together with the Chief of the Defence Staff and Permanent Secretary, I will transform Lord Levene’s recommendations into meaningful change.




One of the key recommendations of the report is to empower the military, allowing Single Service Chiefs to take greater control of their own allocated budgets and advise on the best balance between manpower, training, equipment and support etc that are needed to deliver the Defence requirement.


This will ensure that they can drive capability planning. New oversight measures will ensure they will be properly held to account for so doing.


Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir David Richards, said:




I welcome Lord Levene’s recommendations to restructure the Armed Forces and align authority, accountability and responsibility.


The focus on strategic planning and operations and the restoration of control to the Service Chiefs will be vital to maintaining operational effectiveness as we implement the SDSR [Strategic Defence and Security Review] while fighting two wars.


The creation of the new Joint Forces Command will ensure we continue to develop close working relationships between the three Services and their integration with new capabilities such as cyber operations.




Lord Levene’s report, ‘Defence Reform - an independent report into the structure and management of the Ministry of Defence’, also recommends a review of all senior non-front line military and civilian posts to determine whether they are needed and, if so, whether they should be civilian or military.


Lord Levene said:




The financial crisis in Defence that the Government is tackling has been well-documented.


We looked into the underlying organisational causes of the crisis and found that the way Defence is structured and managed contributed to the loss of control over the budget, and needs to change.


As a result, many of the proposals in our report are designed to help prevent Defence from falling back into such a poor financial situation in the future. That is not a distraction from providing the military capability the country needs; it is essential to it.


Our Armed Forces are renowned across the world for their professionalism and expertise.


Our proposals aim to build on the strengths of the individual Services and the Civil Service but within a stronger single Defence framework to ensure the whole is more than the sum of its parts.


We found a real appetite for far-reaching reform among the many talented civilian and military people in Defence; it is now up to them to make it happen.




Work on the report commenced last summer when the Defence Secretary asked Lord Levene to lead an independent review of how Defence is structured and managed along with a group of senior leaders from the private sector and a supporting team within the Ministry of Defence.


The MOD will publish a blueprint setting out all the major changes the Department is embarked on later this year.

The 25-year-old, serving with the Tidworth-based 2nd Royal Tank Regiment, was amongst a crew of soldiers patrolling in one of the Army’s new Warthog armoured vehicles.


They were out on a routine security patrol, providing reassurance to local communities, when suddenly they were re-tasked to reinforce infantry colleagues who had been pinned down by fire from hidden insurgents and needed urgent back-up.

Lance Corporal Murfitt, from Barnstaple in Devon and known to Army mates as ‘Murf’, said:




It had been a pretty standard patrol, but when the call came in and we were re-tasked, we were told to get in there fast and provide support.






I was in the rear half of my Troop Sergeant’s vehicle ready to give precision fire with my rifle, and the driver stepped on it to get there as quickly as possible.






Our arrival, with our heavy firepower, seemed to bring the fight to an end fairly quickly, but we stayed alert.






Everything was quiet, but then I spotted three men with a child on a compound roof, about 300 yards to the front of the vehicles.






Suddenly two of the men moved off, leaving one man with the child - it was a girl, no more than 10-years-old. At this point I realised something was wrong - the man picked up a rifle and moved behind the child, taking aim at me.




LCpl Murfitt immediately told his commander that he could identify a possible insurgent who was using a child as a shield and taking aim at his vehicle.


He was faced by a dilemma: he could protect himself and engage the insurgent but, if he did that, he could not guarantee that the child would be unhurt. Making a split-second call, LCpl Murfitt took the decision to wait. He said:




I knew I could take him down but, being a dad myself, I didn’t want to run the risk of killing a kid and undoing all the good work we’ve achieved. So I waited, hoping that the child would drop down and give me a clear shot.




But then, as he was waiting for the moment to strike without putting the girl’s life at risk, the insurgent fired a single shot - it struck LCpl Murfitt on the left hand side of his helmet knocking him to the floor.


His advanced Mark 7 Combat Helmet, a piece of kit which has already saved so many lives in Helmand, took the force of the bullet. LCpl Murfitt was uninjured, but left on his back, on the floor of the vehicle, dazed and seeing stars. He explained:




I felt the dent in my helmet and said to the others, ‘I’ve been shot in the head but I’m fine’. I tried to stand up but I had ‘disco [wobbly] legs’ and just had to sit down again for a bit!




Despite being shaken, LCpl Murfitt kept his cool and managed to signal to the vehicle gunners where the shooter was. The child had run off as soon as the shot was fired, giving the troops the chance to strike without endangering the girl. LCpl Murfitt added:




As I sat back, and started to take in what had happened, I heard automatic fire as the Warthogs engaged the insurgent.




Following the incident, LCpl Murfitt was straight back out on patrol with his colleagues.


Lance Corporal Murfitt and his Tank Regiment comrades - known as Tankies - are specifically tasked with protecting infantry soldiers and engineers working on the development of a major road in central Helmand.


This task is critical to improving trade and general living conditions for the people in the area, but it is difficult and dangerous. There is a constant threat of attacks from insurgents, who view the road as a threat to their control over people’s lives.


LCpl Murfitt has already fought in Afghanistan with the Royal Tank Regiment once before; in 2007, when he was also a pioneer of a new vehicle, becoming one of the first soldiers to use the heavily armoured Mastiff.


He says that, while it’s tough in Helmand, the love and support from his family at home makes things tolerable. When his tour comes to an end next year, LCpl Murfitt looks forward to getting home to his family in Barnstaple.

The Prime Minister has decided to proclaim an additional bank holiday to mark the Coronation of His Majesty King Charles III next year.


The bank holiday will fall on Monday 8 May, following the Coronation on Saturday 6 May.


In line with the bank holiday to mark Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II’s Coronation in 1953, this will be an opportunity for families and communities across the country to come together to celebrate.


The bank holiday will take place across the United Kingdom.


Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said:


“The Coronation of a new monarch is a unique moment for our country. In recognition of this historic occasion, I am pleased to announce an additional bank holiday for the whole United Kingdom next year.”


“I look forward to seeing people come together to celebrate and pay tribute to King Charles III by taking part in local and national events across the country in his honour.”


Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Oliver Dowden said:


“The Coronation combines the sacred and the solemn but it is also celebratory.”


“This bank holiday will once again give people across the United Kingdom the opportunity to come together as families and communities to welcome His Majesty to the throne as we mark this important day in our nation’s long history.”

Within half-an-hour the flames were visible from…,news_story,2010-05-18T01:00:00+01:00,Ministry of Defence,"The fire broke out in a storage yard on the base at 1800hrs local time on Sunday 16 May 2010. Within half-an-hour the flames were visible from over a mile away at neighbouring Camp Bastion.


Camp Leatherneck is the American base near the UK’s main base in Helmand, Camp Bastion. See Related News to read more about Camp Bastion.


RAF fire crews were called in by their American colleagues to help tackle the huge blaze on Sunday but the weather fought against them, with a severe dust storm ripping into the camp and fanning the flames. It spread the fire across the whole of the storage yard.


The fire’s progress was so fast that an American fire engine, unable to vacate its path, was consumed by the flames.


After hours spent struggling against the blaze, the firefighters were forced to stand down for their own safety.


Corporal Jim McInally of the RAF Fire Service was part of the team who responded to the Americans’ call for assistance:




There was absolutely nothing we could do. We had to evacuate,” he said. “There was so much heavy machinery around, we didn’t know where the flames were coming from or where it was spreading to. The Force Fire Officer just wanted everybody to the side, [told them to] get out; safety was paramount.




It took nearly five hours before the fire was officially declared contained.


By morning the flames had considerably subsided, but small pockets of fire were still burning. Camp Leatherneck’s storage yard, the size of two football pitches, had been completely consumed.


In spite of the damage, no-one was injured in the fire, although one firefighter was treated for smoke inhalation and the Americans said operations were unaffected.


The cause of the fire is under investigation.


This report by British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) Camp Bastion-based reporter James Hirst was aired on the BFBS British Forces News channel on Monday 17 May 2010. See Related links to watch the full report online.

For the next six weeks, we want to hear how the way regulations relating to pubs are enforced can be improved, reduced or done differently.


Experiences with regulators might include:




dealing with paperwork


inspections


advice from regulators you come into contact with




The campaign allows comments to be posted anonymously.


Business and Enterprise Minister Mark Prisk said:


“Pubs are the beating heart of our communities. They are essential for people to relax and enjoy the company of their friends in villages, towns and cities all over the UK. But pubs are businesses too and, as enterprises, they can be held back by poor enforcement of regulation.


“Dealing with the way rules for pubs are enforced can sometimes be more of a problem than the red tape itself. That’s why I’m urging anyone involved in running a pub, particularly a community pub, to visit the Focus on Enforcement website and let us know your views so that we can consider and take any necessary action.


“We know there are examples of good practice too, so we also want you to tell us on the website about the people who give really good advice and support. This is your chance to make a real difference to the way regulations are enforced.”


The Focus on Enforcement website, for the first time, also provides details on national regulators in one place and on regulatory functions carried out by local authorities.

The Advisory Group’s Second-in-Command, Captain Ruaraidh Stewart, said:




This is one of the strongest operations we [the Advisory Group] have seen the Kandak plan and conduct.




He was quick to point out that there was no requirement for the 1 SCOTS Advisory Group to participate in either of the arrest operations. He said:




Our presence was purely for back-up, which was not needed.




Military intelligence indicated the insurgents were working for the lead Taliban insurgent co-ordinator in Sangin’s southern Green Zone area.


A number of potential locations were watched closely before the ANA launched the first, quickly planned, snatch operation. This decisive action enabled the ANA to capture three important figures without incident.


The second operation was a meticulously planned morning raid. At 0200hrs, with no light and no sound, the ANA surrounded a compound.


The insurgents were taken completely by surprise, unaware that they had been targeted.


While there was an ISAF search dog and members of the 1 SCOTS Advisory Group on location as back-up, there was no requirement for them to even enter the building. Captain Stewart said:




The ANA had the situation well under control on their own. This operation led to five insurgents being successfully arrested and detained.


This second arrest operation was authorised after an enormous IED had exploded in the northern Sangin wadi [riverbed], potentially endangering the lives of local nationals and the ANA.




The ANA soldiers from the 2-3-215 Kandak are under the command of Colonel Wadood who authorised the insurgents to be detained and arranged for their onward transportation to Shorabak, the headquarters of 215 ANA Corps. From there the detainees will be taken to Lashkar Gah for trial under the Afghan judicial system.


40 Commando Battle Group are based in Sangin to provide security to the region, mentor the Afghan National Police, partner the Afghan National Army and enable the continuation of reconstruction projects in the area.

Lieutenant Young’s job involves travelling out to the various locations around Helmand province and teaching classes of English and Maths for soldiers who need to gain qualifications in order to be promoted or as preparation for a life outside the forces. He said:




It’s a varied and unpredictable job. One day you can be teaching in a place with flatscreen TVs and its own cafe, the next you can be out in the desert, sweating buckets, trying to explain fractions and ratios.


It’s very rewarding, and it’s good to give soldiers, many of whom have little or no formal qualifications, the chance to improve themselves.


The unit I am currently supporting is split amongst several main bases in very different parts of Afghanistan, from the desert to the ‘Green Zone’. I travel between them in helicopters or on armoured convoys and set up a mini-classroom in each place.




As you might expect it’s not always that simple to be a teacher in a country like Afghanistan:




In some places there is insurgent activity every day, in others you could go out of the front gate in a T-shirt it’s so peaceful,” continued Lieutenant Young.


A few times we’ve had to abandon lessons to take cover as fire fights have broken out just beyond the base walls. However, whilst we are mindful of the danger, the guys who have been here before say it’s only a fraction of what it used to be.


The heat, which is unbearable at times, is the main problem. At one point the bunker where I was teaching reached 47 degrees Celsius. We had guys climbing into the turret of an armoured vehicle so that they could do their maths tests somewhere air-conditioned.




Speaking a little of the local Pashto language helps massively in bonding with the locals, and Lieutenant Young values having taken a course in it before deploying:




The Afghans are very similar to folks back home. They are kind and hospitable, with a tremendous sense of humour despite living through tough times. They like to talk as well, so if you start a conversation be prepared for the long haul.


My first experience of a ‘shura’ with the local elders was fascinating. Meeting these white-bearded men with huge turbans was surreal. They appreciated my attempt at speaking to them in their own language, even if my grammar is quite poor.


It is interesting to see them confront the challenges that they face in the future. Though it is peaceful in large areas of Helmand, ISAF troops are leaving by 2014, leaving local leaders in full control.


Making decisions here is a difficult process as they need to introduce changes without upsetting the local status quo - a tough job at the best of times in their very tribal culture.


I see a lot of parallels with Northern Ireland. Fifteen years ago people elsewhere would write off Northern Ireland, but, following the peace process, the place is completely transformed. I hope the Afghans get to enjoy the same benefits of peace in their country.

Sermons were delivered by Imam Asim, the Muslim Chaplain to the British Armed Forces, and also by the Imam of the local 205 Corps of the Afghan National Army (ANA), demonstrating the united relationship between ISAF and the ANA.


The sight of ISAF troops and the local community joining together to celebrate their faith offered some respite for the whole camp from the difficulties being faced in Afghanistan.


Eid ul Adha is one of two highly important Muslim festivals in the Islamic calendar. Imam Asim drew his sermon from Abraham’s teachings on loyalty and commitment to duties. The Imam asked those present to concentrate on these principles and draw strength from the teachings.


Imam Asim said:




This service provided an opportunity for ISAF to demonstrate respect for the Muslim faith by providing a service for all Muslims on the base. One young American pilot told me of the sense of unity he felt being able to pray with fellow Muslim soldiers from other countries and with local Afghans, in a celebration that counters the insurgent messages that ISAF are at war with Islam.






Being in theatre is obviously a demanding and taxing time for anyone who is deployed. A visit from a chaplain of your own faith, particularly on a demanding operational tour, can help with boosting the spirits of individuals.


The opportunity to pray and reflect on key issues while on operations can really help people put their lives, tasks and situations into perspective. The Eid service really brought home to me the commitment with which the British and coalition forces serve.




Imam Asim was appointed five years ago as the Muslim Chaplain to the British Armed Forces:




Joining the MOD as a chaplain I had little idea that within a few years I would be leading two Eid prayers at NATO’s largest military base on active operations in southern Afghanistan,” he said.


These events are minor miracles whilst at once being typical examples of the harmony in which Muslims and others live side-by-side in the UK and in the West generally.




This is the second Eid service Imam Asim has led in Kandahar this year, having conducted a service in September during a six-week trip.

The assault - completed in just a few hours - also saw the capture of three drug runners, 250 kilogrammes of heroin and a stash of weaponry, as well as important engagement and relationship-building with local residents.


Operation ZMARAY SARAK 5 - ‘Lion Road 5’ in English - was conceived, planned and executed by the Afghan National Police (ANP) under the leadership of Colonel Kamaluddin Sherzai, the district chief of police for Lashkar Gah.


Support was provided by The Royal Highland Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland (2 SCOTS), led by Commanding Officer Lieutenant Colonel Dougie Graham. The two commanders worked together closely throughout.


The operation was launched at dawn on Saturday. Attempts were made by insurgents to target the operation with numerous improvised explosive devices and an ambush, but the vigilance of the officers - combined with support from local people who warned the police where the IEDs were hidden - meant that they all failed.


Colonel Sherzai said:




This operation was a first for this area, with unprecedented co-operation between us in the ANP, the Afghan Border Police, the National Directorate of Security and the Afghan National Army. The support we received from ISAF, in the shape of the Royal Highland Fusiliers, was valuable but limited.


Our men have benefited from the most excellent training from the truly honourable and professional soldiers of the British Army but now we are rapidly getting to the stage where we can stand on our own feet and take over the security responsibilities that are rightly ours.




Colonel Graham added:




This operation provides a glimpse of the future: Afghan conceived, planned and led with cross-government support from the Afghans and minimal support from ISAF troops. An area that was previously under the control of the Taliban is now firmly in the sights of the local government.


There is more to do, and more operations of this type will be necessary to ensure that the population is protected from the insurgency. There is also much scope for infrastructure development. But the level of assistance that the locals gave the Afghan security forces and us, helping us to locate the insurgents and their IEDs, gives us all significant hope.

Using her sonar and underwater mine disposal system, Seafox, HMS Brocklesby successfully located and destroyed a buoyant mine just one mile (1.6km) from the entrance to the harbour.


The mine, containing more than 100 kilogrammes of high explosives, had been crudely placed by pro-Gaddafi forces using an inflatable dinghy to transport it out to sea.


Lieutenant Commander James Byron, Commanding Officer of HMS Brocklesby, said:




I am extremely pleased we have been able to dispose of ordnance in the approaches to Misurata that is now a vital lifeline for the delivery of humanitarian aid into Libya.


Our actions on behalf of NATO are directly contributing to the continued welfare of the Libyan people. In helping to keep the port of Misurata open we are ensuring the continued flow of essential medical assistance and allowing the evacuation of innocent civilians from the country.






This is exactly the kind of operation my crew have trained for, dealing with live mines posing a threat to legitimate shipping within sight and range of shore bombardment. My team have handled themselves superbly in the execution of this mission, reacting stoutly to the very real threat posed by rockets and artillery ashore.




Misurata is a critical port for the continued flow of humanitarian aid into Libya and for the evacuation of displaced persons to safety.


The Defence Secretary, Dr Liam Fox, said:




HMS Brocklesby is carrying out vital work to secure the waters off Misurata to allow humanitarian aid to reach the civilian population. This specialist capability is helping prevent Gaddafi forces from sealing off the port to deny medical and food supplies to the people of Misurata.




Within 24 hours of the reported laying of mines HMS Brocklesby and an allied ship were deployed to control the flow of traffic in and out of Misurata to protect shipping and conduct mine disposal operations. Both vessels disposed of mines to open the port for normal operations.


HMS Brocklesby is operating in support of Operations ELLAMY and UNIFIED PROTECTOR to enforce the arms embargo off Libya and protect Libyan civilians from continued violence.

A new Regional Command (South West), based in Helmand, will oversee Helmand and Nimruz provinces; while the existing Regional Command (South), headquartered in Kandahar, will continue to control ISAF forces in Kandahar, Daykundi, Uruzgan and Zabul provinces.


This change, which is based on the military advice of ISAF commanders on the ground, reflects a number of significant changes over recent months and was welcomed today by the Defence Secretary, Dr Liam Fox.


The recent changes on the ground include a large increase in the number of ISAF troops in southern Afghanistan - up from 35,000 in October 2009 to over 50,000 by this summer - and a greater complexity in the conduct of operations, with major ongoing security efforts in Kandahar and central Helmand.


The new command structure will also enable a better alignment with Afghan National Army units, with 205 Corps continuing to work with Regional Command (South) [RC(S)] and 215 Corps partnered with the new Regional Command (South West).


The decision to divide responsibility between the two headquarters will help provide the best focus of command support for ISAF forces across the region.


Secretary of State for Defence, Dr Liam Fox, said:




I welcome these changes to the command and control of our forces in Afghanistan which are based on sound military rationale and are in the interests of the overall coalition strategy and mission.






Through their sheer professionalism, bravery and sacrifice, British forces have made real progress in Helmand. They will continue to do so working alongside Afghan, American and other ISAF partners making up an international effort of more than 45 nations.




Major General Gordon Messenger, the Chief of the Defence Staff’s Strategic Communications Officer, said:




This command and control change makes complete sense and is welcome. The span and complexity of the command challenge in southern Afghanistan has increased enormously in recent months and these changes provide the best command support to the troops on the ground.






The change will also align the ISAF military structure in the south with the structure of the Afghan National Army, enabling a greater partnering capacity between ISAF and Afghan forces.






The UK has been closely involved in the preparations for this change and entirely agrees with its rationale. We are well accustomed to operating within a multinational coalition command structure and are entirely content that the best interests of the UK force will be maintained under the new arrangements.




Looking to the future, Regional Command (South West) will operate under a rotational command, agreed in principle to be shared between US and UK forces. The first commander will be Major General Richard Mills of the US Marine Corps (USMC).


As part of the new arrangements, command and control boundaries will change within Helmand province.


Following the split, Task Force Helmand (TFH) will come under the command of the US Marine Corps’ 1st Marine Expeditionary Force (1 MEF), under Major General Mills. TFH will retain responsibility for central Helmand.


Major General Richard Mills, Commanding General of 1st Marine Expeditionary Force (Forward), said:




Regional Command (South West) will ensure that ISAF and Afghan forces in Helmand and Nimruz provinces achieve the objectives of Operation MOSHTARAK, which are intended to assert the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan’s presence in the region.






Since taking command six weeks ago I have been hugely impressed by the momentum and achievements of RC(S) under General Carter.






My predecessors in the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade and the British troops of Task Force Helmand have distinguished themselves in the service of the Afghan people. Real progress is being made.




“This will be the first time that the USMC has led an ISAF Regional Command. The British officers in my coalition headquarters and Task Force Helmand bring invaluable experience and knowledge. We are partnered with ANSF [Afghan National Security Forces] at all levels and conducting joint operations throughout Helmand province.




While tough fighting remains, I see evidence daily of progress that will bring about lasting stability across southern Afghanistan.






This will be a significant year for the future of Afghanistan. Coalition forces, alongside our Afghan counterparts, will continue to support the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan as it delivers legitimate governance, improved security and lasting economic development.




Additionally, under the changes, the command of the 1,100-strong British Battle Group based in Sangin and Kajaki will transfer from Task Force Helmand to the US-led Regimental Combat Team (North), which is taking on responsibility for the north of the province.


In common with the other changes to ISAF’s command structures, this transfer of command will take effect on 1 June 2010 and is intended to optimise the command support available to the troops on the ground in light of the increased number of ISAF troops and other operational assets.


ISAF intends for Regional Command (South West) to become fully operational later this summer. In order to ease the transition, there will be an interim phase where 1 MEF will take responsibility for Helmand and Nimruz but will continue to work to Regional Command (South). This arrangement is planned to run from 1 June.


The UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Team in Helmand will work closely with the headquarters of Regional Command (South West) and will continue its vital role in delivering governance and socio-economic development in the province.


UK forces are committed to their enduring deployment to central Helmand and there are no plans to deploy UK forces from Helmand to anywhere else.

35,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/royal-navys-pete-reed-going-for-olympic-gold,Royal Navy's Pete Reed going for Olympic gold,Team GB rower Lieutenant Pete Reed is hoping to build on his Olympic gold from Beijing with a memorable win at home. Report by Lorraine McBride.,news_story,2012-07-26T01:00:00+01:00,Ministry of Defence,"

Do you mind if we sit down?” asks Lt Reed, glancing at his chunky sports watch.




“I need to be quick because I’m cold and hungry.”


He’s not being brusque, just keen to conserve energy for another gruelling rowing session at Caversham Lakes, near Reading.


Lt Reed is the 31-year-old Royal Naval officer who won gold at the Beijing Olympics four years ago in the men’s coxless four event.


Now he will be competing in his second Olympics; defending his medal alongside Alex Gregory, Andrew Triggs Hodge and Tom James. He insists anything less than gold would be a disaster:




It would be a nightmare to get a silver medal or less, so we just need to focus on being as good as we possibly can be, learning all our lessons over the last few years.




To become an Olympic gold medallist requires an uncommonly dedicated talent and mindset, and Lt Reed is convinced that officer training at the Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, shaped him into the Olympian he is today:




At Dartmouth, I learned about teamwork, determination, dedication, and enthusiasm - and those qualities are exactly what I’m using every day to get the job done,” he says.


I wasn’t the same guy before I joined the Navy that I became after training and I don’t think I could have done this sport for as long as I have if I hadn’t gone through Dartmouth.




Lt Reed joined the Navy for many reasons, but mainly the military lifestyle:




I didn’t want an office job - I wanted to be part of something that mattered more. That pointed me in the direction of the Royal Navy.




He was also drawn by the opportunity to train with the world’s best, and he won a Naval bursary before returning to the Fleet and serving as one of its youngest officers, training alongside wiser, older heads.


Taking part in the 2012 Olympics at Eton Dorney “is an opportunity to be part of history, to realise every sportsman’s dream,” he says, adding:




To win gold in a home Olympics would be spectacular.




And hopes for the men’s coxless four are high:




The expectation gives us the kick we need to deliver,” Lt Reed says.


There’ll be a lot of pressure. But that’s what you want when you’re going into battle.




He has little doubt that military support has helped him to reach the pinnacle of sport, and knows that his Navy payslip has provided a cushion that other, impoverished athletes don’t enjoy:




It keeps me living a lifestyle that isn’t extravagant, but a little bit ahead of some of my peers,” he says.






It means I can eat the right food, get the right rest and have the right quality of living, so that I can train harder than I would otherwise. And that has kept me at the top for a long time.


And having the Navy behind me, and their training, is absolutely synonymous with the personality and characteristics that you need to be a top rower.


I can’t quite find the words at the moment to describe how supportive the Navy has been. I wouldn’t be rowing if it wasn’t for the Navy. To have the Senior Service backing you when you’re training each day, and to be as proud as I am to be wearing the white ensign on my kit, spurs me on.






It’s something that will be with me as I cross the finishing line.

WO2 McFarlane said:




The stretcher-carry is an iconic image of the medics. The stretcher-bearers in the First and Second World Wars were the unsung heroes, proceeding into enemy fire to rescue the wounded. I’ve been in the Medical Regiment for 16 years and I’m passionate about providing the best care to personnel.






This was an excellent fitness challenge and it was very pleasing to see other units coming in to try and get the best time. I hope this now continues, and it would be nice to come out here in a couple of years and see the event still being run.






The charities chosen provide excellent care to those in need and we’re just pleased to be able to help them.




Camp Bastion hospital is widely regarded as one of the world’s leading centres for trauma care and recently took delivery of brand new state-of-the-art CT scanners and ventilators to give patients the highest possible level of care.

The 80 people who undertook the run were split into eight teams and completed 113 laps of the mile-long (1.6km) course with a stretcher weighing 110lbs (50kg), taking it in turns to carry the stretcher an hour at a time.


The challenge drew the attention of other units in Bastion, and soon there were several teams vying to get the fastest time.


The Royal Marines of 6 Troop, B Company, 40 Commando, were the first to take up the challenge, smashing the previous record of nine minutes nine seconds with an impressive six minutes 42 seconds, whilst wearing fancy dress!


However, not to be outdone, members of the headquarters squadron of 23 Engineer Regiment (Air Assault) took up the challenge and posted a time of six minutes 17 seconds.


The medics continued the challenge into the night, reaching the 100-mile (161km) mark at around 0400hrs. With the sun coming up, 40 Commando were determined to get their crown back and put in a sterling effort to complete the lap in six minutes 15 seconds, pipping the engineers by just two seconds.


The fastest time from the medics was an impressive seven minutes 52 seconds, completed in desert boots by the team from B Squadron.


It was left to the medics though to bring the stretcher home, and after their mammoth effort there were unsurprisingly a few tired faces. Yet the smiles from everyone were evidence enough that they had thoroughly enjoyed the challenge which they hope will now take place every six months with the rotation of UK forces.

Despite temperatures above 30 degrees, Al will run the course wearing his full body armour which weighs 13kg.


Quite a feat for anyone but especially for Major Jarvis as it comes just three years after he broke his back in a parachute accident. He also fractured his left hip and right ankle.


The 37-year-old was taking part in a training exercise in America but landed awkwardly, almost severing his spinal chord. He spent a week not being able to move at all but then doctors decided to operate to try and repair the damage.


Surgeons spent hours removing two shattered discs and inserting two metal rods and ten screws into Major Jarvis’ back. He was then flown back to the UK to continue his recovery but the outlook was far from hopeful.


He says it was a dark time:




They hoped that the surgery would strengthen my back enough to allow me to walk but I should be prepared to leave the Army because I would never be able to return to the fitness levels I had before the accident.




A keen sportsman, Major Jarvis joined the Army in 1997 and has served in Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Before his accident, he had completed nine marathons - including one in Lashkar Gah during a previous tour in Helmand.


With the support of his wife Alyssa, Major Jarvis went through months of intensive physiotherapy and treatment - defying doctors with his determination and resolve. He admits there were times it would have been easier to give up:




It was the hardest thing I’ve had to do - physically and mentally. But thinking I would never being able to play football with my children was enough to give me the energy I needed to do that little bit more.




Eventually, and against everyone’s expectations, Major Jarvis was assessed to be fit enough to return to his job as an engineer, based in Minley, Surrey. Last year, just under two years since his accident, he was told he would be deploying to Afghanistan.


Major Jarvis said that’s when he came up with the idea:




When I found out I was being posted back to theatre and would be in Lashkar Gah for the London Marathon, I set myself the goal of being fit enough to try and complete the distance. I did it once before but this time it would have much more significance and be a personal achievement for me.




In order to complete the marathon, Major Jarvis will have to run around the main operating base in Lashkar Gah, which is home to the headquarters of Task Force Helmand, at least twenty-six times which he admits will be tough:




The first few times should be ok,” he said, “but after that, as the temperature starts to rise and the pain starts to get stronger, I’m hoping a few of the guys will come and cheer me on and give me a bit of support.




Major Jarvis, who lives in Farnborough with his wife and two sons, Ben, who is eight, and Guy, who is five, is hoping to raise money for Combat Stress - a charity that helps veterans suffering from mental health problems.


Unlike many of the runners in London - who will be treated to a warm bath, slap up meal and glass of champagne - after his marathon on Sunday, Major Jarvis will go straight back to his job working in the Military Stabilisation Support Group in the Provincial Reconstruction Team.




I am so grateful to the medics who’ve helped me to get to a position where this is even possible that just completing the distance will be reward enough for me. I might be walking a bit slower for a few days after but it’s all for a worthy cause.




Major Jarvis returns to the UK in September and hopes to run next year’s London Marathon in London.

After monitoring the vessel through the night, at dawn, in a well planned operation, the pirates were forced to surrender by the overwhelming force posed by HMS Chatham, her Lynx helicopter and fast boats containing the ship’s Royal Marines detachment.


The Royal Marines team boarded the larger craft and found ten Somalis and a large amount of fuel on board; the suspected pirates had been observed throwing items, including their weapons and other piracy-related equipment, into the sea.


The two smaller attack boats were fitted with powerful outboard engines and again contained a considerable amount of fuel. These were separated from the larger craft by the Royal Marines team and HMS Chatham and her Lynx helicopter used their combined firepower to destroy the smaller craft, ensuring that the suspected pirates could not continue with their mission.


Disarmed and without the means to commit an act of piracy, the ten Somalis were left with only enough fuel in the larger vessel to return to Somalia.


Commander Simon Huntington, the Commanding Officer of HMS Chatham, said:




I am extremely pleased that we have again successfully disrupted a suspected pirate attack group operating in the Somali Basin and prevented them from mounting attacks against merchant shipping. This clearly demonstrates NATO’s determination and commitment to continue the fight against piracy in the region.

NATO has contributed to the international counter-piracy effort off the Horn of Africa since December 2008. The mission has expanded from escorting UN and World Food Progamme shipping under Operation ALLIED PROVIDER to protecting merchant traffic in the Gulf of Aden under Operation ALLIED PROTECTOR.


In addition to these activities, and as part of the latest mission, Operation OCEAN SHIELD, NATO is working with other international bodies to help develop capacity of countries in the region to tackle piracy on their own.


The NATO Task Force consists of five ships from Standing NATO Maritime Group 2. These are HMS Chatham (UK), USS Cole (US), TCG Gelibolu (Turkey), HS Limnos (Greece) and ITS Scirocco (Italy).


At sea, NATO is working closely with other partners including the EU Maritime Force and the Combined Maritime Force, as well as other navies including China, Japan, India and Russia.

After neutralising a US Mark 12 mine, the force finished off the exercise by disposing of a WW2 German mine, conducting a controlled explosion of the 70-year-old piece of ordnance.


Commander David Bence Royal Navy, who headed the Mine Warfare Battle Staff (MWBS) during Joint Warrior, said:




The Exercise has been a gratifying period of training for my staff, who have proved themselves ready for operational deployment abroad.




“Working with our international partners is of great benefit to all involved, and dealing with real ordnance alongside a well-developed, complex exercise scenario is always satisfying. It certainly underlines how cohesive and capable we are as a Mine Counter-Measures community.”


During the Second World War, Loch Ewe was used as a departure point for submarines working in the Atlantic, and as an assembly point for convoys heading to West Africa, North America and Russia.


“Port A”, as it was then known, would have been a valuable target for the enemy, and the Royal Navy used anti-submarine nets to protect its assets.

Some 600 soldiers who had completed their first tour received their medals at the parade at Colchester’s Merville Barracks, with Their Royal Highnesses presenting medals to around 120 soldiers each. Prince Charles said:




Once again, the Parachute Regiment has excelled in the dangerous and demanding environment of Afghanistan, and you have given hope to local people.






These achievements have come at a terrible cost and as you stand here it is only right that we pay tribute to the friends and colleagues who didn’t make it home. To the wounded, your courage and determination to overcome your injuries is utterly humbling.






The selfless service and commitment you have all given is unwavering and this country owes you all a very special debt of gratitude.




After the medal parade, Their Royal Highnesses presented Elizabeth Crosses and Memorial Scrolls to the families of 21 Paratroopers killed in Northern Ireland, the Falklands, Iraq and Afghanistan and met the families of soldiers killed and wounded on the recent tour.


The Paras served in Afghanistan on Op HERRICK 13 from October 2010 to May 2011. 2 and 3 PARA served as ground holding infantry battlegroups in the Nahr-e-Saraj (South) and Nad ‘Ali (North) areas respectively, while 4 PARA is the Parachute Regiment’s Territorial Army battalion.


Approximately 70 reservists were mobilised to serve alongside their regular counterparts.


Lieutenant Colonel James Coates, Commanding Officer of 3 PARA, said:




The parade is about welcoming the Regiment back from Afghanistan, and making a pledge to our wounded and bereaved families that we will support them through whatever they have to face.






This was 3 PARA’s third tour of Helmand in five years and we have seen genuine change. We pushed the insurgents out of our area of operations, helped further redevelopment and build confidence in local government.




Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Harrison, Commanding Officer of 2 PARA, said:




We took the campaign forward in Nahr-e Saraj (South) at a pace we could never have anticipated, which is testament to the quality of our soldiers. They went out on patrol every day, working to win the confidence of the local population as much as defeating the insurgents.






The presence of our Colonel-in-Chief at the medal parade means a huge amount to the Regiment.




The 2 PARA Battle Group was responsible for security in the Nahr-e Saraj (South) district, a rural area between Helmand Province’s administrative capital in Lashkar Gah and the economic centre of Gereshk.


Key achievements include establishing patrol bases in the former Taliban strongholds of Tor Ghai and Hadezai, clearing dozens of IEDs from Walizi and Char Coucha, opening seven schools and setting up a radio station to broadcast news, music and community updates to the district’s 37,000 residents.


The 3 PARA Battle Group was responsible for Nad ‘Ali (North), a 170 kilometre-square shoulder of irrigated farmland and desert between Nad ‘Ali and Babaji districts.


In an insurgent haven that had seen minimal enduring ISAF presence, the 3 PARA Battlegroup cleared and then consolidated six protected communities, breaking the insurgent stranglehold over the area.


3 PARA’s efforts enabled the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to finally reach the population, offering an alternative option to Taliban rule.


After yesterday’s medal parade at Merville Barracks, the soldiers and their families were fed by Kismet Kebabs, based in Latchingdon, Essex, who provided 2,000 free kebabs and also brought along a record-breaking 4,000 kg kebab.


Peter Micheal, Kismet Kebabs’ managing director, said:




My motivation in making the giant kebab was to do something spectacular to show our support to our troops, who put themselves at risk in all our names. The guys deserve all the praise and support we can give them and feeding them today is just a small gesture from my company.




The record-breaking kebab is two metres tall, took five days to assemble, and is so big that it has proved impossible to cook it. Mr Micheal said:




The Army looked at ways to cook it and decided that it couldn’t be done, and if these guys can’t do it no-one can! Instead we set up a kitchen at the barracks and cooked 2,000 kebabs fresh for free, and would happily do the same again to show my support for the Army.




Captain Kevin Finch, who is in charge of logistics at Colchester Garrison, said:




We are very grateful to Kismet Kebabs for their generous support to Colchester Garrison and The Parachute Regiment’s medal parade. It is a great boost to morale to know that we have the support of local businesses.

Lance Corporal Brown, a member of the Royal Mercian and Lancastrian Yeomanry (RMLY) - a Territorial Army regiment whose history dates back to 1794 - was in a tent using a computer to send emails to his family when the roof landed on him causing devastating injuries.


Just weeks from the end of his first tour of Afghanistan he found himself being airlifted to Camp Bastion hospital with three broken bones in his lower spine.


It was only half-way through his laborious recovery back in the UK that it dawned on him he might not be able to return to his former employment as a specialist armourer, reproducing medieval armour pieces for private collections and museums around the world:




I was self-employed, making armour for everything from theatre productions to replicas for use in the national armouries,” he said.


It was quite hard physical work and, when I started trying to walk again, the smallest movement was such a huge effort I quickly realised that going back to work may never be possible.


I panicked a bit to be honest. I didn’t deal with it very well; there was a lot of disappointment and a total loss of confidence.

It was at that point that the Army welfare team began working to get Lance Corporal Brown into the ‘Return to Work Initiative’ - a programme run by the Ministry of Defence to help find meaningful employment for Service personnel in a period of recovery following illness or injury.


In April 2010 Lance Corporal Brown became the first reservist to benefit from the scheme when he arrived for his first day of a very fitting placement at the Royal Armouries Museum at Clarence Dock in Leeds.


The father of one took part in a vital project helping the staff of the museum to audit the national collection - an assortment which includes items that Lance Corporal Brown made himself prior to his deployment.


He admits that it has been a bit of a culture shock:




I’ve never done any type of office work before and I would never have thought of doing something like this so I’m learning a lot. But doing it in an environment where I’m surrounded by items that I know about makes it easier.


It’s great that this placement came up when it did. It’s good to have something to focus on while you recover fully.


When I leave this placement I’ll have to find full-time work and this has been so enjoyable I would definitely look at something similar for the future.


Maintaining the register fits my perfectionist ideals; it’s a challenge to get everything right. And it’s guns and armour - big boys’ toys - how can you not enjoy that?




Lance Corporal Brown’s boss at the Royal Armouries Museum, 29-year-old Kathy Richmond, says that he has been a real asset:




The knowledge that he has brought to the project has been completely invaluable. We’ll miss him when he leaves us. People like David don’t just grow on trees!




Lance Corporal Brown completes his placement today, 15 July 2010, but remains a member of the RMLY and continues to receive treatment through the rehabilitation and recovery programme at the Reserves Training and Mobilisation Centre.


He is characteristically upbeat about his experience:




Obviously it would have been better if I’d come back without injury but I don’t regret the tour itself and, if I was put back in the same position now, I would make the same decision to go.


We had a really good tour, we achieved a lot. I can honestly say I have no regrets.

On arrival at Clarence House, the servicemen women were each presented with Afghanistan Operational Service Medals by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales.


Lieutenant Jonathan Crawford, a Mobile Air Operations Team leader, explained:




Today has been a fantastic occasion. Marching down the Mall in front of cheering and appreciative crowds was a wonderful feeling, and to be then presented with my Operational medal by Prince Charles in the garden of Clarence House, with my partner looking on, was an extremely proud moment; something I will remember forever.






Prince Charles was really interested in my experiences in [Afghanistan], and I told him that, as part of a CHF unit, I lead a small four-man team that is part of a ground troop which selects helicopter landing sites and coordinates the extraction of ground troops by helicopter.

Chief Petty Officer Colin Harvey, an aircraft engineer on 845 Naval Air Squadron, was also asked about his experience in Afghanistan:




Being in charge of a large number of sailors is quite a responsibility. But we all feel a great sense of pride and achievement knowing that our efforts were keeping the aircraft serviceable 24-7,” he said.






A normal day at work ranged from basic flight servicing and daily maintenance tasks, to big jobs such as double engine changes. The aircraft required considerable care due to the harsh environmental conditions and occasional bullet holes from enemy ground fire. However I was more nervous about marching down the Mall than being in Afghanistan.




This will not be the end of operations in Afghanistan for the CHF; a small contingent of Sea King helicopters remains in the country, and will be followed in the New Year by the Lynx aircraft of 847 Naval Air Squadron.


The Commanding Officer CHF, Captain Matt Briers RN, said:




Today has been a tremendous occasion for all CHF personnel and especially their families, some of which have travelled from as far as Ireland and the north of Scotland.






To see the pride and emotion in their eyes as their loved ones received their medals was very emotional. His Royal Highness has taken a great interest in what we have achieved in Afghanistan and was keen to speak to both Service personnel and their families.

The changes will better reflect circumstances on the ground and the earlier division of Regional Command (South) into two separate commands.


Dr Fox said that the elements of the UK Theatre Reserve Battalion, currently provided by 2nd Battalion The Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment, will deploy temporarily at the request of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to central Helmand province in mid-July to underwrite recent gains in the area.


Dr Fox said that these additional forces, numbering 300 in total, will give commanders additional flexibility over the summer to reinforce progress in central Helmand.


This deployment, he continued, will be a precursor to the next stage in the phased reorganisation of international forces across the newly-created Regional Command (South West), reflecting the deployment of more than 18,000 additional ISAF troops to the province over the past 18 months.


The Theatre Reserve Battalion will deploy until the UK battlegroup, currently in Sangin, is redeployed into central Helmand. This will occur later in the year when the US takes over security responsibility for Sangin.


The Chief of the Defence Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, said:




The temporary deployment of the Theatre Reserve Battalion will allow ISAF to build on the significant progress we have already made in central Helmand and to drive home improvements in security, governance and infrastructure.






These forces are also an essential precursor for the next stage of the reorganisation of ISAF forces in Helmand in which we will hand responsibility for Sangin to our American counterparts.






This reorganisation makes very sound military sense and ensures that UK troops are deployed in the most effective way alongside ISAF and Afghan forces.






Our Service personnel can rightly be enormously proud of the work they have done in Sangin and the significant progress that they have achieved there.






Sangin is a challenging area of Afghanistan and we leave it a better place. The experience our troops have gained there will be vital in the work they will continue in the important population centres of central Helmand.




The changes in Sangin are able to be made because ISAF intends to restructure its forces in Farah and Nimruz provinces and in northern Helmand so that it can consolidate a US Marine brigade in the Upper Helmand Valley which will assume responsibility for security in Sangin later this year.


This in turn will enable UK troops to be redeployed to reinforce progress in the key districts of central Helmand, allowing those deployed as part of our Theatre Reserve Battalion to withdraw.


ISAF’s plan will tidy up the current arrangement where British forces in Sangin come under US command. The result will be a coherent and equitable division of three brigade-sized contributions, with the US in the north and south, and the UK-led Task Force Helmand, with our Danish and Estonian allies, in the central population belt.


During his statement to Parliament today Dr Fox said:




In Sangin, UK forces have made huge progress in the face of great adversity and we take pride in our achievements there. The district centre has been transformed. Central Helmand is a safer place as a result of our endeavours and sacrifices.




“On the ground, we continue to make progress. There will be hard days ahead, but the further changes I have announced today mean more manpower and greater focus for the key battleground of central Helmand.




We have the right strategy and we are determined to see it through.

Members of all three British Services stationed at the base take time out to teach the boys in arts and crafts and maths and English before their formal lessons begin with the Afghan teacher, Mr Abdul Raziq.


Every Saturday sees a stream of local traders coming through the main gate of Kandahar Airfield to set up a bazaar selling a wide range of goods to almost 20,000 personnel from the 42 nations serving at the sprawling ISAF base.


Many of the traders bring their sons and nephews, and a Dutch Warrant Officer, browsing the stalls around 18 months ago, noticed that the youngsters didn’t have a lot to occupy their time.


He hit upon the idea of setting up a school in an area to one side of the stalls where the children could have formal lessons and a little bit of fun.


School volunteer Andy Carnegie commented:




The KAF Bazaar School is an opportunity for the military population in KAF to interact with local nationals.


The school is a Saturday morning activity school … It gives the chance for the soldiers to interact with local nationals and for the boys to interact with the military.

We have 45 students who are separated into three crews - the seniors, juniors and the brand new ones.






First of all I teach them Pashtu. It is really important for them to learn Pashtu.


Then they learn the ABC, which they can study through English books, and study the English language. They are doing homework, learning and writing the ABCs.




To celebrate Armed Forces Day, a recent session at the school was extended slightly and finished with a sports session and a special football match between the ‘bazaar school boys’ and British forces.


Unfortunately, the British took their cue from the English national team and lost 3-2.


Lance Corporal Gemma Highsmith, 8 Regiment Royal Logistic Corps, said:




This morning we’ve been doing a lot of arts of crafts with the children, talking to them, teaching them how to play noughts and crosses, and getting to know the kids.




Corporal Mitch Aldred, KAF Physical Training Instructor (PTI), continued:




Today I’ve come along as the PTI. I’m going to be trying to referee a football match between the boys, which should be pretty fun.


For those that don’t want to play football, there is going to be a game of frisbee.




After a hard few hours of studying, the chance for a sports hour is a welcome break for the boys.


One of the students commented:




We won the football… it was 3-2. I scored two goals. I like football.

After a warm-up session organised by Physical Training Instructors, the ‘racers’ collected at the start ready for the off.


The nature of the event meant that all the participants had to wear something pink and running attire ranged from sports kit to full body armour - a group of Americans even wore T-shirts with bras over them.


Cheered on by a crowd of spectators, and encouraged throughout by the rousing music of the Band of the Corps of Royal Engineers, they set off for 12 laps of the race route.


For the next hour, participants ran, walked and, in one case, ran as a three-legged pair, around the course to raise over £1,300 for cancer research.


The event was organised by Senior Aircraftwoman Lauren Bird, who has taken part in the Race for Life for the last seven years and was keen not to miss out just because she was on duty in Afghanistan.


Although Race for Life is a women-only event in the UK, SAC Bird found that many of her male colleagues wanted to show their support to their mums, sisters, wives and girlfriends taking part in the official runs around Britain, and decided that including men in this event was an excellent way for them to do so.


SAC Bird, who has lost several people to whom she was close to cancer, including her godmother, who lost her fight against cancer the day that SAC Bird travelled from the UK to Afghanistan, felt that this was a great way for Service personnel to help fund cancer research:




This is a cause that is dear to my heart and it was fantastic to see so many people turn up in their pink T-shirts to show their support,” she said. “To raise this much was amazing and was much more than I expected when I came up with the idea.




Group Captain Andy Linstead, Officer Commanding 904 Expeditionary Air Wing, also took part in the run. He said:




It’s wonderful to see that, even when working hard on ops, our people willingly give up their spare time for such a worthy cause.

He added that the operation has shown the utility of high-tech platforms such as Typhoon, and high-precision weaponry such as Brimstone.


On Defence as a whole, Mr Hammond said that the Ministry of Defence is one of the most important departments of government, and also one of the most complex and challenging:




But I know I will be working with the bravest, most selfless and professional people the country has to offer - the men and women of our Armed Forces,” he said.


And they are supported by some of the most dedicated people in the public service, the most highly skilled workforces in British industry and some of the most committed people in the charitable sector.




He added that his first engagement as Defence Secretary at Royal Wootton Bassett reinforced just how important the Armed Forces are to the public and just how important the support of the public is to the Armed Forces.


On the wider defence environment the Defence Secretary said that this is a difficult time for the country, and for Defence in particular:




We are dealing with the toughest economic climate in a generation and the biggest budget deficit in our peacetime history. Against that backdrop, in Defence, we have also to deal with the legacy of an unaffordable equipment programme and a decade of operations at a continuously high tempo.


We do so at a time when the threats to our national security and our national interests are evolving fast - and by no means diminishing. And at a time when our Armed Forces, including a substantial number of reservists, remain engaged in a dangerous and enduring mission in Afghanistan.




Mr Hammond described the mission in Afghanistan as a vital operation to protect our national security and said he would make it a priority to get out to theatre to visit the troops as soon as possible.


He said that the first focus of Defence must be the delivery of success on operations:




The projection of military power is, after all, the raison d’etre of the Armed Forces and the MOD; everything else is a supporting role.




The Defence Secretary said that it was his firm belief that when the Government asks the men and women of the Armed Forces to put themselves in danger in pursuit of national security, the Government owes it to them to make sure they are properly supported and have the best tools we can give them to do the job:




In Defence, we now have a clear programme to deliver on this pledge,” he said.


The Armed Forces that will emerge from the implementation of the Strategic Defence and Security Review will be formidable, flexible and adaptable, structured to defend the country and project power abroad, equipped with some of the best and most advanced technology in the world.


This is not a vision of retrenchment, it is an ambitious programme of renewal after a decade of continuous operations - a blueprint for a sustainable future as one of the world’s most capable fighting forces.




Speaking about the anniversary of the publication of the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR), Mr Hammond acknowledged that it had been a year of difficult decisions, but outlined what his approach to competing demands would be:




I am determined that we neither compromise current operations nor constrain future defence capability, that we do not remove critical skills and capabilities that are irrecoverable, and that we retain the ability to scale up in the future if our national security demands it,” he said.


I intend to be a strong and passionate advocate for our Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defence both within government and with the public. I will advance the interests of Defence and national security at every opportunity.




However, Mr Hammond said that first class Armed Forces depended on a first class economy and there is no future for a big military supported by a small economy:




History is littered with examples showing that to be a fast track way to a collapse in global influence and military capability,” he said.




He said that Future Force 2020, the reshaping of the Armed Forces, must be built on firm foundations with a force structure that is fit for the challenges of future warfare and the real-world risks we are likely to face.


Adding that it must be a defence programme that is affordable now and sustainable into the future:




Unpicking the SDSR piece by piece is simply not an option. The transformation programme is essential to balance our books and modernise our organisation.


I am clear that this is the only way to ensure success on operations and the continued ability to project military power.




Mr Hammond concluded by reaffirming his belief that the men and women of the Armed Forces are the greatest asset Defence has and that, during his tenure in office, the commitment to rebuild the Armed Forces Covenant will continue:




This will mean all of us working together - Government at all levels working together with charities and the private sector - to look after our serving personnel and their families, and our veterans.




He said that there remains a big challenge ahead but the Armed Forces deserve no less than success.

Flight Lieutenant Ben Mark, part of II (Army Co-operation) Squadron, normally based at RAF Marham in Norfolk, arrived in Afghanistan at the beginning of June. He explained his role in Afghanistan and the missions he has already undertaken:




Our primary role is to fly in support of coalition land forces.






Today’s task was just over three hours in the air, providing over watch for some British troops setting up a forward operating base.






My job was to observe what was going on around them, to keep an eye on them and offer help if they needed it. From our height we are able to see the bigger picture of what is happening on the ground.




However, the previous day’s mission was a much hotter affair:




A Forward Air Controller (FAC) out on patrol with United States troops asked for fast air support,” Flt Lt Mark said.






We were tasked as the nearest available jet, so he talked us to his position, giving us his location and telling us what was going on around him.






We could hear the bullets being fired and the nerves in his voice as he asked for our help.




As in this incident, almost all of the communication a Tornado crew will have is with a Forward Air Controller.


They could be any of nationality, and are usually Army personnel who will have a good understanding of what air support can offer.


Getting the jet to where it needs to be is the job of navigator Martin Cutting, who said:




Although we are armed when we fly, deploying bombs from the aircraft is always a last resort - we often carry out what is called a ‘show of force’.






Flying low and fast lets potential enemy forces know we are there, it’s the noise we create that makes the difference. We can often deter the enemy from taking further action against our troops on the ground.

Flying alongside experienced personnel like Flt Lt Mark are crews on their first operational detachment such as Flight Lieutenants Chris Jenkins and Jamie Newton who have been on II (AC) Squadron for just a few months.


Flt Lt Newton is a navigator. After his first Close Air Support mission in Afghanistan a few days ago he said:




You overcome your nerves and use the adrenalin to stay focused.






We were called to help check an area was clear of suspected enemy forces - we then had feedback from the guys on the ground that what we did was of great help - that gives me a real sense of achievement.




Pilot Flt Lt Jenkins added:




It’s been a real eye opener coming out here, there is so much more to what we do than you see in the news. We’ve been too busy to feel nervous, and it’s great to be able to work with the coalition forces.

UK Trade & Investment is hosting a global sports conference in London (30-31 January) to help UK companies find out about forthcoming mega sporting events and the multi-billion pound opportunities they represent. More than 250 companies have registered to attend the conference.


Trade and Investment Minister Lord Green said:




The London 2012 Games showed the world what Britain can do – and it showed Britain at its best. British businesses have seen their work showcased around the world. Admiration and respect for UK knowhow, innovation, and capability to deliver major projects and events is high and the UK has to take advantage of this window of opportunity.






Sporting events come around so regularly - irrespective of what happens to the global economy – which means that sport provides great opportunities for UK business. With the help of the UKTI, UK firms are already picking up business for these events and will continue to do so.




Contracts worth an estimated £1.5 billion have been identified flowing from the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2016 Rio Olympic and Paralympic Games which UK companies can, and have been, bidding on.


Delegates attending the conference were also able to see a preview of the upcoming short film ‘Great Britain Delivers’. The film showcases the London 2012 story which forms part of a wider marketing toolkit that UKTI is developing to help demonstrate the work that UK companies played in delivering the Olympics. The toolkit will be used by UKTI to present to future global sports hosts and others, taking the message to the world that the UK can deliver major global projects - on time and on budget.


Notes to editors:




The Global Sports Conference is being held at the Department for Business, Innovation & Skills from 30-31 January.


UKTI Commercial Officers from the host countries and cities hosting the next six mega sports events will also be attending the conference offering expert advice on how to access the opportunities these tournaments present.


PricewaterhouseCoopers estimate global sporting events will grow to £92 billion (‘Changing the Game’ report, 2011)


UKTI has already been involved in more than 160 trade missions to highlight the sports infrastructure and event management market. These include the Soccerex Global Convention in Rio and the Aspire4Sport conference in Doha. Activities planned for 2013 include a mission to Ankara and Istanbul in March following Turkey’s bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics, followed by trade missions to Brazil, Russia, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taipei.


A series of inward missions to give overseas firms and stakeholders the opportunity to visit our global sports venues and share best practice.


The government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries’. It set four ambitions in the 
‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB)
, published at Budget 2011:
 * To create the most competitive tax system in the G20
 * To make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business
 * To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy
 * To create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe


Work is underway across Government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the Government wants the economy to travel.


UK Trade & Investment (UKTI) is the Government Department that helps UK-based companies succeed in the global economy. We also help overseas companies bring their high quality investment to the UK’s economy – acknowledged as Europe’s best place from which to succeed in global business. UKTI offers expertise and contacts through its extensive network of specialists in the UK, and in British embassies and other diplomatic offices around the world. We provide companies with the tools they require to be competitive on the world stage. For more information on UKTI, visit

Major General Carter said that ISAF forces have created a strong security presence throughout Marjah, in the south of Helmand, as well as building security in the district centre.


However, he advised that there is still progress to be made in achieving Operation MOSHTARAK’s objectives to assert the Afghan Government’s authority in the region.


He said that while security in the district centre of Marjah is positive, the District Governor has not yet been able to reach out to all parts of Marjah. He said the insurgency is still present in the outlying areas of the region where intimidation means the population is too frightened to come forward with elders for shuras and indeed move freely into the district centre.


However, Major General Carter was optimistic that the local people would soon realise that ISAF forces are there to help, saying:




My guess is it will take another 90 days or so before the population will begin to realise that the security presence is there to stay and that it is in their interests to be with their government rather than the insurgency.


I would judge success on the extent to which the queue of locals outside the District Governor’s district centre increases, and at the moment there are 200 people a day, and what we’re looking for is for people to come from all parts of Marjah to have their issues dealt with.




Another sign that the local population has yet to rally against the insurgency is that, of 1,000 water pumps that are available, only 86 have been taken up by the local community.


Major General Carter believes that when the one thousand pumps have been distributed, he can be sure that intimidation has been eradicated, but that it will take a while to come.


ISAF forces moved into Nad ‘Ali 15 months before Op MOSHTARAK began and, judging by the progress which has already been made there, Major General Carter believes that it can be used as a benchmark for the success expected to come in Marjah.


Major General Carter said:




In Nad ‘Ali, the find-to-strike ratio of IEDs is very low, on the basis of six found to every one that strikes. There have been only nine IED incidents since we launched Operation MOSHTARAK back on the 13th of February - only nine.


When you consider that the Grenadier Guards Battle Group in Nad ‘Ali before Christmas was confronting around 40 direct fire incidents every week, we have less than five-a-week since MOSHTARAK was mounted in Nad ‘Ali as a whole.




Another sign of the success in Nad ‘Ali came on Tuesday this week when over 600 community elders travelled into the district centre to cast their votes in a secret ballot at the District Governor’s compound to decide the 45 members of the Nad ‘Ali District Community Council.


This year’s pre-election shuras, held throughout the Nad ‘Ali district, were attended by approximately 3,600 local people. 
See Related News.


Major General Carter said:




The population now has a stake in its community and it is now prepared to refute the insurgency in a way which has not been the case elsewhere in the northern and southern province.




Another mark of success in Nad ‘Ali is that Governor Mangal can now confidently move around the area without helicopters or support from the coalition, which he was unable to do four months ago.


Major General Carter added:




There’s still a good deal of work to do, but the trends are positive and my sense is that we’re in a good place in terms of the resources available on the ground and the way in which things are progressing.

But a Personnel Recovery and Assessment Centre is showing how technological advancements can also enhance troops’ fortunes far away from the battlefield.


Tedworth House in Wiltshire has been open to servicemen and women for six months and already its state-of-the-art surroundings have helped to change 150 young lives.


On a recent visit to the Help-for-Heroes-funded facility, the charity’s co-founder Bryn Parry explained how its success working with sick and injured personnel was in no small part down to the varied array of gizmos behind its doors:




Most people that come here go ‘wow’ and all the time it is technology backing us up,” he explained. “We now have the most sophisticated structure in the area.




Inside the Tidworth-based listed building some 6,300 miles (10,000km) of IT cabling can be found.


Among the televisions, DVD players and music systems common to most residential centres, this extensive network also serves a computer suite, extensive Wi-Fi access, a gaming area and an array of fitness equipment adapted for use by those with various disabilities.




Ex-soldier Dan O'Callaghan regularly works out on the centre's specialist gym equipment  [Picture: Steve Dock, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]


Later this year the £20m facility will open one of the most sophisticated gym complexes in the UK - the Phoenix Centre.


Kit there will include a £120,000 Skiplex indoor simulated ski slope, the second of its type in the country, and a SwimEx resistance pool.


Existing gear, such as the zero-gravity treadmill, will also be moved to the new room to improve residents’ confidence in adapting to their injuries.


Martin Colclough oversees the Phoenix programme which supports Battle Back, the MOD’s adaptive sports and adventurous training initiative:




[Our work] is about capitalising on technological advances to get the best benefit,” he explained. “We have bespoke, specialist equipment and although we started out with quite a small area for strength and conditioning we now need to space out.






Unlike the adaptive kit used at Headley Court, this is about preparing our troops to use the gear they will find back in civvy life.




With the imminent opening of the west wing later this year, Tedworth House will be at full operating capacity and able to accommodate a total of 54 residents.


Rifleman Billy Brumfield of 4th Battalion The Rifles was one of those who moved in last year:




I started doing courses and getting fit in the gym and it’s amazing,” he said. “The Phoenix Centre will be great too. There is nothing I am having trouble with that this place can’t help. You name it, they have covered it.




Other well-thought-out technology at the House includes panic alarms, cash-free food and drink top-up cards that can locate residents in an emergency, and a store of laptops and cameras that personnel can borrow to gain new skills in IT or photography.


Skype and video conferencing facilities allow guests to keep in touch with friends and family during their time away from home and Bluetooth-enabled laptops mean deaf visitors can follow a course instructor’s words in text on their computer screens.


Lance Corporal Colin Stephenson of the Intelligence Corps, who was injured by an IED in Afghanistan last year, said Tedworth’s technology was ‘opening doors’ for him and other servicemen and women:




I would definitely recommend that people come and give this place a go and arrive with an open mind,” he explained. “It builds confidence.




While the centre’s exciting facilities are helping troops to become more self-assured in living with their injuries and gaining new skills, camaraderie is often the most uplifting experience of a stay there.


The Officer Commanding, Major Peter Smith, explained:




One of the things we have learnt during our first six months is that sometimes the guys just want to sit and talk and get things off their chest.




And with state-of-the-art surroundings likely to impress technology-crazy British soldiers of any rank, this centre’s ambition to improve the lives of all who come through its doors is already being realised.

The RAF’s strategic air transport hub in the Middle East is currently a hive of activity due to the Royal Marines from 3 Commando Brigade taking over from the soldiers from 16 Air Assault Brigade in Afghanistan who have completed their six-month tour of duty.


But an offer of help from the Australian Defence Force to use one of its massive C-17 Globemaster aircraft meant that much-needed specialist vehicles, two Wolfhounds and an armoured repair vehicle were flown in too.


Squadron Leader Mark Clulo, Officer Commanding B Flight, 901 Expeditionary Air Wing, said:




The sheer size and weight of each Wolfhound vehicle means the only aircraft capable of moving them is the Royal Air Force’s, or in this case, the Royal Australian Air Force’s C-17.






This generous offer of assistance from the Australian Government gave us a fantastic opportunity to push these vehicles onto the front line ahead of schedule.






The close working relationships we have forged with our Australian counterparts has brought real benefits to this project and future missions.




Although both Air Forces operate the same C-17 aircraft, it is not just as simple as driving the vehicle onto the aircraft and then strapping it down.


Meticulous planning is required to ensure that the load is evenly distributed to keep the aircraft in balance. This required close liaison between the UK and Australian load teams to ensure that proven UK procedures could apply to the Australian aircraft.


Major Lara Bullpitt-Troy, Officer Commanding the Joint Movements Coordination Centre - Middle East Area of Operations, from the Australian Joint Task Force 633, commented:




The opportunity to increase our interoperability has enabled us to enhance the positive relationship we have with the Royal Air Force.




Squadron Leader Clulo added:




The support we have received from both the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force throughout this period has been fantastic.






Working together, we have overcome some significant obstacles to hopefully provide tangible benefits for troops on the ground in Afghanistan.






We have also shared perspectives, along with some merciless sports banter, and paved the way for closer integration in the future.

When they got underway, Tarik Company immediately deployed to the rifle ranges in Folkestone where the Officer Commanding, Major Juri Williamson, was keen to make up for lost time


The ranges, run by the training cell under Warrant Officer Class 2 (WO2) James Gracia and his training team, consisted of both static and moving targets designed to test the troops in all applications of firing, and from individual to group-sized practices.


The exercises tested the personal drills of each individual as well as the command and control of the platoon when under pressure. The men of Tarik Company soon found themselves firing at all manner of targets, running from cover to cover on individual battle ranges, fighting in sections of eight in the attack, and as a platoon of nearly 30, from purpose-designed buildings much like the forward operating bases used in Afghanistan. WO2 Gracia said:




The aim is not only to test the troops but, within safety limits, to create as much realism in the training as possible. There was a lot of hard work put in from the men trying to gain as much as possible from the ranges and making up for lost time.






This year, for the first time, we introduced simulation ammunition. Nothing has ever given our training this level of realism, allowing the troops the ability to see how their skills, drills and tactics work against a real enemy, where both sides are capable of shooting each other.




After ten days of intensive firing in Lydd and Hythe ranges, Tarik Company moved to South Wales for phase two of the exercise. Back in the home of infantry training, the RG troops practised their platoon and company level attacks.


As the RG’s Regular soldiers left Folkestone, the regiment’s TA troops arrived: “We are fortunate to be here,” said the Officer Commanding B Company, Major Tito Danino. “This training is not only mandated but imperative, and without it the company’s quality line would not be the same.”


B Company made full use of their exercise, covering all aspects from fieldcraft to platoon-sized live fire attacks over their two-week deployment.


With many fresh faces amongst the young Private Soldiers, this deployment was a new and exhilarating experience for many of the men. For some it was, without doubt, a shock to the system compared to some of their day-to-day jobs back in Gibraltar.


The final element of the training programme for Tarik Company involved a Final Test Exercise (FTX), which allowed the troops to stretch their legs over the training area, and the commanders to practise and test the platoons’ standard operational procedures and tactical mechanics.


The FTX was tailor-made to achieve the goals of the Officer Commanding and it gave the platoon commanders the time and space to test and develop their own skills. Sergeant Dellipiani, from 2 Platoon, said:




It was just right. It had all the aspects that put the company under pressure from the start, from fighting in built-up areas to company advance to contacts. We fought constantly for three days straight, as the enemy was relentless. This gave the FTX battle tempo a very realistic feel.




With the successful UK deployment now behind them, the RG soldiers can look forward to Exercise Jebel Sahara, an overseas exercise in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, where they will be able to build on their progress in field firing, and practise in a very different operating environment:




It is not often we get the opportunity to deploy to the UK. This training is essential for our infantry soldiers and it’s of paramount importance if we expect to undertake external operations, and for the security of Gibraltar.

Report by Lorraine McBride.,news_story,2012-05-11T01:00:00+01:00,Ministry of Defence,"The flagship venue for this year’s Armed Forces Day event, which takes place on 30 June, is Plymouth.


Last year an estimated 100,000 people enjoyed celebrations in Edinburgh, the city chosen as the focal point for the national event. Meanwhile hundreds of thousands more supported Armed Forces Day across various locations up and down the UK.


As always, the event aims to raise awareness of the contribution made to Britain by those who serve and have served in the Armed Forces. Secondly, it allows the nation to show their support for the men and women who make up the Armed Forces community, from serving troops to Service families, veterans and cadets.


Across the UK, communities are encouraged to get involved and will hold local events.


Last month, the Lord Mayor of Plymouth, Councillor Peter Brookshaw, accepted the official Armed Forces Day Flag on behalf of the city and promised a first class programme of entertainment.


At this stage, organisers are staying tight-lipped on who the big name guests will include but the MOD has confirmed that senior royalty will drop in on events in Plymouth to lend support while the Chiefs of Staff will attend regional events across the country.


Events up and down Great Britain in support of Armed Forces Day will appeal across the generations from grandparents to the youngest child.


In Plymouth, the highlights of the day will include a drumhead service, a Dakota and Spitfire from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, a display by the Red Arrows, an RAF Typhoon flypast, and Royal Navy ships in Plymouth Sound, in an apt tribute to a home of military maritime history.


There will also be veterans parades, village fetes and dinner-dances held across the country, and celebrities who have pledged their support ahead of 30 June include tennis star Andy Murray, David Beckham and Dame Vera Lynn.


Actor Hugh Grant said:
“To all UK Armed Forces I, like everyone I know, feel only massive respect and gratitude and admiration. All the very best.”


Other celebrity supporters include Olympic swimmer Rebecca Adlington, Richard Branson, Christine Bleakley, John Barrowman, Kym Marsh, Jenson Button, Bruce Forsyth, Barbara Windsor and Lorraine Kelly.


Sport promises to play a major part in promoting the event. Armed Forces Day takes place on the first weekend of the Wimbledon tennis tournament. Last year, a dozen lucky military personnel who gave up their holidays to work as stewards at the tournament were invited into the royal box to enjoy the men’s final.


This year, the SW19 committee at the All England Lawn Tennis Club plans to invite troops who recently returned from Afghanistan into the royal box on Saturday 30 June to mark Armed Forces Day.


Not to be outdone, the Football Association will follow suit and invite troops to mingle with the England team at their St George’s Park training base on Friday 1 June ahead of their friendly match against Belgium the next day, and be photographed alongside the England stars.


The same weekend, the Epsom Derby will kick-start the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations and troops will pose alongside the winning jockeys.


And on Armed Forces Day itself, the Round the Island Race will see approximately 40 military boats taking part in the famous race in the waters around the Isle of Wight, with donations benefiting chosen charity ‘Toe in the Water’, which uses competitive sailing to inspire injured servicemen and women.


The Crew Clothing Company are also in talks to sponsor Armed Forces Day.


In a sign of the times, the MOD plans to capitalise on the phenomenon of social media to promote Armed Forces Day. More than one million users have already said they ‘like’ the Armed Forces Day page on Facebook, there are over 10,000 followers on Twitter, and Mumsnet will tweet messages of support in the run-up to the day.


All reservists are encouraged to wear their uniforms to work, as will cadets.


Many businesses will offer attractive discounts to troops who show their ID cards or Veterans Badge. Last year, Crown Carveries, a leading restaurant chain in the Midlands, offered free meals, which was hugely popular, and they have generously agreed to repeat the arrangement.


And here in the capital, London cabbies will adorn their black cabs with Armed Forces Day stickers distributed free with their Taxi trade magazine.

The intention is to lease MV Polarbjørn, a Norwegian ice patrol ship, for an initial period of three years,” Lord Astor said.




The ship’s mission is to patrol and survey the Antarctic and South Atlantic, after the Portsmouth-based Endurance suffered a flood in 2008 following a maintenance error off the coast of Chile.


HMS Endurance has been docked at HM Naval Base Portsmouth ever since she was transported back to the UK on a special container ship in 2009.


MV Polarbjørn, as HMS Protector, is due to arrive in May for refitting ahead of deployment.


Lord Astor said a contract for the lease was expected to be signed soon with GC Rieber Shipping - the Government’s preferred bidders.


Six ships of the Royal Navy have previously been called HMS Protector, including an Antarctic survey vessel which served from 1936 to 1970.


HMS Scott, which is not an icebreaker but which has been conducting patrols in the Antarctic, will continue with her Ocean Survey Programme once she has received maintenance back in the UK.

During the evening, two formations of Tornados and Typhoons took part with allied aircraft from several other nations in a co-ordinated and highly accurate strike by NATO on a large command compound at Hun in central Libya, used by former regime leaders to co-ordinate attacks on the Libyan people.


Eleven Paveway bombs were dropped by RAF aircraft on military targets within the compound, including the central headquarters facility.


The early hours of Wednesday saw another military command node in Zlitan destroyed as well as armed reconnaissance patrols in the west of the country near Tripoli and Az Zawiyah.


Major General Nick Pope, the Chief of the Defence Staff’s Communications Officer, said:




These conducted precision strikes on former regime facilities at Sabratha, including a commando base which had been used by Colonel Gaddafi’s men to launch numerous reprisals against the local people.






The base suffered severe damage and it is reported that it is now in the hands of the Free Libyan Forces and permanently removed as a threat to the safety of the town’s population.




In the late afternoon, a further RAF patrol identified a force of pro-Gaddafi troops which had been fighting at the oil refinery on the coast at Az Zawiyah. The armed vehicles on which they had relied to mount their attacks had been taken out of action by a NATO strike, but they were observed to use a tug boat, which had been commandeered as a naval patrol craft, in an attempt to redeploy to new positions along the coast.


General Pope continued:




Since it was clear from their actions that these troops continued to pose a threat to the local population, the RAF patrol engaged the ship. Although a challenging target, small and under way at sea, a direct hit was scored with a laser-guided Paveway bomb which sank the vessel.


This is a tribute to the professionalism of the aircrew in tracking a moving target with the laser designator, and the accuracy of the weapon system.






It is of note that Colonel Gaddafi is reportedly claiming that NATO has attacked the historic remains of the ancient city of Lepcis Magna. This is nonsense. The UK and its allies are very well aware of the UNESCO [United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation] World Heritage site and take every precaution to avoid damage.


The RAF did attack, in the early hours of Monday morning, a psychological warfare centre over a mile from Lepcis Magna. All four Paveway guided bombs were observed to score direct hits on their proper target.




RAF VC10 and TriStar tankers, and Sentry and Sentinel surveillance aircraft, provided extensive support to these and other NATO missions.


Since the start of military operations on 19 March, Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and Army Air Corps precision strikes have damaged or destroyed some 870 former regime targets which posed a threat to the Libyan people.

Separately, the Ministry of Defence announced that yesterday, 5 April 2011, RAF Tornado GR4s again deployed from Gioia del Colle in Italy to conduct armed air reconnaissance and overwatch patrols over Libya.


In the course of this action, a number of Paveway IV and Brimstone missiles were launched at military targets in the areas of Misurata and Sirte. A total of 12 targets were hit - six armoured fighting vehicles and six battle tanks.


Two Typhoon aircraft also flew from Gioia del Colle to police the no-fly zone, and two RAF VC10 tanker aircraft supported these operations, providing air-to-air refuelling.

Meanwhile, in agreement with NATO, the UK is to move four RAF Typhoons from an air defence role, policing the no-fly zone, to a ground attack role - further bolstering the coalition’s ability to strike targets on the ground. This follows yesterday’s deployment of an additional four RAF Tornados to Gioia del Colle in support of the ongoing operation. The UK currently has 16 ground attack aircraft under NATO command. This meets present operational requirements.


The total number of UK fast jets deployed in southern Italy, including those under UK command on standby to support operations, currently stands at 20.


The Royal Navy continues to play a vital role in the NATO maritime element of Operation UNIFIED PROTECTOR. HMS Brocklesby and HMS Cumberland are both enforcing the arms embargo on Libya.


Mr Hague said that the coalition has ‘all but eliminated’ the Gaddafi regime’s air defence capability and stopped it from bombarding Libyan cities from the air.


The Foreign Secretary also said that the coalition is destroying key regime military assets, including main battle tanks and mobile artillery, and that the arms embargo is being enforced.


However, Mr Hague warned that the regime is still able to inflict considerable damage on Libya’s civilian population using ground forces, and indeed is deliberately inflicting such harm, particularly in the towns of Brega, Misurata and Zintan, where the heaviest fighting is taking place.




So long as the regime continues to attack areas of civilian population, the coalition will continue military action to implement the UN Security Council Resolution,” Mr Hague said.




Mr Hague said that the UK is also one of over thirty nations contributing to the humanitarian effort in Libya. Food distribution is taking place at six locations in opposition-held areas in the east of the country.


Mr Hague said:




The World Food Programme has over ten thousand tonnes of food positioned inside Libya and neighbouring countries, and hopes to reach 85,000 people. DFID [Department for International Development] is flying tents for over 10,000 displaced people from its stocks in Dubai to be distributed by the Red Crescent.






Several consignments of medical supplies have been successfully delivered to Misurata, and yesterday a Turkish hospital ship was able to evacuate 230 wounded people.




The Foreign Secretary said that a further British diplomatic mission has travelled to Benghazi, led by Christopher Prentice, and, while Britain is not engaged in arming the opposition forces, it is prepared to supply non-lethal equipment to help protect civilian lives and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid.

It is the home defence unit of the British Overseas Territory of Bermuda.


The secondment of the two Royal Anglian soldiers, paid for by the Government of Bermuda, is a direct result of an affiliation that goes right back to the First World War when the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps sent men to serve in the trenches with The Lincolnshire Regiment, which eventually became part of what is now The Royal Anglian Regiment.


Heading up the training team is Major Phil Birch, who is currently working as The Bermuda Regiment’s Staff Officer. He said:




With this shared history, we’re delighted to assist the regiment fulfil its key roles today; supporting the Bermuda Police Service and undertaking post-disaster relief work at home and in the Caribbean region.






The regiment’s profile has risen dramatically in the Caribbean region following deployments to assist in the Cayman Islands [2004], Grenada [2005] and the Turks and Caicos Islands [2008], and more recently in Bermuda itself for Hurricane Igor [2010].






The Bermudians are well used to post-hurricane operations but we are able to contribute wider operational experience which is not available locally.






It’s great to know that The Royal Anglian Regiment is always asked to support The Bermuda Regiment due to our historical links.




As Bermuda is a British Overseas Territory, and defence is therefore the responsibility of the United Kingdom, The Bermuda Regiment is under the control of the Governor, Sir Richard Gozney, who is also the Commander-in-Chief. He said:




The elected Government of Bermuda is financially responsible for The Bermuda Regiment. The UK retains ultimate responsibility for the security of the island.






Its remote location means that, in a crisis, we would have to rely on our own resources until help arrived. I believe the regiment provides considerable reassurance to Bermuda.




Last November the regiment’s disaster management work was also recognised by its Colonel-in-Chief, Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Gloucester, when she presented it with new colours.


In her speech, she referred to their:




special expertise in reacting to hurricanes which can visit this part of the planet and where a reliable body of men and women equipped with modern gear and communications are a vital support to an afflicted community.




The Bermuda Regiment is listed in the British Army Order of Battle as number 28 in order of precedence.

A small team from 15 POG has been continuously deployed to Helmand for six years.


Working predominantly with the Afghan civilian population it has sought to inform, reassure, educate and through the promotion of free and unbiased discussion persuade Afghans that their futures are best served not with the Taliban, nor with ISAF, but with themselves and their elected government.


The unit runs a network of radio stations employing local Afghan’s as DJs, broadcasting music, poetry, debate programmes and even a Helmandi soap opera, as well as producing graphical posters and leaflets to communicate in an area where literacy rates are only around 20%.


Recent projects include information campaigns to prevent children picking up spent ordnance they find, disseminating information from farming and veterinary workshops using their radio stations, and promoting debate on political issues of the day.

Speaking about the award, the Commanding Officer of 15 POG, Commander Steve Tatham Royal Navy, said:




We are delighted that our work is being recognised by this award. We are proud of our achievements helping foster better relations with the Afghans and building a sense of community and nationality, and of our support Task Force Helmand’s wider aims.






The levels of literacy and technology in Helmand present challenges for us, but there is an appetite for information, education and debate that our work helps to satisfy.

AES
) dog. The 22-month-old ‘superhero’ spaniel and his handler, Lance Corporal Liam Tasker, are part of the Theatre Military Working Dog Support Unit (
TMWDSU
) based at Camp Bastion.


Theo is on his first tour of duty in Afghanistan. A tour is normally six months, with the dogs then returning to their home at 104 Military Working Dog Support Unit at North Luffenham, Rutland, but due to his success rate, Theo’s tour has been extended by a month.


Before coming to Afghanistan, Theo had to undergo a rigorous period of training to ensure he would meet the highest standards expected of the dogs in the 
TMWDSU
. The first stage was 16 weeks’ basic training and assessment before being given to a handler. Theo and Lance Corporal Tasker then spent 15 weeks on a handlers’ course, where man and dog learn to work as a team.


As an 
AES
 dog, Theo’s task is to locate weapons and 
IEDs
. He is normally the ‘front man’ of the patrol, sniffing out any hidden devices. In Theo’s first five months of duty he notched up 14 operational finds.


Lance Corporal Tasker said:




I love my job and working together with Theo. He has a great character and never tires. He can’t wait to get out and do his job and will stop at nothing.




Lance Corporal Tasker initially joined the Army as a mechanic and spent six years with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. He did not know the 
TMWDSU
 existed until a friend showed him some videos of the dogs in action. He decided to switch jobs and has not regretted it for a second.


Lance Corporal Tasker’s six-month tour has not been extended, but Theo will be in the excellent care of the 
TMWDSU
 and its handlers during his extra month in theatre.


The 
TMWDSU
 has over 50 dogs, many of which are spaniels. They are trained as protection or search dogs. Theo was donated by a member of the public. Other dogs have come from dogs’ homes or the RSPCA. All of them provide an invaluable service to the troops in Afghanistan and their work has saved many lives.




Please note that since this story was published Lance Corporal Tasker was sadly killed in Afghanistan and his dog Theo subsequently died after suffering a seizure.

consultation on the implementation
 of the 
Ivory Act
.


Once implemented, the Ivory Act, which was a key government manifesto commitment, will introduce a near total ban on the import, export and dealing of items containing elephant ivory in the UK, regardless of their age, allowing only for a narrowly defined set of exemptions.


Elephants are the world’s largest land mammal and can live past 60 years of age in the wild. However they are commonly targeted for their tusks. The savanna elephant populations declined by about 30 per cent - equal to 144,000 elephants - across 15 African countries between 2007 and 2014. The UK’s landmark Ivory Act will help protect the world’s elephants by banning sales of ivory that may contribute to poaching.


The eight-week consultation seeks views on the registration and certification process and fees for exempted items. People will only need to register and certify items for the purposes of dealing in items containing ivory. Those who own but are not planning to sell ivory items do not need to register and certify them.




Animal Welfare Minister Lord Goldsmith said:


Our Ivory Act introduces one of the world’s toughest bans on elephant ivory sales, ensuring that we do everything we can to save this magnificent species from extinction.


As a global leader in animal conservation, we are sending a clear message that we consider the commercial trade in elephant ivory to be totally unacceptable.






Dr Mark Jones, Head of Policy at the Born Free Foundation, said:


In passing the Ivory Act into law, the UK Government has boldly introduced some of the toughest restrictions on ivory trade anywhere in the world, vindicating Born Free’s longstanding assertion that only by banning the trade in ivory can we hope to bring an end to the industrial-scale poaching of elephants for their tusks.




The Government made a manifesto commitment to bring the ivory ban into force and to extend it to cover other ivory-bearing species such as narwhals, killer whales and hippos. Defra is currently considering evidence submitted in response to a 
call for evidence on non-elephant ivory trade
, and will be consulting on this later in the year.


The implementation of the Ivory Act was delayed due to unsuccessful legal challenges but it will now help cement the UK’s place as a global leader in conversation and will help us play a leading role internationally in addressing threats to endangered species.


The UK government is working closely with the international community to address the threats to the conservation of elephants from poaching and both the legal and illegal ivory trade. Since 2014 the UK has contributed £2.6 million to projects around the world to stop the ivory trade through the 
Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund
.


The eight-week consultation by can be found 
here
.


The Ivory Act 2018 creates narrow and carefully defined exemptions to the ban for:




Items with only a small amount of ivory. Such items must comprise less than 10% ivory by volume and have been made prior to 1947.


Musical instruments. These must have an ivory content of less than 20% by volume and have been made prior to 1975.


Portrait miniatures. A specific exemption for portrait miniatures – which were often painted on thin slivers of ivory – made before 1918 and with a surface area of no more than 320cm2.


Sales to and hire agreements with qualifying museums.


The rarest and most important items of their type. These must be items of outstanding artistic, cultural or historic value, and made prior to 1918. Decisions on applications for such items will be based on expert advice from a selection of institutions deemed to have the necessary knowledge and expertise.

The Community Games programme will provide support and resources for communities to organise their own local sporting and cultural events in celebration of the London 2012 Games. The events will be anything from a triathlon or a sponsored walk to a live concert, and will reflect the interests and needs of the local community.


Community Games was the brainchild of Legacy UK, a charity whose role is to create lasting impact from the Olympic and Paralympic Games by funding ideas and local talent to inspire creativity across the UK.  The Community Games programme will provide support and resources which includes a national accredited training and mentoring programme, designed to create a lasting legacy of community volunteers with the skills and confidence to activate social change.


Local people will have the opportunity to get involved in Community Games in a number of different ways. They could become a Community Games organiser responsible for developing and implementing a Community Games event, they could volunteer to help out at an event, they could participate in the events activities, or they could just simply come along, have fun and enjoy the event as a spectator with friends and family.


Minister for Civil Society, Nick Hurd, said:




We want everyone to get involved and celebrate the London 2012 Games coming to the UK and this is why we have awarded Community Games £2 million. Community Games will provide the help and support people need to organise a run, a triathlon or even a dance contest display in their local area this summer. This is all part of our drive to create a bigger stronger society where people are empowered to make a difference to their community.




Moira Swinbank, Chief Executive of Legacy Trust UK, said:




Legacy Trust UK is all about securing a legacy from London 2012 in communities’ right across the UK, and what better way to do this than through Community Games?  We’re delighted that the potential of this regional programme has been recognised, and look forward to working with the County Sports Partnership Network and the YMCA to bring a taste of the Olympic and Paralympic Games to millions of people throughout England.




The award also heralds the creation of a new partnership between the County Sports Partnership Network (CSPN) and the YMCA to run the England-wide Community Games programme.  The collaboration will benefit from the CSPN’s expertise in promoting physical activity participation at a local level, coupled with the YMCA’s 166 years of experience of helping to build positive futures for young people and communities.

CAB 007-13


People want a broader choice in the public services available, and how they are delivered, from hospitals and schools to social care, according to an 
independent review
 conducted by David Boyle, published today.


Ministers had asked David Boyle to look specifically at whether there were barriers to choice in public services for those from a disadvantaged background. After talking to people across the country Mr Boyle’s review produced three key findings:


First, that the bureaucratic barriers to choice remain powerful if you are less confident or articulate; and if you want something slightly out of the mainstream then there is inequality present in the scope of choice available to everyday people across the UK;


Second, people, especially the disadvantaged, need information and advice on what choices are available to them, yet often this proves problematic. Some people do not easily have access to the internet and this makes it even harder to find out what choices are available, and they also want face to face advice to make sense of it;


Finally, what you find when you talk to people about choice in detail is that the kind of choices they _think _they are getting are often not what they are being offered in reality, and there is a need for more flexibility in the way services are delivered.


Launching the review David Boyle said:




I’ve been speaking to people the length and breadth of Britain and what is clear is that people from all backgrounds want to have a choice in the services they receive, but they want a meaningful choice - which means they have the information and the advice they need, and the confidence and authority to ask for flexibility in the way services are delivered.


Too often in the past, people from disadvantaged backgrounds have lost out because while choice and flexibility is available, they haven’t been able to access it. As we look to increase the choices available to patients, parents and others, it is absolutely vital that everyone can benefit. I hope this review can help them get those choices, but also that it helps broaden the choice debate and the scope of choice.




Minister for Government Policy Oliver Letwin said:




Too often in the past people have had to make do with whatever services the state deemed best for them, with no chance to say what was right for them and their families. We want to consign that one size fits all approach to history. People should be able to choose the services that are right for them. I’m really pleased to see David Boyle’s review and look forward to seeing how we can take forward his recommendations to make choice a reality.




Minister of State in the Cabinet Office David Laws said:




We are committed to making sure people from all walks of life can benefit from the best public services, whether we’re talking about schools, hospitals or social care, and that means removing the barriers that stop many from our most disadvantaged communities from having a choice. David Boyle’s review sets out some important recommendations for how we go about doing that.

Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude said:




Union claims of nearly half a million public service workers on strike have been shown to be wildly inaccurate. A more realistic figure is close to 150,000 - a fraction of the number claimed.


We can confirm that 102,244 civil servants were on strike - dramatically down from 146,000 in November.


The combination of the dedicated majority of public service workers who came to work as usual and our rigorous contingency plans ensured that public services were mainly unaffected.


After more than a year of discussions we have put forward the proposed final agreements. It is now time that union leaders put the best interests of their members first by asking them to accept our generous offer.

22 November 2010


Public services should be delivered online or by other digital means, the government has announced in response to a report by UK Digital Champion Martha Lane Fox.


Both the report and the government’s response have called for a channel shift that will increasingly see public services provided digitally ‘by default’.


The report recommended a radical improvement to government internet services to provide higher quality and a more convenient 24/7 service to users - a move which could also save billions.


Other recommendations include:




Making Directgov the ‘customer champion with teeth’ to drive up the quality of government’s online services


Simplifying the user experience by making all of government’s transactional services available through Directgov


Ensuring online government information and services are available wherever people are on the web by opening up applications and services to other organisations


Asking  Directgov and Business Link to create a plan of what would be involved to converge the sites into a single domain




Responding to the report, Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude said:




We will use digital technology to drive better services and lower costs. At present we inherited contracts that effectively limit the number of people who can use some online services. And for most benefits it is simply not possible to apply online. This is inconvenient, expensive, wasteful and ridiculous and it can not continue.




“The shift towards online services also has the power to transform the relationship between government and individuals. As Martha Lane Fox’s insightful report shows, quality online services can be the default solution for people needing government services.

A fundamental shift in the way government operates, which sees the Efficiency and Reform Group enforcing financial controls across all departments and driving a business-like approach in Whitehall, has accelerated savings, putting the government on track to save £20 billion a year by 2015, the Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude announced today.


Interim results show departments have saved £3.1 billion so far this financial year and are expected to save more than £8 billion by the year end. These figures were released today at the inaugural government analysts briefing event. At the event financial analysts had the opportunity to scrutinise interim results from the first half of 2012/13, and to examine the Efficiency and Reform Group’s business plans and commercial targets for the remainder of the financial year.


Today’s figures follow a renewed drive within the Efficiency and Reform Group - the Government’s new operations centre - which was recently boosted by the appointment of Chloe Smith as a Minister in the Cabinet Office and Stephen Kelly, former Chief Executive Officer of FTSE Company MicroFocus, as the Government’s Chief Operating Officer.


Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude said:




At this morning’s inaugural analysts event we invited the financial analyst community to scrutinise our savings for the very first time - we know that with their knowledge and expertise we can find even greater savings for taxpayers.


Our fundamental programme of reform is changing the way Whitehall operates and driving efficiency savings to make every taxpayer pound count. Thanks to the hard work of hundreds of civil servants in the Efficiency and Reform Group and beyond we have helped departments save £3.1 billion so far this financial year, putting us on track to save £8 billion by year end.


We have said we want to be saving £20 billion a year by 2015 and savings of this magnitude cannot come by trimming budgets here and there. That’s why we are working to transform Whitehall into a leaner, more efficient machine that manages its finances like the best-run businesses.


We are taking the tough decisions required to ensure that Britain can compete in a global race. We cannot go back to the old days of waste and profligacy.




The interim departmental results of £3.1 billion announced today build on the 
£5.5 billion of savings in 2011/12
 and the 
£3.75 billion saved during 2010/11
. They include:




£680 million through the moratorium on consultancy and contingent labour spend and on extending existing consultancy contracts;


£170 million from reductions in the in-year cost of the government’s property estate, by exiting unnecessary properties, and questioning each and every lease break before they get extended;


£295 million by using government’s bulk-buying power and pooling spend on goods and services used by different departments; and


£900 million from salary cost, achieved by reducing the size of the Civil Service through stronger controls on non-essential recruitment.




Notes to editors




Since 2010 the Minister for the Cabinet Office, Francis Maude, has worked closely with the Chief Secretary for the Treasury to lead a major programme of radical reform to Government operations. The program strategically focuses on eliminating wasteful and low value spend, reforming government business to lock in efficiencies and generate savings for the taxpayer.


In 2011/12, UK central Government spent around £45 billion on goods and services which is equivalent to approximately 3% of GDP. Last year, the Cabinet Office helped departments across Whitehall save £5.5 billion. These savings were driven by the Cabinet Office’s Efficiency and Reform Group (ERG) which applied controls to cut expenditure by departments on commercial contracts, IT, property, marketing, temporary staff and consultancy.


These figures represent our best interim assessment of the Government’s progress against meeting the above objectives based on interim team reports. These savings figures are not national or official statistics; they are management information evidenced, normally, by department reports. These figures have not been assured by our internal auditors or the NAO.


The Efficiency and Reform Group reports to Francis Maude, and is overseen by an Efficiency Board chaired jointly by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, and the Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General, Francis Maude.


Chloe Smith MP was appointed the Minister for Political and Constitutional Reform in September and supports the Deputy Prime Minister across the full range of political and constitutional issues. In addition to this role, Chloe supports the Minister for the Cabinet Office on some aspects of the Efficiency and Reform and Civil Service Reform agenda, as well as Cyber Security and Civil Contingencies.


Stephen Kelly was appointed Chief Operating Officer for Government in September. In this role he will help the Government to go even further with its crucial efficiency and reform agenda and build on the £5.5 billion of efficiency savings achieved last year.


The Cabinet Office ensures departments work together to tackle waste and improve accountability across a range of areas, including information and communications technology (ICT), procurement, projects, HR and property.

Cities are key to ensuring economic growth across the country, so it is vital to capitalise on opportunities and improve the way in which Government works with them. This will mean that government can maintain its crucial role in setting infrastructure and national policies, whilst cities can be free to work in ways that suit them.


The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister have asked Greg Clark to take on the role of Minister for Cities in addition to his existing responsibilities. He will also become a Minister in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and will report directly to the Secretary of State for Business and Secretary of State for Communities.


The Deputy Prime Minister will chair a Ministerial Group including the Minister for Cities. The group will seek to develop new ideas for cities and consider the impact of existing policies. Lord John Shipley will also act as an adviser to government on cities policy, drawing on his extensive experience as the Leader of Newcastle City Council.


In recognition of the varied characteristics of cities, the intention is to combine a cross-cutting approach with work to look at cities on an individual basis. This will start initially by focusing on the Core Cities and their surrounding areas, with a view to expanding to a broader group and identifying issues relevant to a wide range of cities.


The Core Cities - enormously important for national prosperity and for their local and regional economies - are the eight largest cities outside of London:




Birmingham


Bristol


Leeds


Liverpool


Manchester


Newcastle


Nottingham


Sheffield 




The Deputy Prime Minister, Rt Hon Nick Clegg MP, said:




The Minister for Cities will champion the economic, social and environmental role of  cities. He will be the first point of contact in understanding the challenges and opportunities for cities in creating growth and prosperity across the country.


I look forward to working with Greg and the rest of the Ministerial Group on Cities to take forward this agenda, and identify solutions to support our city leaders in driving future development and prosperity.




Greg Clark, Minister for Cities, said:




I am thrilled to be appointed Minister for Cities. For Britain to be successful, Britain’s cities need to be successful. Our cities generate well over half of our wealth and are home to the majority of our businesses and our leading universities. If our cities do well, the country does well. I am looking forward to working with the leaders of Britain’s cities to ensure that the Government does everything possible to help urban Britain thrive.




Business Secretary Vince Cable said:




Britain’s cities contain some of our most serious social problems, but also have the greatest potential for economic expansion. My department is working hard to unlock that growth potential. I am delighted Greg Clark is taking on this role to continue this focus on the opportunities in our cities.


We are already creating new Enterprise Zones and supporting the development of Local Enterprise Partnerships across England and I look forward to working with Greg on further development of our plans to secure long-term sustainable growth for the future.




Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:




If we want our cities to be able to compete on the global stage, then we have to start locally. That’s why we’re putting decisions on growth in the hands of the local leaders and businesses who understand their local economy - through Local Enterprise Partnerships and Enterprise Zones, and rewarding councils that support local firms and jobs by keeping their own business rates.


As Cities Minister, Greg Clark will take forward our work and unleash the potential that exists in our cities so they are engines of growth for the whole country, and become the best places in Europe to start and grow a business.




Notes to editors




Greg Clark will take on the responsibility as Minister for Cities immediately, in addition to his responsibilities as Minister for Decentralisation.  He will report jointly to the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government in this new capacity.


Lord Shipley will advise the Minister for Cities and the Ministerial Group in an unpaid capacity.  As the former leader of Newcastle City Council between 2006 and 2010, he brings knowledge of the challenges and opportunities that exist within our cities.


The Core Cities group consists of  the eight largest English cities excluding London. Research commissioned by the Core Cities group states that the cities and their hinterlands account for 27% of England’s wealth generation, and are home to more than a third of England’s population.


This change relates only to English cities.  However, where appropriate, we expect to make links with the Devolved Administrations to ensure all UK cities have the opportunities to thrive.

Earlier today Nick Hurd and Chief Executive of the National Association for Voluntary and Community Action (NAVCA) Kevin Curley travelled to SMART in Kensington and Chelsea to support a small London charity’s Christmas appeal.  


SMART (St Mary Abbots Rehabilitation and Training) has helped hundreds of people with long term mental illness gain new skills and find employment. They run a cafe and offer training in skills as diverse as IT and floristry. 


This Christmas, like many small charities, SMART is appealing for time, money and other gifts to bring a bit of cheer to the people it helps all year round. The charity also sells wreaths and cards made by its members to raise funds. Small charities rely on the generosity of local people with around 67% of funds coming from public donations compared to 38% for big organisations.


Nick Hurd Minister for Civil Society, said:




Over Christmas charities large and small will be taking care of people who need help. Small charities often go unnoticed which is a shame because they make such a huge difference. We all have a responsibility to help make the places where we live a little better and giving to a local charity is a great way to go about it.


SMART in Kensington and Chelsea, is a wonderful small charity that is valued highly by all the people that live in the area. I’m very pleased to be here with Kevin Curley, who represents charities like this across the country, to support SMART’s Christmas Appeal. I wish them the very best success.




Kevin Curley, Chief Executive of NAVCA, said:




Local Charities and community groups couldn’t exist without the support of local people and local businesses. SMART is a great example of just how much a local charity can do with a relatively small amount of money. I hope people will consider how they can support charities and community groups in their area, by giving either money or their time.




Amelia Mustapha, Director of SMART, said:




For £250 we can open on Christmas day and feed forty people. Funding is tight for charities like us at the moment but we don’t waste anything so I think we will be alright. It’s great to have Nick and Kevin here to support us and other local charity Christmas appeals across the country.  People do want to help, they just need to know we’re here.

The objectives of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland agreed between the UK and the EU in 2019
are to protect the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement in all its dimensions; to respect Northern Ireland’s
integral place in the United Kingdom, its internal market and customs territory; to uphold the essential
state functions and territorial integrity of the United Kingdom; to avoid a hard border on the island of
Ireland; and to help protect the EU’s Single Market.






It is now widely accepted by all parties that the current operation of this Protocol does not fully support these objectives and that changes are needed if the current situation is to improve. It is clear, including from recent polling, that a large majority across Northern Ireland shares that perspective.






The Command Paper we published on 21 July outlined comprehensive and lasting solutions to the
current difficulties. We decided then that the right route was to prioritise negotiated change to the
Protocol rather than, at that point, use the Protocol’s Article 16 safeguard measures. I and my team
have engaged in detailed negotiations with the EU Commission on this basis in recent months.






There has been some progress, but not as much, and not as quickly as we had hoped. Although we
 have worked with the proposals put forward by the Commission in mid-October, they do not solve the
 problems, and even in some aspects take us back from the current unsatisfactory status quo.






The main area of progress has been on medicine supply to Northern Ireland. I believe that our
proposal to remove medicines from the Protocol is still the most straightforward solution, given that
the provision of health services is an essential state function and that Northern Ireland medicines are
overwhelmingly sourced from elsewhere in the UK. But we have been willing to look at the EU’s
preferred option, pursuing unilateral amendment of its own laws. The EU’s proposals, published
today, follow on from discussions between our teams. They could constitute a constructive way
forward, and we are willing to look at them positively, but as we have not been able to scrutinise the
texts in the necessary detail we are not yet able to make that judgement with full confidence.






There has been much less progress in other areas. The burdensome customs and SPS arrangements
for goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland have had a chilling effect on trade,
increasing costs and discouraging firms from trading within their own country. It is vital to get the
arrangements in this area right, given the overwhelming importance to the Northern Ireland economy
of links with the rest of the UK. We have argued consistently that the simplest solution is to put in
place substantively different processes for goods which all sides agree will stay in the UK and those
which do not. These should cover not only goods moved directly, but also the increasing proportion of
goods moved by parcel, and other kinds of movements such as pets, livestock, plants, and seeds. The
proposals made by the EU in October constituted a step forward but, based on what we have heard to
date, our expert analysis does not support the ambitious public claims made for them. Overall, it is not
possible to envisage an agreed solution which does not deliver significant change in this area.






Nor have we managed to have a constructive discussion about the regulatory burdens being faced by operators in Great Britain looking to place manufactured goods on the market in Northern Ireland.These burdens will get worse over time as UK and EU rules diverge.






We have had some limited discussions on subsidy control. The Protocol’s provisions in this area,
leaving Northern Ireland subject to EU state aid rules, were agreed in 2019. Since then, the UK and the
EU have agreed entirely new subsidy control rules in our new free trade deal and we have brought in
an entirely new national subsidy control regime. The rules need to evolve to reflect this new reality.
Northern Ireland businesses are facing unjustified burdens and complexity, and the Government
cannot deliver aid to Northern Ireland, for example for Covid recovery support, without asking for the
EU’s permission. We need to find more appropriate and proportionate arrangements that reflect the
low level of risks posed to the single market in practice by subsidies in Northern Ireland.






There have been relatively constructive discussions on VAT and excise policy, but we have not yet
 found a way of ensuring that Northern Ireland can properly benefit from its place in the United
 Kingdom’s VAT and excise area in the same way as other parts of the UK.






Finally, a solution is needed on governance. As the EU’s preferred way forward on medicines
illustrates, neither Northern Ireland nor the UK more broadly gets any say on the way EU legislation is
imposed on Northern Ireland. This remains a fundamental issue of democratic accountability. Nor is
it reasonable or fair for disputes between the UK and the EU relating to the Protocol to be settled in
the EU Court of Justice, the court of one of the parties. The Withdrawal Agreement already provides
for the use of an independent arbitration mechanism instead, and the simplest and most durable way
forward would be to agree that this should be the sole route for settling disputes in future.






Overall, with the potential exception of medicines, I do not believe that the negotiations are yet close
to delivering outcomes which can genuinely solve the problems presented by the Protocol. The EU’s
proposals only cover certain areas and would not do enough to ease the burdens faced by people in
Northern Ireland; or to create the conditions for genuinely cross-community support.






Our preference would be to reach a comprehensive solution dealing with all the issues. However,
given the gravity and urgency of the difficulties, we have been prepared to consider an interim
agreement as a first step to deal with the most acute problems, including trade frictions, subsidy
control, and governance. Such an agreement would still leave many underlying strains unresolved, for
example those caused by diverging UK and EU rules over time. It would therefore be inherently
provisional by nature and would accordingly need to include mechanisms for addressing outstanding
issues and resolving new concerns as they arise. The UK has proposed a number of possible ways
forward, but regrettably it has not so far been possible to make progress even on what the core
elements of an interim agreement might be.






It is disappointing that it has not been possible to reach either a comprehensive or worthwhile interim
agreement this year. A solution needs to be found urgently early next year. For as long as there is no
agreed solution, we remain ready to use the Article 16 safeguard mechanism if that is the only way to
protect the prosperity and stability of Northern Ireland and its people.

The framework is one of the most SME-friendly to date – approximately a third of the interested businesses are SMEs.


The tender, which invited businesses to apply for the opportunity to supply G-Cloud services, was published on 18 October and has already received 532 expressions of interest. The response prompted the Cabinet Office to review the deadline to give more companies an opportunity to apply.


G-Cloud services are a “pay as you go” approach to IT: adopting these services will allow the public sector to use “off the shelf” IT services, such as email, paid for on a usage basis rather than developing their own systems. This way the government can then use what it wants, when it wants it and avoid duplicating services that cannot be shared.


The framework, worth up to £60 million, is one of the most SME-friendly frameworks to date and has a number of aspects that make it more accessible to SMEs, including:




less stringent evidence of financial history required of all SMEs who apply


open procedure with no lengthy pre-qualification questionnaire (PQQ)


a simple spreadsheet with simple yes/no answers to the mandatory questions rather than lengthy questions


suppliers are asked what they can offer the government rather than dictating a complicated specification that stifles all innovation


services are provided on the suppliers’ standard terms with a government overlay rather than a unique crown contract


regular updates are provided to the supplier community via twitter; and


an ‘Apply Camp’ was held to aid suppliers with the Tender process - this was live streamed and can be 
watched on Vimeo
.




The initial G-Cloud framework will operate for 6 months and will include all suppliers that pass the simplified assurance processes. Successful suppliers will form the first public sector ICT marketplace, which are expected to be available to all public sector buyers via the “Application Store”. Services available on the Application Store are likely to include: email, word processing, system hosting, enterprise resource planning, electronic records management, customer relationship management and office productivity applications. 


Minister for the Cabinet Office, Francis Maude, said:




G-Cloud is a sign of public sector IT becoming more flexible, modern and better value. The easiest way to think of cloud is as the IT equivalent of a Boris bike - pay for what you need when you need it, and forget about costly ongoing maintenance that you can live without.


It is also an example of government procurement changing - rather than rigid requirements expressed in overly complex tenders, we are asking suppliers what they can offer and setting out our requirements in the simplest way possible. Rather than being risk averse, we are exploring this new area of technology and looking for innovative solutions that will save taxpayers money.




Stephen Allott, crown representative for SMEs, said:




SMEs have been considered at every point possible, and the excellent response shows it’s the right way to go - with hundreds of suppliers registering interest, many of them SMEs.


This is the most innovative framework I’ve seen since working at the Cabinet Office.  Thankfully it’s not the only one. A consultancy framework announced just last week had similar features - simple steps that level the playing field for SMEs. Things are really starting to change.




The deadline for applications is now 3pm on 19 December 2011.

The code, which regulated the employment benefits of new staff recruited by contracted providers of outsourced public services, will be replaced by new 
Principles of Good Employment Practice
 which provide a more flexible guide giving employers the power to build a motivated workforce. 


The decision will remove a significant barrier to smaller organisations that want to deliver public service contracts.


SMEs, charities, social enterprises, voluntary groups and staff owned mutual providers of public services will all benefit from greater freedom to manage their business without central government interference. However, this change will have no impact on the TUPE terms under which public service staff transfer to new organisations. 


Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office, said: 




The two-tier code was a voluntary regulation that did little to protect staff while deterring responsible employers from delivering public service contracts. Small organisations have been particularly hard hit by this two-tier code. We should not be making it more difficult for SMEs and voluntary organisations to succeed in the public service market.


The new Principles of Good Employment Practice set clear standards and give employers freedom to provide terms for staff which are motivating and affordable.




The coalition government is committed to opening up government procurement and reducing costs, so that public services benefit from a more competitive market place.


This announcement builds on the government’s aspiration of awarding 25% of government contracts to SMEs. Measures to support this aspiration include cutting away unnecessary red tape, improving transparency in commissioning and ensuring that major suppliers pay subcontractors working on government contracts within 30 days.

This information has never previously been centrally collated.


The scoping exercise was commissioned by the Minister for the Cabinet Office, Francis Maude to throw further light on the total number of people employed to support the work of the government. The figures are not official statistics, but management information which any large business needs to control on a day-to-day basis in order to run efficiently. Where these datasets are held, the new government has pledged to publish them wherever possible.


As part of this exercise, ministerial and non-ministerial departments, their executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies (
NDPBs
) were asked to provide headcount for all their payroll and contingent staff, including agency workers, interim mangers, specialist contractors and consultants.


The returns from the exercise [available in 
XLS and CSV
 format] so far, which are currently incomplete suggest that:




some 640,000 payroll staff are employed in these organisations


around an additional 20,000 staff classified as contingent labour, suggesting some 3% of staff are non-payroll


the largest numbers are contingent labour are in the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Health and the Environment Agency




Commenting on the initial returns, Francis Maude said:




It’s important the government gets this kind of management information so that it can really get a grip on numbers.


Today’s figures may be a bit rough and ready, but we have to start gathering this kind of information straight away so that we know what the total workforce of government really is.  Until now we’ve only had an incomplete picture of the true numbers of people working for us. But as we continue to push forward with our efficiency agenda, we need to ensure managers have this kind of basic management information.


Even though today’s numbers may not be perfect, it’s important to put what we do know into the public domain straight away as we have promised to be more transparent about what is really going on in government.

Workforce Management Information scoping exercise: explanatory notes


Introduction


The Cabinet Office has undertaken a quick scoping exercise on some key pieces of workforce management information relating to headcount and cost. Today (18 June 2010) - in the interests of transparency - we are publishing the returns received. There are however a number of significant issues with the quality, robustness and coverage of this information which must be considered in viewing these figures. The key definitions used are also outlined below.


Limitations


It should be noted in viewing the figures:




these figures are not official statistics. They are the initial returns received to a scoping exercise on workforce management information. There is no intention to publish this information regularly


the figures are neither complete nor validated, the exercise was conducted under a short time frame limiting the time for quality assurance at an organisational level. No further validation was undertaken centrally. Some organisations have not submitted returns in the timeframe available


extreme caution should be exercised when drawing inferences from the figures. In particular, we do not recommend making comparisons between organisations as differences in how organisations have interpreted the definitions of for example, contingent labour may vary


staff numbers are as at the snapshot reference date 31 March 2010 and cost is for the financial year 2009 to 2010. For many organisations the data will come from different sources and therefore the headcount and cost data should not be directly compared


there were a number of common issues organisations raised in submitting returns. These included:
    


in many cases the number of consultants was not known as the procurement had specified the service to be delivered rather than the number of consultants required


In some organisations contingent labour figures are not held centrally because spending decisions are devolved and where they are it is not always possible to break down the different sorts of contingent labour nor to provide 
FTE
 figures


there is a risk that double counting may have occurred for example, when departmental staff are working in 
NDPBs




finally there is not always a clear boundary between what could be considered a wholly contracted out service as opposed to the use of contractors. Organisations may have interpreted this differently meaning that overall data may not be comparable








Definitions used


Payroll staff


An employee is anyone aged 16 years or over that your organisation directly pays from its payroll(s), in return for carrying out a full-time or part-time job or being on a training scheme. Each employee should have a contract of employment.


The following are included:




agency workers paid directly from the organisation’s payroll(s)


those temporarily absent but still on the payroll(s), for example on maternity leave.




The following are excluded:




agency workers paid directly from the agency payroll


the self-employed


voluntary workers


former employees only receiving a pension


directors who do not receive a salary




Permanent employees are those who have a contract with no agreed expiry date or a fixed term contract of more than 12 months (regardless of the amount of time remaining on the contract).


Temporary/casual employees are those who have a fixed term contract of 12 months or less or are employed on a casual basis.


Agency staff are normally lower grade individuals who are actually filling in for an administrative or clerical role within the organisational structure and ideally on a short term basis typically 3 to 9 months.


Specialist contractors and interim managers are concerned with the fulfillment of particular functional or senior management positions within the organisational structure and ideally on a short term basis typically 3 to 9 months.


OGC
 definition of consultancy: The provision to management of objective advice and assistance relating to strategy structure, management or operations of an organisation in pursuit of its purposes and objectives. Such assistance will be provided outside the ‘business-as-usual’ environment when in-house skills are not available and will be immaterial and time-limited. Services may include the identification of options with recommendations, or assistance with (but not the delivery of) the implementation of solutions.


FTE
 calculation: Full-time employees are counted as 1 full-time equivalent. Part-time employees’ hours should be converted into those worked by full-time employees. For example, if a part-time employee worked 10 hours per week and the full-time working week in your organisation was 37 hours then the part-time employee would equate to 0.27 full-time equivalents (10 divided by 37). Exclude paid and unpaid overtime from full-time equivalent calculations.

Godric Smith has been appointed interim Executive Director of Government Communications until the end of the year. As the most senior communications professional in the civil service he will be based in Downing Street and the Cabinet Office. A process to appoint a permanent successor will begin shortly. He will replace Jenny Grey, who is leaving to join Citigroup this month.


Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude said:




Jenny spearheaded the reforms to government communications we introduced in 2010. As a result, the operation is now leaner, more agile and more strategic - and will deliver more efficient communications for the taxpayer. I wish Jenny well in her new role and thank her for all her work.


The appointment of Godric Smith as interim Executive Director of Government Communications will enable us to continue delivering these important reforms. As a former Prime Minister’s Official Spokesman, and with his excellent work at the Olympic Delivery Authority and as Director of Government Communications London 2012, Godric brings the experience and expertise needed for this important role. I look forward to working with him to deliver effective communications that represent value for taxpayers’ money.




The Prime Minister’s Official Spokesman, Steve Field, has been appointed the UK’s next Executive Director to the International Monetary Fund. A process to appoint his successor is underway and an appointment will be made in the coming weeks. Until that time he will remain in post. He will join the IMF towards the end of the year.


Note to editors




Godric Smith worked at Downing Street from 1996 -2006 including as Prime Minister’s Official Spokesman between 2000 and 2004. He has worked on London 2012 over the last seven years as Director of Communications for the Olympic Delivery Authority - which successfully built the Olympic Park on time and within budget - and as Director of Government Communications for London 2012. He was appointed a Non-Executive Director of HS2 in June this year.

CAB 061-12  


Speaking at the Government Construction Summit on Monday
, Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude will say that the construction sector is undergoing an “era of fundamental reform”. Francis Maude will publish the government’s 
“One Year On” report
, highlighting progress made in reforming public sector construction and detailing £279 million in savings for taxpayers.


The government is taking a long term approach to construction strategy, with a relentless focus on waste, greater transparency on costs, new procurement models which foster collaboration and innovation, and smarter use of technology. It aims to deliver construction projects 15% to 20% more cheaply, saving up to £1.2 billion a year - the equivalent of approximately 60 new secondary schools -  to spend on other government projects.


The “One Year On” report highlights key progress over the year since the government’s ambitious 5 year construction strategy was launched, including:




£279 million cost reductions achieved on new contracts and projects registered during 2011 to 2012


the beginning of a technological revolution, with the first public sector project delivered through Building Information Modelling now underway at Cookham Wood prison


strong relationships with industry, with over 120 private sector representatives playing an active role in implementing the strategy


increased transparency via regular publication of construction spending plans and project pipelines


prompt payment extended down to tier 3 suppliers via Project Bank Accounts for £1.1 billion worth of projects, which pay tier 3 suppliers at the same time as prime contractors




The report details key areas of focus for the coming years, with a fresh push on treatment of companies in the supply chain, including small and medium-sized enterprises (
SMEs
), and a new policy to tighten supplier performance management for key strategic suppliers.


Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude said:




I’m proud of the progress that this government has made as we go through an era of fundamental reform in construction. Greater transparency means we now know how money is being spent and where we can find savings. Savings will come not from simply squeezing margins but by continuing to reform the way government procures and the industry responds, creating a more integrated, efficient sector.


We are working in partnership with industry every step of the way, but we will use our buying power as the industry’s biggest client to insist on change, including the better treatment of the supply chain. Since January 2011 prompt payment is a condition of every government contract but we are going further in agreeing with our key suppliers how they will support their supply chains to deliver greater value.




The government’s Chief Construction Adviser, Paul Morrell said




We continue to work steadily at a strategy that has 3 basic building blocks: improving the skills of government as a client, motivating reform in the way the construction industry works to deliver better value, and simplifying as far as the possible the processes by which government and industry deal with each other. The change will not come overnight; we are dealing with generations of ingrained practice; but just 1 year on I believe we are making real progress, both in the government’s determination to see through this strategy and in the industry’s response.




The government has published an updated list of 32 trial projects, including 12 new trial projects. The projects look at alternative approaches to procurement, including connecting design and construction to the occupation and use of the building through the “soft landings” approach, and crucially the adoption of Building Information Modelling.


Notes for editors


1. The One Year On report and other publications are available 
on GOV.UK
.


2. A number of reports prepared by government/industry task groups will also be published on Monday, including:




procurement and “lean” Client;


standards and lean supply chain; and


a definition of excellence in construction, as the basis of future work to develop a performance management approach to construction suppliers.




3. The Procurement/Lean Client Task Group report includes “a guide to frameworks” for the construction sector, setting out the criteria that it believes distinguish the good from the bad. Characteristics of a good framework include:




work bundled in a way that does not take it out of reach of smaller businesses that would have been capable and competitive in taking on any individual project in the programme, unless they are also designed and managed to capture economies of scale and learning;


appropriate value bands, so that the upper value is not so high as to deter or disqualify 
SMEs
 from capturing work at lower values that they are perfectly capable of handling;


a prequalification process that is as lean as possible without criteria that are disproportionately high; and


opportunities for all companies, including 
SMEs
 in particular, advertised as widely as possible - for example on the government’s Contracts Finder service.




4. Many of the recommendations contained in these reports have already been incorporated into the updated plans, but the government will respond to the task group reports in full in the autumn.

More than 2,000 miles of historic canals and rivers across England and Wales are being handed over to the Canal & River Trust today in a move to get communities more involved in their local waterways.


The new charity, whose patron is the Prince of Wales, will give the 10 million people who visit the waterways a greater role in making them cleaner and more beautiful than ever.


To mark its launch, the trust has unveiled its first appeal, 50 projects across the nation that will breathe new life into towpaths and riverbanks.  By pledging money or time people can get involved in projects such as creating new habitat for rare water voles, planting linear orchards for people and wildlife, and restoring neglected towpaths. 


The Canal & River Trust takes over from British Waterways and The Waterways Trust in England and Wales and represents a completely new approach to caring for the country’s waterways. The move, part of the Public Bodies Reform programme, is the largest single transfer of a public body into the charitable sector.


The government is helping the new charity get off to a great start by committing to a landmark, 15-year grant funding agreement as the bedrock to help the Trust maintain its waterways.  In addition, the Trust is funded through commercial income including money from its waterside property dowry, boat licences and moorings.


Minister for the Cabinet Office, Francis Maude, said:




This government is determined to deliver public services in different, better ways and that’s just what this new charity will do. The Canal & River Trust will empower the very people who know British canals and waterways the best to get involved in how they are run.  This is the Big Society in action - and because it’s also the largest single transfer of a public body into the charitable sector, it’s also a major milestone in our programme to reform quangos.

This government has an ambitious agenda to build a Big Society which will open up unprecedented new opportunities for civil society organisations to deliver public services and drive social action.


Minister for Civil Society Nick Hurd, said:




We are facing the largest peacetime deficit in our history and civil society cannot be immune from the necessary reductions in spending. The Big Society agenda will give charities, voluntary groups and social enterprises more opportunities to secure stable independent funding. But we recognise that this will not happen overnight.


To help address this problem, we have worked quickly to open a £100million short-term fund to help charities, voluntary groups and social enterprises make the transition to becoming providers to public of services, to work with us to build a Big Society and make the most of the opportunities it will bring for them.




Already public service reforms like supporting entrepreneurial front line public sector staff to form co-ops and mutuals to take over and run the services they provide as well as new Welfare to Work and Free Schools policies are increasing the diversity of civil society involvement.


The government is also developing a Big Society Bank that will use money from dormant bank accounts to help capitalise the sector and build capacity. This is on top of around £470million, including the £100million transition fund, announced in the spending review to directly support the sector. 


Peter Wanless, CEO of the BIG Lottery Fund, welcomed this new opportunity to support the sector:




BIG is delighted to be working with the OCS in administering this hugely important fund.  We will work with them to ensure that this money helps excellent organisations throughout England prepare effectively for the future.  We will be drawing on relevant expertise from ACEVO, and CapacityBuilders, among others, to achieve that.

The Big Society Bank will ensure that all the money from dormant bank accounts made available to England is put to good use for the benefit of society.  By expanding the social investment market place and helping to attract extra private sector investment it is expected that over time the Bank will generate hundreds of millions of pounds for charities, social enterprises and voluntary groups to fund social projects across the country, creating opportunities for social action and community involvement. As a wholesale organisation, the Bank will invest in financial intermediaries in the social investment market, who in turn will increase access to finance for frontline, social organisations.


The PM made the announcement to an audience of volunteers and social enterprise champions in Liverpool at the first in a series of planned Big Society events, alongside Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark.


He also announced the country’s first big society communities in Sutton, Windsor and Maidenhead, Eden Valley in Cumbria and Liverpool itself.


These 4 areas will now receive targeted and tailored help from the government to ensure they can overcome bureaucratic barriers and take greater responsibility for the decisions that affect the local area and local people.


Mr Maude said:




Today’s event shows just how much of a difference a stronger society, where people do more for each other, can make.


The funds from the dormant bank accounts will enable us to start stimulating activity where there is none and also help existing charities, social enterprises and community organisations to make changes in their local areas.


This is about a real cultural shift - we know that the era of big government, just tweaking things at the centre of power, didn’t work.  We want to build a Big Society where local people feel empowered to bring about the changes they know their communities need and they come together to change the things they care about.




Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:




Today, we are turning government upside down. Instead of imposing top-down diktats from Whitehall, we are asking people to tell us what they want to do to improve their lives. We will give communities the same support that we ministers have – people in government departments to sort out the bureaucracy that stands in their way.


No-one knows what’s needed in Liverpool, Sutton, Eden Valley and Windsor and Maidenhead better than the people who live there. That is the essence of the Big Society - trusting people to know what needs doing, with government enabling them instead of getting in their way.




The 4 Big Society communities have already expressed interest in areas including:




making budget decisions at street-level


taking over local assets such as a community pub


delivering broadband to local communities


piloting the government’s open-source planning reforms


taking responsibility for generating energy locally


deciding licensing rules locally


building a volunteer programme so they can keep local museums open for longer




The government is committed to give these communities all the support they need and is pledging the following measures:




a firm commitment to respond constructively to every request made by the big society communities for new rights and powers to take control of their cities, towns, villages and neighbourhoods


dedicated support from officials from the Department of Communities and Local Government to help the big society communities overcome and break down any barriers they encounter as they seek to take power and responsibility


a community organiser to help each community coordinate local support for, and involvement in, its plans




The government will continue to give new powers to neighbourhoods, including greater control over their finances and new rights to take over state-run services, and wants to hear from community groups and individuals who feel they are facing unreasonable barriers to making changes for the benefit of the local community.


Notes to editors




The Big Society Bank will be an independent wholesale organisation that will work and invest its funds through existing financial intermediaries like social investors and community lenders, who in turn will increase access to finance for frontline, social organisations.


As well as private sector investment, it will be funded by dormant bank accounts as enabled by the Dormant Bank Accounts Act. These are deposits of money in bank and building society accounts that people have lost track of or forgotten about over a period of time. The Big Society Bank will ensure that all the money from dormant bank accounts made available to England is put to good use for the benefit of society. 


The amount of funds available for distribution will be determined by the number of banks and building societies participating in the scheme, the success of the ongoing campaign to reunite individuals with their assets, and the sums held back for customer reclaim.


Our target is to establish the Bank by April 2011. A key milestone will be the creation of a Reclaim Fund to protect the interests of deposit holders, as required by the Dormant Bank Accounts Act. Co-operative Financial Services are currently in the process of submitting an application to the FSA to perform this role.


The four big society communities will be taking forward a range of ideas, which all come directly from proposals made by the people in those areas. They include:






moving a community centre to a site chosen by the community; building a renewable energy generation project; a community buy out of a local pub; providing community broadband access (Cumbria/Eden Valley)


transparency of local spending decisions; participatory budgeting for parks budget; delegating budgets to streets; devolving further powers to parishes (Windsor & Maidenhead)


boosting volunteering at a number of key museums; creating a social enterprise to produce films and content for digital platforms; developing neighbourhood media and cultural activities in poorer areas (Liverpool)


establishing greater freedom to implement sustainable transport schemes and influence the provision of local public transport; identifying ‘place shaping’ champions who can build good practice in greener living; supporting the creation of a project involving young people that invests in the local community (Sutton)

Early Intervention: Smart Investment, Massive Savings
.


The first report 
Early intervention: the next steps
 was published in January, it underlined that many of the costly and damaging social problems for individuals  can be eliminated or reduced by giving children and parents the right type of evidence based programmes 0-18 and especially in  their earliest years.


The second report sets out how we can pay for those programmes within existing resources and by attracting new non government money.


The key recommendations are that:




Government sets out as a policy objective that all babies, children and young people should have the social and emotional bedrock essential for their future development and their ability to make effective life choices


Government leadership and co-ordination must improve ,not least through an Early Intervention Task and Finish Group made up of experts from across Government departments which will establish ,measure and progress-chase Early Intervention outcomes


The expected “Families and the Foundation Stage” statement must include regular and purposeful assessments for the 0-5s to help spot and correct dysfunction early


An independent Early Intervention Foundation is set up to promote Early Intervention, spread best evidence based policies and complement the work being done inside government. The Prime Minister is called upon to challenge private, local and philanthropic sources to co-fund with government a  £20 million endowment  to sustain the Foundation


We must be more creative in bringing additional non-government money to investment in Early Intervention and that payment by results through outcome based contracts is promoted and funded from within existing budgets.


As part of building a social finance market we should establish an ‘Early Intervention Fund’ or Funds to raise around £200 million of private investment.


HM Treasury should commission a thorough review of Early Intervention growth incentives ahead of the 2012 Budget.




Graham Allen said:




The government has a great opportunity to not only talk the talk on Early Intervention but walk the walk too. There are no “magic bullets” in this report just a tough, practical guide to changing our spending culture from late intervention to early intervention, which has to be driven inside Whitehall by ministers and officials, and outside Whitehall by an independent Early Intervention Foundation.




Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said:




Every child should be helped to develop the necessary social and emotional skills that they need to form positive relationships, to have self-confidence and to perform to the best of their abilities at school.




“We have already done a great deal to reflect our commitment to early intervention. We are recruiting 4,200 health visitors and expanding programmes such as Family Nurse Partnerships. Through establishing the £2bn a year Early Intervention Grant, we have signalled the importance of this agenda. We have committed to maintain a network of Sure Start Children’s Centres and to expand the free offer of childcare to disadvantaged two year olds, and put in place measures like the Pupil Premium.  We are encouraging system reform through community budgets and payment by results.  This package will ensure that children get the best opportunities early on to help them succeed in their lives.  There is much innovative practice already emerging in many local areas - our challenge is how to build on that.


“Mr Allen makes a number of good and valuable recommendations. The government views these as a positive step forward and we will respond to them in due course.


Iain Duncan Smith, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions:




I warmly welcome this report and thank Graham for his valuable contribution and expertise to an area of policy that I think will become more important as we embark on our programme of reform. Getting Early Intervention right is crucial to breaking the inter-generational cycle of many of the social problems Britain is facing. By improving outcomes for children who have had a difficult start in life we can help them to meet their hopes and ambitions.




“Graham and I have worked together on this subject for many years and I am looking forward to seeing his proposals on social finance which opens the potential for investors, government and community organisations to work together.


 Oliver Letwin, Minister for Government Policy said:




The great power of Graham’s work is that it vividly illustrates the need to put more of our effort into solving problems early and cheaply, instead of spending vast sums trying (often vainly) to cure them later. Whether you measure this in terms of human happiness or in terms of taxpayer value, earlier is better.

It’s just an excuse and it is mindless.

A lot of people I know were discussing the violence over Facebook and other social networking sites last night, the majority being young people. I fear now that the minority are going to spoil it for the majority who are disgusted to see the destruction of neighbourhoods in our city.




Richmond Amoah, 16, who is doing 
NCS
 with youth volunteering charity v said:




What people have been doing in the riots is making the public look down on us. We’re planning a social action project working with homeless people. By doing something good like that we hope we can change the way communities think of youth and build their good will.




Nick Hurd, Minister for Civil Society said:




Thousands of young people on National Citizen Service are doing great work in communities across England. These young people come from all walks of life and I’ve seen them working together full of enthusiasm to help others. We have a wonderfully engaged and socially responsible generation of young people who deserve more credit than they get. I’m pleased to back their statement of shock at the riots and will continue to ensure that they have opportunities to make a positive difference.




Many of the young people taking part in

 today will be discussing what they can do to challenge people’s perception of young people as part of the social action projects they will all be developing.

 initiative which aims to help build a more cohesive, responsible and engaged society. It brings together 16-year-olds from different backgrounds to work together for the good of their communities while developing skills and confidence. Participants spend 2 weeks away from home taking part in outdoor team-based challenges before returning home to spend at least 30 hours working on community projects that they feel most strongly about. The scheme is being piloted this year with up to 10,000 places for young people across the country.

The government has strengthened proposals for a new individual register of voters to make the scheme simpler for the majority of voters. 


Following a period of consultation and pre-legislative scrutiny by the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee, Mark Harper, the Minister for Political and Constitutional Reform, today published updated proposals for Individual Electoral Registration that will improve the accuracy of the electoral register, make it harder to opt out, and make the transition to IER easier for most people. 


In order to make it easier for people to stay registered and in a bid to make the electoral register more complete and up to date, the government is proposing to use ‘data matching’ to retain up to two-thirds of those already on the electoral register.


Under the data matching process, an elector’s name and address would be compared against other public databases. If an individual’s details ‘matched’ then they would not have to take any action to remain on the register. This would create a floor in registration rates and allow the government to focus efforts and resources on those electors whose details could not be confirmed and those people who are currently not on the register.


The government has proposed the changes following consultation and pre-legislative scrutiny, and welcomed broad support for the principle of voters joining the electoral register individually rather than on a household basis.


Mark Harper said:




The coalition government has been clear from the start that the outdated system of household registration should end. Instead, voters should be registered individually so that we have a more accurate and complete register. Ultimately, it’s about empowering people to have their say in politics by voting.


I am grateful to the select committee and everyone who has taken part in the consultation process, and I am confident we now have a set of proposals behind which we can all unite.


In order to ensure that the electoral register is as complete and up to date as possible for the transition, the canvass scheduled for autumn 2013 will now take place in spring 2014.


The government believes registering to vote is a civic duty and we do not intend to create new offences to criminalise people who do not apply to register to vote.  We will retain the existing offence of refusing to provide information to an electoral registration officer when required to do so.  We acknowledge, however, that there is a debate to be had about the suggestion from some respondents that a civil penalty for not returning an IER form should be introduced, and we will work with stakeholders to further inform our thinking.




A command paper in response to the Select Committee’s report has been laid in Parliament today, and the government will introduce a Bill in due course.

The government’s original proposals were set out in the 
Individual Electoral Registration White Paper
 which was published on 30 June 2011.

9 percentage-point increase in regular volunteering


84% of people are satisfied with their local area


Nearly half of people want to be involved in local decision making


More people report a very strong sense of belonging to Britain




New figures released today show a sharp rise in volunteering and that people are actively coming together to drive improvements in their communities, Minister for Civil Society, Nick Hurd said today.


The Official Statistics published for the first time by the Cabinet Office show that the proportion of people volunteering at least once a year has now increased from 65% in 2010 to 2011 to 71% in 2012, with an even bigger increase in the proportion of people volunteering regularly. This equates to millions more people volunteering across the country  showing that the cultural change is not limited to the 120,000 who volunteered to make the Olympics a success. Significantly, this reverses the steady decline in volunteering seen since 2005.


The survey also reveals:




people are still giving generously to charity, with 74% making donations in 2012, compared with 72% in 2010


55% reported a very strong sense of belonging to Britain, an increase from 51% in 2010


a strong sense of community spirit, with 79% of people reporting they belong strongly to their neighbourhood


87% of people report that their local area is one where people from different backgrounds get along well together


nearly half of people want to be more involved in local decisions, a significant increase from 2010




Ministers believe that the figures are a vindication of their Big Society agenda to support people to get more involved in their communities. The government has backed a number of initiatives such as 
National Citizen Service
 for 16 and 17 year olds and the Olympic volunteering legacy programme 
Join In
 to engage a new generation in volunteering and civic engagement.


The statistics come on the same day the Prime Minister is launching a new drive to recruit one million volunteers to support people with dementia, in conjunction with the 
Alzheimer’s Society
.


The Prime Minister said:




We all want a bigger, stronger society where people do their bit and that’s why I am pleased that the Community Life Survey shows we are making progress. The figures show that millions more people are volunteering and that the British people remain incredibly generous with charitable giving.






We want to build on this success and make it easier for people who want to get involved. That’s why I am proud to be launching the effort today to get one million new volunteers trained to support people with dementia.




Minister for Civil Society Nick Hurd said:




These figures show a very positive picture of how well Britain has responded to tough times. We should take pride that so many people have helped reverse the decline in volunteering.






London 2012 showed what we can achieve through volunteering and we are determined to build on the inspiration of the games.




Programmes which the government is backing to encourage volunteering and social action include:




National Citizen Service - In 2011 over 8,000 young people took part in NCS, and in 2012 we expect the programme will have trebled in size, with 26,000 young people taking part. This equates to 700,000 hours of social action completed.


Join in, the Olympic legacy volunteering programme, delivered over 6,000 events across the UK, with over 300,000 people taking part.


Through the Social Action Fund the government has supported 40 charities with more than £20 million over two years so that they can recruit more volunteers. So far, over 100,000 volunteers have been recruited with 500,000 expected by Autumn 2013.


The government is investing an additional £40 million to support some of the most promising initiatives that use social action to help solve some of the thorniest social issues. The first of which will help recruit one million new volunteers to become ‘dementia friends’ bringing communities and individuals together to take responsibility in solving a critical problem.

Notes to editors




The Community Life Survey is a new survey commissioned by Cabinet Office to provide Official Statistics on issues that are key to encouraging social action and empowering communities, including volunteering, charitable giving, community engagement and well-being.


The Survey is representative of adults (aged 16+) in England. This first release covers data from Q2 2012-13, and is based on 2,262 interviews carried out between August to October 2012-13 by TNS-BMRB, on behalf of Cabinet Office.


The Survey is designed to be comparable with key measures on the previous Citizenship Survey so that trends can be tracked over time.  Where applicable, data from Community Life is compared with data from the 2010-11 Citizenship Survey.


Full findings, excel tables and survey outputs can be found at 
http://communitylife.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/
.


Join in, building on the Olympics, delivered over 6 000 events across the UK, with over 300,000 people taking part. Of those that took part, 10% volunteered on the day and over 10% signed up for future volunteering.  We are supporting Join in to continue to build on the success of 2013.


Community Organisers are well-trained and committed individuals who play a major role by listening to their communities they identify local leaders, projects and opportunities, and empower the local community to improve their local area. The work of the Organisers is independent of government, local authorities and charities, with local people setting the priorities and projects to take forward. The Organiser enables them to take action on the things that matter most to them.


Community First is an £80m government funded programme that will help communities come together through new and existing community groups to identify their strengths and local priorities, plan for their future and become more resilient.


So far the Community First Neighbourhood Matched Fund has leveraged 1.2m volunteering hours, by providing match funding for time, cash donations, and other resources contributed by communities towards social action projects in some of the most deprived communities in England.


The Government is supporting local charities with £30 million fund to help transform and modernise local charity support services. More than seventy partnerships of local support and development organisations across England have received grants to transform their services and provide high quality, joined up support to frontline charities. These projects will also make it easier for organisations to forge better links with local businesses, develop stronger partnerships with local public sector bodies and for people to volunteer.

Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander have commented on the meetings on 27 June ahead of the planned industrial action on 30 June.


They said: 




Today’s meeting was constructive and was just one of a series of ongoing talks the government has committed to with the TUC on public service pensions; further meetings have been scheduled for July. This is a genuine consultation to which we are committed in order to try and agree a way forward with the unions, including on how to implement the changes on contributions set out in the Spending Review. 




“We believe both sides have a responsibility to see the talks through and we would urge public workers not to strike while they are ongoing. 


“Public service pensions will still be among the very best, with a guaranteed pension which very few private sector staff now enjoy. We are proposing they will be paid later because people live longer, and that public sector staff will pay more, for a fairer balance between what they pay and what other taxpayers pay. 


“We recognise that the funding basis for the Local Government Pension Scheme is different. There are important implications for how the contributions and benefits interact, as both Lord Hutton and the Unions have set out. On that basis, we have agreed to have a more in depth discussion with local government unions and the TUC about how we take these factors into account. 


“While the talks are ongoing it is obviously disappointing that some unions have decided on industrial action. But what the recent ballot results show is that there is extremely limited support for the kind of strike action union leaders are calling for. Less than 10% of the Civil Service workforce has voted for strike actions and only about a third of teachers.


“We can assure the public now that we have rigorous contingency plans in place to ensure that their essential services are maintained during the strike action on Thursday.

On his first visit as Minister for Civil Society, Mr Hurd met with Jackie Rosenberg, Deputy CEO of the Paddington Development Trust and Steve Wyler, CEO of the Developments Trusts Association. This was followed by meeting local residents at Paddington Development Trust’s Enterprise Centre who were taking part in a workshop on setting up their own business.


After which Mr Hurd had a tour of Church Street neighbourhood centre where he met with the Trust’s neighbourhood team and local residents who together are delivering a range of improvements to their neighbourhood, including employment skills and attracting new businesses to the street market.


The Paddington Development Trust is a community-based social enterprise that was set up by local residents to support and empower people to come together to create positive change in their community.


The Trust runs 4 neighbourhood hubs in the area which bring together local residents and the main service providers, such as the Council and NHS, to work out solutions to local problems. It also acts as a social and community enterprise mentor for local organisations by providing business management advice and support, a youth training centre where young people can learn new skills and provide advice services on finance, healthcare and employment.


Mr Hurd, said:




The Paddington Development Trust is a great example of how a social enterprise can make a real difference to a community. The support, advice and services they provide are making a huge difference to people in their area.


As we announced earlier this week we have entered a new era of people power at the centre of the new government and it’s really exciting to see an organisation where this is already happening. Our Big Society agenda is all about empowering local people and communities to bring about the changes they know their community needs. By putting the power back in the hands of people we will enable them to come together and work together to makes things happen.




Deputy CEP of the Paddington Development Trust, Jackie Rosenberg, said:




Paddington Development Trust works because it has been driven over the last 10 years by the passion and commitment of local people who want to improve their own neighbourhoods. We work in some very deprived neighbourhoods where people need support to play their part in the Big Society. In effect, we make the Big Society bigger by making it a reality in challenging areas.




Earlier this week the government announced putting Big Society at the heart of public sector reform. The cross-government policy programme will create a climate that empowers local people and communities, building a Big Society that would roll back big government, bureaucracy and Whitehall power and includes supporting mutuals, co-operatives, charities and social enterprises and giving them greater involvement in the running of public services.


Funds from dormant bank accounts will also be used to establish a Big Society Bank, which will provide new finance for neighbourhood groups, charities, social enterprises and other non-governmental bodies.

Global Travel Taskforce sets out approach to safely restarting international travel


recommendations include launch of a new traffic light system and ‘green watchlist’, and the introduction of travel certification


government’s priority remains to protect the public and the vaccine rollout from international coronavirus (
COVID-19
) variants of concern






A 
framework to chart the safe return of international travel
 has been set out today (9 April 2021) by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps.


A traffic light system, which will categorise countries based on risk alongside the restrictions required for travel, will be set up to protect the public and the vaccine rollout from international 
COVID-19
 variants.


Key factors in the assessment will include:




the percentage of their population that have been vaccinated


the rate of infection


the prevalence of variants of concern


the country’s access to reliable scientific data and genomic sequencing




The report, produced by the 
Global Travel Taskforce
, shows how international travel could resume from 17 May 2021 at the earliest, in an accessible and affordable way. This includes the removal of the 
permission to travel form
 - meaning passengers would no longer need to prove they have a valid reason to leave the country.


The 
UK
 is a global leader in genome sequencing, which in positive cases allows the identification of variants of concern.


The risks posed by these variants remain significant, and restrictions for inbound passengers, such as 10-day managed quarantine, home quarantine, and stringent testing will remain in place - but will apply to people differently depending on whether the destination visited is categorised as ‘green’, ‘amber’ or ‘red’.






Green:
 arrivals will need to take a pre-departure test as well as a polymerase chain reaction (
PCR
) test on or before day 2 of their arrival back into England - but will not need to quarantine on return (unless they receive a positive result) or take any additional tests, halving the cost of tests on their return from holiday




Amber:
 arrivals will need to quarantine for a period of 10 days and take a pre-departure test, and a 
PCR
 test on day 2 and day 8 with the option for Test to Release on day 5 to end self-isolation early




Red:
 arrivals will be subject to [restrictions currently in place for ‘red list’ countries which include a 10-day stay in a managed quarantine hotel, pre-departure testing and 
PCR
 testing on day 2 and 8




Testing remains an essential part of protecting public health as restrictions begin to ease - with all arrivals who are not exempt required to book a pre-departure, day 2 and day 8 test before travelling.


Arrivals travelling from ‘red list’ countries should book a quarantine package before departure, and arrivals from ‘amber’ and ‘green’ countries will be required to book test packages before travelling from one of the government’s 
approved list of providers
.


Testing post-arrival remains an important tool in our wider measures to manage the risk of imported cases - allowing us to monitor positive tests and ensure people isolate, as well as identify and genomically sequence variants of concern.


We will also work with the travel industry and private testing providers ahead of international travel reopening, to see how we can further reduce the cost of travel for the British public, while ensuring travel is as safe as possible.


This could include cheaper tests being used when holidaymakers return home, as well as whether the government would be able to provide pre-departure tests.


It is too early to predict which countries will be on which list over the summer, and the government continues to consider a range of factors to inform the restrictions placed on them. We will set out by early May which countries will fall into which category, as well as confirming whether international travel can resume from 17 May 2021.


Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said:




International travel is vital – it boosts businesses and underpins the 
UK
 economy – but more than that, it brings people together, connects families who have been kept apart, and allows us to explore new horizons.


The framework announced today will help allow us to reopen travel safely and sustainably, ensure we protect our hard-won achievements on the vaccine roll out, and offer peace of mind to both passengers and industry as we begin to take trips abroad once again.




We will also play a leading role in the development of international standards around a digital travel certification system. The Department for Transport (
DfT
) is working across government to consider the role certification could play in facilitating outbound travel, for those countries which have systems in place. Work also continues to develop a system that would facilitate travel certification for inbound international travel.


To give passengers more certainty when travelling, a ‘green watchlist’ will be introduced to help identify countries most at risk of moving from ‘green’ to ‘amber’. The watchlist will provide greater assurance for those who wish to travel abroad.


While the watchlist will warn travellers of potential changes in advance, the government will not hesitate to act immediately should the data show that countries risk ratings have changed.


The allocation of countries will be kept under review and respond to emerging evidence, with a particular focus on variants of concern.


Restrictions will be formally reviewed on 28 June 2021 to take account of the domestic and international health picture, and to see whether current measures could be rolled back. Further formal reviews will take place at checkpoints no later than 31 July and 1 October 2021.


To ensure our borders remain safe and efficient when passenger flows increase, the government has also announced plans to digitise the 
passenger locator form
, integrating it into our border system and enabling checks to take place at e-gates by autumn 2021.


To further boost consumer confidence, the Civil Aviation Authority (
CAA
) will be given additional enforcement powers to act on airlines that have breached consumer rights - with a dedicated consultation on how to use additional tools to enforce consumer rights expected later this year.


A 
COVID-19
 charter will also be introduced from 17 May 2021, clearly setting out what is required of passengers and what their rights are while measures remain in place.

The taskforce has already saved £5 million for taxpayers by reducing fraud and error since 2010.


This interim report is early work  - the government’s new approach to tackle debt will be set out in a final report in summer 2012, and will be focused on prevention and fairness.

Statement from Minister for the Cabinet Office, Francis Maude, on the result of the PCS ballot. 


The Minister for the Cabinet Office, Francis Maude, said: 




What today’s ballot result shows is that among PCS members there is extremely limited support for the kind of strike action their leaders want.  There was a very low turnout for this ballot and less than 20% of their members are supporting this unnecessary industrial action.




“This is not surprising given that talks with the TUC about public sector pensions are continuing; there is no justification for any civil servant going on strikes while discussions are continuing.   


“There is cross party consensus that public sector pensions need to be made fairer and more sustainable. That is what former Minister John Hutton’s report recommended and that is what we are trying to achieve.


“Public sector pensions will remain among the very best, providing a guaranteed pension level for all employees. Today very few private sector employers still offer guaranteed pension levels. 


“But people today are living much longer. So Lord Hutton recommended that people should work for longer before drawing their pension.


“And we’re asking employees to pay more towards the cost of their pension. This makes for a fairer balance between what employees pay and what other taxpayers have to pay.  


“We continue to hope that industrial action will not take place, but in the unfortunate event that it does we can assure the public now that all services have highly developed and rigorous contingency plans.

The appointment marks a significant change to government procurement and paves the way for a radical transformation of how government manages the procurement of common goods and services.


The Chief Procurement Officer will be responsible for delivering the government’s goal of centralising procurement. He will ensure that the Crown receives the best value for money by acting as a single customer, rather than separate departments, when buying commonly used goods and services, such as energy and office supplies.


John Collington was, until now, the Head of Procurement in the Cabinet Office 
Efficiency and Reform Group
. As Chief Procurement Officer, he will be responsible for the delivery of more efficient procurement across Government and improving procurement capability.


The need for government to be more efficient was highlighted in October 2010, by 
Sir Philip Green’s Efficiency Review
, which found that government had failed to make the most of its scale, buying power and credit rating. In addition to his existing responsibilities, he will take on responsibility for the transformation and operational delivery of the Government’s procurement agency, Buying Solutions.


Francis Maude also announced today that David Smith, Commercial Director at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), will additionally take on the role of Deputy Chief Procurement Officer for Government. David will take on the role alongside his current responsibilities at DWP.


David was last week also appointed a Crown Representative, responsible for managing relationships with some of Government’s key suppliers. The Crown Representatives will manage delivery of the cost savings agreed through the renegotiation of contracts with key suppliers, as government seeks to achieve better value by acting as a single customer. The renegotiation of key contracts has saved the government £800m so far since May 2010.


Francis Maude said:




I am delighted that John Collington has agreed to take on the position of Chief Procurement Officer.  This new role will allow him to drive real transformation in government procurement, which in turn will realise significant savings for the taxpayer.




John Collington said: 




It is both an honour and privilege to be appointed as government’s first Chief Procurement Officer. I look forward to working with David and my other commercial and procurement colleagues across Government in delivering our ambitious plans to transform government procurement.




Notes to editors




The Chief Procurement Officer is a new position based within the Efficiency and Reform Group in the Cabinet Office and will report to the Chief Operating Officer, Ian Watmore. The role merges two existing positions of Head of Procurement in the Cabinet Office and Chief Executive of Buying Solutions, with a consequent saving to the taxpayer. 


John Collington joined the Efficiency and Reform Group in September 2010 as Head of Procurement. Before that, he was Group Commercial Director of the Home Office with responsibility for transforming how the Department manages its annual £2.4 billion expenditure on goods and services. Before joining Government in 2007, John spent 23 years in the private sector in a number of senior commercial and supply chain roles operating on a global basis.


The full team of 
Crown Representatives
 was announced on 13 April 2011.


The common commodity goods and services to be procured centrally include energy, office solutions, professional services, travel, fleet, learning and development, ICT commodities, advertising and media, print and print management.


Sir Philip Green was appointed by the Prime Minister to review Government efficiency.  The review was overseen by Francis Maude and Danny Alexander. Sir Philip’s 
findings and recommendations
 were published on 11 October 2010.

MyCSP Ltd, the first ‘John Lewis style’ business created from a central government service was launched today by Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office. MyCSP Ltd’s innovative Mutual Joint Venture model gives employees a 25% ownership stake, representation at board level and a share in profits. The new enterprise will be contracted by the Government to administrate pensions for the 1.5million members of the Civil Service scheme. It will cut costs for taxpayers, reaching annual savings of 50% by 2022, while improving the service.


The Equiniti Group’s Paymaster business has been announced as the winner of the hotly contested tender to join the venture with a 40% stake. Paymaster brings business expertise and capital investment. The Government retains a 35% stake so taxpayers benefit as the business grows in value.


Francis Maude also announced today that former Cabinet Minister, Lord Hutton of Furness, will be the first Chairman of MyCSP Ltd. As such, Lord Hutton takes a leading role in the Government’s plan to hand greater ownership, responsibility and power to the people running public services. Mark Lund, the former Chief Executive of St. James’s Place Capital PLC, will Chair the MyCSP Ltd Employee Partnership Trust charged with protecting the employees’ interests.


Francis Maude said:




We no longer face a binary choice between public services delivered by state monopoly and straight privatisation. That is why I am a passionate supporter of mutuals which will help Britain grow a more diverse economy.


As a mutual, MyCSP will deliver better services for its pension scheme members, millions of pounds of savings for the taxpayer and a real sense of ownership for employees over what they do.


We are transforming a neglected back-office operation into a new competitive and responsible business - the rest of the world is watching.


Lord Hutton brings a real wealth of experience to his role as Chairman and I’m delighted he has accepted this role.




Lord Hutton, Chairman of MyCSP, said:




I am a firm believer in the power of engaging employees to drive innovation. MyCSP Ltd builds a powerful partnership that will drive up standards and reduce costs. Providing a high quality service to scheme members will be vital to ensuring they never lose sight of the true value of their pension. I am proud to accept a role in this ambitious project.




Paul Bingham, Managing Director of the Equiniti Group’s Paymaster business said: 




The mutual model is a great idea, with a great future, and one which Equiniti Group is excited to be part of. Our experience looking after 2.9 million pension scheme members and working with more than half of the FTSE 100 makes us the ideal private sector partner in this ground breaking arrangement.  We share the same desire as MyCSP to offer a fantastic service to customers and to make our mutual joint venture a template for others to come - a focus which will make this business a commercial success.




Stephen Kelly, former CEO of successful FTSE and NASDAQ companies was today appointed as the Government’s nominated Board Director, said:




With Lord Hutton’s leadership I have complete confidence that My CSP will succeed. The mutual joint venture model can open up employee ownership as an option for thousands of public services which would simply not be viable as a traditional mutual. Forming partnerships with the private sector can give mutuals the capital backing and business expertise they need to thrive and grow. This means more benefit from the improved productivity and customer satisfaction mutuals are proven to generate.




Phil Bartlett, CEO of MyCSP Ltd, said:




The launch of MyCSP Ltd is an extraordinary achievement and paves the way to meeting the challenges, and grasping the opportunities that lie ahead. We have a lot of work to do but for the first time we have the backing and resources to build the excellent service that we’ve always aspired to. I welcome Paymaster to our new partnership and thank the employee partners who have over the last year delivered real improvements despite the pressures of reform.




MyCSP Ltd is a pathfinder at the cutting-edge of public service reform. Such innovations are vital to protecting frontline services while helping to bring public spending back under control. A diverse and innovative marketplace will increase competition and outcomes. Research shows that competitively tendering public services typically produces between 10% and 30% savings, while maintaining or improving standards.


Pioneering better business models, such as the Mutual Joint Venture, is critical to keeping Britain’s public service industry ahead of global competition. Growing demand for public services in economies such as China, India and Brazil, will create significant new opportunities in a market which British businesses lead. In 2010, the UK public administration, education and health industry sector balance of trade switched from a deficit of £154 million in 2009 to a surplus of £304 million.


MyCSP Ltd is the first central government mutual but many already operate successfully in the wider public sector. Over £1billion of health services are provided by mutuals. Evidence suggests that employee ownership can boost productivity by up to 19%. John Lewis, one of Britain’s best known mutuals, continually tops customer satisfaction polls and has half the average staff turnover and sickness absence of the retail sector. The Government is supporting public servants who want to form mutuals with a £10million Mutuals Support Programme and

a report published
 by Professor Julian Le Grand and the Mutuals Taskforce, finds. The report recommends actions to make this burgeoning movement a mainstream option for public service delivery.


The Mutuals Taskforce, chaired by Professor Le Grand, and formed of leading experts in public policy, employee ownership and business, has examined the barriers facing public servants who form mutual businesses and take control of their services. Its recommendations include:




exemptions from EU procurement regulations for new mutuals


implementing Rights to Provide, with clear pathways and appeals processes


training and guidance for public service commissioners


analysis of investment opportunities in mutuals by Big Society Capital




Professor Julian Le Grand, Chair of the Mutuals Taskforce, said:




This is no utopian fantasy. Mutuals deliver higher quality services at lower cost to tax-payers. So it’s with some jubilation that I can report a movement, led by truly entrepreneurial public servants, has taken root and is growing. But we simply cannot rely on there being enough exceptional leaders to make this a mainstream delivery option. The path to mutualisation must be made easier.


Public service mutuals develop differently to other SMEs, often becoming businesses overnight. This must be reflected in new regulation, new investment and greater support. But, most importantly, we are calling for change inside the public sector. The will to develop mutuals and improve public services is there at the very top of government and on the frontline. But too often there is a gulf in the middle where risk-averse managers, ignorant of the benefits, impede progress. 




Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office, said:




Frontline staff are the real experts: they know what’s important to the people they help every day. Forming a mutual lets them focus on local needs with less bureaucratic interference. It’s no surprise that as more services mutualise we are seeing real benefits.


I want to thank all the members of the Mutuals Taskforce for these recommendations.


We will now consider how to take the recommendations forward but in particular I am already aware of the problems with EU procurement regulations and will push for reform.




The report shows that since 2010 the number of public service mutuals has increased from 9 to at least 58 with a some 40 projects in the pipeline. In the same time, the services in which mutuals are developing has diversified from 4 (health, social work, education and leisure) to 12 (including fire services, housing and libraries).


The report analyses some of the emerging evidence from mutuals and finds improvements to the conditions and well-being of staff, as well as improvements to service quality, efficiency and effectiveness.


Improved staff well-being can be evidenced by reductions in sickness absence. Since spinning-out in April 2011, Essex Community Services have reduced the average number of sickness days by approximately 2 days per employee. This pattern is backed up by what staff say. In Central Surrey Health, 98% of co-owners are willing to go beyond what is normally required, well above the 84% industry norm.


There are also numerous examples of improved services and greater efficiency. Hull City Health Care Partnership involved all their staff in an efficiency exercise which saved £600,000. At the same time, they have improved patient satisfaction with 85% rating their service ‘Excellent’ or ‘Very Good’, an improvement of 7% since they spun-out in 2009.

Nine in ten civil servants are interested in their work and more than three-quarters work with their team to find ways to improve the service they provide, according to the results of the 2011 Civil Service People Survey published today.


The Survey, the largest staff attitude survey in the UK, received almost 300,000 responses - a response rate of 60%. The overall employee engagement rate stood at 56%, unchanged from 2010.


The benchmark score for most of the other themes in the survey has remained unchanged, although there are small positive increases in the leadership and managing change theme. Only one theme, pay and benefits, has seen a decrease in the benchmark score.


Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office said:




This is not an easy time for civil servants, but their work is absolutely vital in helping to address the deficit without hitting the services the public receive. I am proud of the work they have done to make efficiency savings and it is a tribute to them that they have maintained their focus and commitment throughout, a fact borne out by this survey.




Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O’Donnell said:




This has been a year of change for the civil service, yet today’s results show that civil servants across the country remain positive about the task ahead. I am particularly pleased that so many remain committed to the fundamental purpose and objectives, which is reflected in the hard work and dedication we see every day.




The Civil Service is committed to measuring the engagement levels of staff, and the factors which influence and drive engagement, so that managers have the best information available to motivate their staff. Effective employee engagement is a crucial component of improving performance, driving efficiency and reducing sickness absence.


Running a single survey across the Civil Service rather than separate surveys in each Department and Agency has lead to a reduction in the cost of staff survey activity to just 38 per cent of what the Civil Service paid for separate surveys in 2008/9.

The Civil Service Staff Survey is available online at:

People will be given more choice to shape the public services they use, putting control in the hands of individuals and neighbourhoods so everyone can benefit from the best public services available, announced the Prime Minister today.




Open Public Services White Paper


Open Public Services website


Statement to Parliament on Open Public Services




While some of our public services lead the way, it’s clear that in many areas, they have not kept pace with people’s lifestyles and expectations, with a ‘get what you’re given’ culture too often prevailing. Building on progress already taking place in areas like schools, welfare, health and policing, the Open Public Services White Paper turns that culture on its head. And recognising that Whitehall does not know best, it begins a programme of consultation and engagement over the summer with individuals, communities, public sector staff and providers to ensure that the improvements are both ambitious and practical.


Speaking at Reform, the Prime Minister said:




I know what our public services can do and how they are the backbone of this country. But I know too that the way they have been run for decades - old-fashioned, top-down, take-what-you’re-given - is just not working for a lot of people.”Ours is a vision of open public services - there will be more freedom, more choice and more local control. Wherever possible we are increasing choice by giving people direct control over the services they use.




The five core principles for modernising public services are:






Wherever possible government will increase choice

This means giving people more direct control over the services they use, for example through personal budgets in healthcare. People will be given the power to choose where they send their children to school or which hospital they receive treatment in.




Public services should be de-centralised to the lowest appropriate level

This means giving communities more control over public services, for example by giving neighbourhood councils the chance to run the community library or local football pitch, or take control over local road improvements. We will make it easier for people to set up neighbourhood councils where they don’t already exist.




Public services should be open to a range of providers

These providers could be in the public, private or voluntary sectors. For example, in education the government is opening up services by expanding the Academies programme and introducing Free Schools to drive up standards. And we will tackle not just failing schools but coasting ones as well, ensuring that there is continuous improvement.




Fair access

The government recognises that not all people start from the same point and believe the state needs to provide extra help to those individuals who have been previously left behind. For example, the government has introduced pupil premium in schools, funding for community organisers in the poorest areas and 15 hours a week pre-school education for the poorest two year olds in the country.




Public services should be accountable to users and to taxpayers

All public services need to be accountable to the people who use them and the taxpayers who pay for them. Payment by results is one of the methods of increasing this kind of accountability, as is happening now in the Work Programme, a revolutionary new approach to supporting people back to work.




Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said:




This is an important milestone in the government’s mission to make public services better for the people that use them. This paper alone won’t change people’s lives, but the principles it sets out will shape and improve the public services people use for generations to come. It will give people more choice, make services fairer, devolve power from the centre and make services more accountable to the people that use them.




Minister for Government Policy Oliver Letwin said:




For far too long, far too many people have had to make do with what they’ve been given, with only the better off being able to choose something else if the state let them down. That won’t be allowed to continue. We will allow people to choose the services that are right for them - the right schools for their children, the right hospital when they’re ill, and the right services for their neighbourhoods.




These principles are already being applied to public services - in particular in education and welfare. In the past year alone, for example, more than 1000 schools have applied to become academies and 20 groups of public sector employees have opted to create their own new public service ventures. The government recognises that the changes necessary to modernise public services will not happen over night. Many of the policies will require detailed design, and engaging professionals and the wider public is critical to getting it right. This White Paper is open for consultation and we will soon commence a wide-range of discussions with individuals, communities, providers and public sector workers.

Cabinet Office Parliamentary Secretary Chloe Smith joined Paralympian Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson at the House of Commons on Monday, October 22, to celebrate the launch of Energy Club, a Cabinet Office-backed physical activity scheme for children aged between 4-11 years old.


Energy Club is a volunteer movement initiated by the charity and social enterprise Sports Leaders UK, supported by a £900,000 grant from the Cabinet Office’s Social Action Fund.


Energy Club will provide a lasting legacy from the Olympic and Paralympic Games by tackling the increasingly sedentary lives of young children which currently sees 23% of 4-5 year olds overweight or obese as they enter primary school, rising to 33.3% as the children reach 10-11 years old. Energy Club provides fun, free activity sessions, which include healthy eating and nutrition information, led by a trained volunteer force.


Volunteers will be parents and members of school networks, including young adults and volunteers from major corporations, who will receive training, on-going support, guidance and equipment.


The Social Action Fund has been created to support the government’s vision for a Big Society by funding proposals that will embed long term increases in giving. The funding is enabling established and proven models of social action to scale up and grow, creating new opportunities for people across the country to make a difference in their communities.


Cabinet Office Parliamentary Secretary Chloe Smith said:




We’re using the Social Action Fund to support projects like Energy Club which can help build a bigger, stronger society. By bringing schools, parents and businesses together in this fantastic project, Energy Club will help keep the legacy of the London 2012 Games alive by ensuring more children can benefit from a healthy, physically active lifestyle.




Sports Leaders UK President and Paralympian Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson said:




Energy Club is an exciting opportunity as our country moves forward from a fantastic summer of sport. This scheme builds on the great volunteer movement we saw during the Games to provide schools with free club activities; physical activity improves children’s health and wellbeing, academic performance, behaviour, self-esteem and weight management - and we’re taking action before sedentary behaviours become set. Our belief is that kids are built to have fun being physically active - it’s just that these days they need a little more help. I would encourage schools, parents and volunteers alike to get involved with this great movement.




Linda Plowright, CEO of Sports Leaders UK said:




Energy Club is about mobilising a new group of volunteers to get our kids having fun, and getting active. It is different because it takes the people who care most about kids, gives them training and support, so they can make a difference in their local community. This is about communities taking social action and I urge anyone interested in signing up their school, or who wants to know how they can train to become a volunteer, to visit our website and fill in their contact details. This is an exciting time to help get our kids, and their families’ active after the success of London 2012 and we want as many people as possible to be involved.

From April 2013, the Government intends to introduce binding new rules on both the Health & Safety Executive and on local authorities, that will exempt hundreds of thousands of businesses from burdensome health & safety inspections.


In future, businesses will only be inspected if they are operating in high risk areas, such as construction, or if they have a poor record.


The Government will also change the law next month so companies will only be liable for civil damages in health and safety cases if they can be shown to have acted negligently.


This will end the current situation where businesses can automatically be liable for damages even if they were not actually negligent.


This commitment constitutes the most ambitious action ever proposed by a modern British government to slash the burden of regulation and set businesses free. It will save British companies millions of pounds in wasted time and money, and help spur economic growth and innovation across the UK.


Business Secretary Vince Cable said:


“We are delivering a number of reforms across the economy to deliver on our top priority - strong and sustainable growth.


“Removing unnecessary red tape and putting common sense back into areas like health and safety will reduce fears and costs for businesses. We want to help give British business the confidence it needs to create more jobs and support the wider economy to grow.”


The Government is also taking radical action on red tape in a further measure to boost growth and jobs in the economy. It is systematically examining some 6,500 substantive regulations that it inherited through the Red Tape Challenge process.


The Government is now committing to abolish or substantially reduce at least 3,000 of these regulations and it will complete the identification of the regulations to be scrapped or overhauled by December 2013.


Business Minister Michael Fallon said:


“Cutting red tape shows the Government is serious about helping businesses to flourish. We’re getting out of the way by bringing common sense back to health and safety.


“And we will be holding departments’ feet to the fire to ensure all unnecessary red tape is cut, and we can boost the jobs and growth that our economy needs.”

billions to support businesses and families through the pandemic


investment-led recovery as UK emerges from lockdown


future changes to strengthen public finances




Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said his immediate priority continues to be supporting those hardest hit, with extensions to furlough, self-employed support, business grants, loans and VAT cuts – bringing total fiscal support to over £407 billion.


He also set out plans to drive jobs, growth and investment to help the economy rebound - and spoke honestly about the tough choices required to put the public finances on a more sustainable path.


Delivering the budget in Parliament Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said:




This Budget meets the moment with a three-part plan to protect the jobs and livelihoods of the British people.


First, we will continue doing whatever it takes to support the British people and businesses through this moment of crisis.


Second, once we are on the way to recovery, we will need to begin fixing the public finances – and I want to be honest today about our plans to do that.


And, third, in today’s Budget we begin the work of building our future economy.




Protecting jobs and livelihoods


In line with the government’s roadmap for the cautious easing of social distancing rules, the Chancellor pledged to keep economic support in place until we are out of lockdown.


To protect the livelihoods of those hardest hit, the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme will be extended to September and the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) will continue with a fourth and a fifth grant. The Chancellor announced that more than 600,000 people, many of whom became self-employed in 2019-20, may now be able to claim direct cash grants under SEISS.


In addition, the business rates holiday in England has been extended by an additional three months. That means 750,000 retail, hospitality and leisure properties in England will pay no business rates for three months from 1 April when combined with Small Business Rates Relief, with further relief available for the rest of the year.


To continue supporting the 150,000 businesses in the tourism and hospitality sectors and to protect 2.4 million jobs, the government has extended the temporary 5% reduced rate of VAT until 30 September 2021. To help businesses manage the transition back to the standard rate, a 12.5% rate will then apply for a further six months, until 31 March 2022.


Grant funding will be available to businesses in England through a new £5 billion Restart Grant scheme to help the high street, providing up to £18,000, bringing the total spent on business grants to £25 billion.


A new Recovery Loan Scheme will also be launched to replace the existing government guaranteed schemes which have supported £73 billion of lending to date and close at the end of March.


To maintain momentum for the Covid-19 vaccination programme, the Budget will inject an extra £1.65 billion to ensure the roll-out in England continues to be a success and invest a further £50 million to boost the UK’s vaccine testing capability.


As part of the UK Government’s Plan for Jobs to support, protect and create jobs, the Chancellor is increasing support with £126 million of new money to enable 40,000 more traineeships, and doubling the cash incentive to firms who take on an apprentice to a £3,000 payment per hire. The National Living Wage will be increased to £8.91 from April and there will also be a six-month extension of the £20 per week Universal Credit uplift, with eligible Working Tax Credit claimants receiving a one-off payment of £500.


A new mortgage guarantee scheme will enable homebuyers to secure a mortgage up to £600,000 with a 5% deposit, and an extension to the temporary cut in Stamp Duty Land Tax to September will support the housing market and protect and create jobs.


£700 million will support the UK’s arts, culture and sporting institutions as they reopen, backing the UK and Ireland’s joint bid to host the World Cup in 2030.


To put more money in the public’s pocket, fuel duty will be frozen for the 11th consecutive year and there will be a freeze in duty rates for beer, cider, wine and spirits.


Strengthening the public finances


The Chancellor was honest with the public about the need to get public finances back on track and give people and businesses the certainty they need for the future while not raising rates of income tax, national insurance or VAT.


Income tax personal allowance and the higher rate threshold will rise next year as planned and will then be maintained at that level until April 2026. Nobody’s take home pay will be less than it is now, and the UK’s allowances remain the most generous of any G20 country.


To balance the need to raise revenue with the objective of having an internationally competitive tax system, the rate of Corporation Tax will increase to 25%, which will remain the lowest rate in the G7. In order to support the recovery, the increase will not take effect until 2023. Businesses with profits of £50,000 or less, around 70% of actively trading companies, will continue to be taxed at 19%. A tapered rate will also be introduced for profits above £50,000, so that only businesses with profits of £250,000 or greater will be taxed at the full 25% rate.


An investment-led recovery


The Budget will spread investment and opportunity across the UK, helping businesses to grow, and improving access to skills, capital and ideas.


New English Freeports will be based in East Midlands Airport, Felixstowe & Harwich, Humber, Liverpool City Region, Plymouth, Solent, Thames and Teesside and will be special economic zones with different rules to make it easier and cheaper to do business. Combined with changes to immigration rules, the Towns Fund, the UK-wide Levelling Up Fund, and the UK Community Renewal Fund, opportunities for well-paid jobs, innovation and growth will be leveled up across the country.


The Budget also coincides with the publication of the the government’s new Build Back Better: our plan for growth strategy, setting out how infrastructure, skills and innovation will drive the UK economy.


130,000 small and medium sized businesses will be supported through the new Help to Grow scheme, providing the digital and management tools needed to innovate, grow and help drive recovery.


Beginning April 2021, a new super-deduction will cut companies’ tax bill by 25p for every pound they invest in new equipment meaning they can reduce their taxable profits by 130% of the cost. This is worth £25 billion to companies over the two-year period the super-deduction will be in full effect.


And to help progress the Prime Minister’s ambitious Ten Point Plan for a green industrial revolution, new port infrastructure will be built to support the next generation of offshore wind projects in Teesside and Humberside. The UK will issue at least £15 billion in green bonds to help finance the transition to net zero and the government will launch the world’s first sovereign green savings bond for retail investors.


Support for the whole UK


Many of today’s announcements such as the extension of job support schemes and VAT cut will directly benefit people across the UK.


In addition, this budget provides an additional £2.4 billion to the devolved administrations in 2021-22 through the Barnett formula.






the Scottish Government will benefit from a £1.2 billion funding boost






the Welsh Government a £740 million funding boost






the Northern Ireland Executive a £410 million funding boost

If you want to donate money, there are a number of charities providing humanitarian relief in Turkey and Syria.




Donate to the Disasters Emergency Committee Turkey-Syria earthquake appeal
.




The UK government matched, pound-for-pound, £5 million of public donations to this appeal.


Make your donation safely


There are lots of organisations across the UK and internationally who have launched appeals, and you may wish to donate through these organisations instead. Charities with experience of responding to disasters are best placed to reach victims on the ground.


There are some simple steps you can take to ensure your money is safe and being used effectively:




check the charity’s name and registration number using the 
search the charity register tool




most charities with an income of £5,000 or more must be registered, which means they are regulated by 
The Charity Commission




make sure the charity is genuine before giving any financial information


if in doubt, ask the charity or organisation for more information




Donating essential supplies


One of the best ways to help is by donating cash through trusted charities and aid organisations, rather than donating goods. Cash can be transferred quickly to areas where it is needed and individuals and aid organisations can use it to buy what is most needed.


Unsolicited donations of goods, although well-meant, can obstruct supply chains and delay more urgent life-saving assistance from getting through. If you wish to donate goods, check with charities and community groups. They will have lists of items they need.

The contract was split into two-year sections, with LLWR retaining the option to proceed with the second half of the deal, based on performance.


Family-owned GRAHAM Construction was awarded the four-year Framework by LLWR in late 2014, and the two organisations have since formed a single integrated team to work on a series of major programmes and projects, including Security Enhancement, Repository Development and Site Infrastructure improvements.


Paul Pointon, LLWR’s Head of Site, said:




The signing of this contract extension is a measure of the confidence we have in GRAHAM Construction to continue to carry out extensive works on our site over the next two years.


The single team approach is working well and producing results and I want to thank all involved for their efforts. We expect the relationship between the two organisations to flourish over the next two years, building on the experience gained in the past two years.




GRAHAM Construction is based in Northern Ireland but has worked tirelessly to integrate into the West Cumbrian community.


Earlier this year it had 44 employees working on the Framework, 32 of who were local. An estimated 83 people were also supported through sub-contracting, 90% of which were Small to Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs).


With LLWR support, GRAHAM has also developed 3 STEM ambassadors to work in schools, supported Drigg Gala Day and visited many schools and colleges to talk about the benefits of engineering.


Stuart Robertson, of GRAHAM Construction, said:




We are delighted that the relationship with LLWR is going from strength-to-strength.


There is much to achieve over the next two years, but working closely with LLWR I’m sure we will continue to produce results.

Neil Fawcett, GRAHAM Project Manager, said:




No one should underestimate the amount of effort and time that has gone into receiving this recognition.


We will not just stop still as we know that we can still do more. We are within reaching distance of receiving an even higher award and we will continue to do our best to ensure we deliver the best for LLWR and the wider community.

The UK government will extend measures to prevent high street businesses facing eviction over summer


New code provides support to shops and local firms planning their future recovery with their landlord


Industry leaders back code and welcome measures to support affected businesses






The UK government has extended measures to prevent struggling companies from eviction over the summer.


The extension, until the end of September, comes alongside further support to help local businesses plan for economic recovery following the coronavirus pandemic.  


A new 
code of practice
 has been developed with leaders from the retail, hospitality and property sectors to provide clarity for businesses when discussing rental payments and to encourage best practice so that all parties are supported.


These interventions are in addition to the comprehensive financial package provided by the UK government to businesses during this difficult time and is in recognition of the strain that the sector is currently under.


The code is voluntary for businesses and is relevant to all commercial leases held by businesses in any sector which have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. 


It encourages tenants to continue to pay their rent in full if they are in a position to do so and advises that others should pay what they can, whilst acknowledging that landlords should provide support to businesses if they too are able to do so.


The suspension of the forfeiture of evictions will come as a relief in particular to pubs, cafes and restaurants, after the hospitality sector called upon the government for action in this area.


Communities Secretary, Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:




As our high streets come to life and our town centres open for business, it is crucial that both landlords and tenants have clarity and reassurance as they seek to keep their finances stable and bounce back.


That is why we are extending measures to protect those who are unable to pay rent from eviction so that businesses have the security they need to plan for their futures.


And in recognition of the strain that the virus has had on our high streets, our new code, backed by leaders across the industry, will help unlock conversations on rent and future payments whilst ensuring best practice is displayed across the board as we confront the challenges of this pandemic.




Business Secretary Alok Sharma MP said:




From clothes stores to our local book shop, we want as many high street businesses as possible to emerge from the pandemic, in the best position to bounce back.


During this particularly challenging time for businesses, our retail stores are safely welcoming shoppers back and taking the necessary steps to drive economic recovery.


By putting a stop to unreasonable evictions, these measures will protect jobs and provide further flexibility to our high street businesses that were trading successfully before the COVID-19 emergency, so they can focus on continuing to deliver for their customers and communities.




Across the UK, the code will encourage tenants and landlords to be transparent in their discussions and to act reasonably and responsibly whilst recognising the impact that coronavirus has had on businesses’ finances. 


The UK government has confirmed the following changes to the existing package of measures for the commercial sector:




We will lay a statutory instrument to amend the Coronavirus Act to extend the time period for suspension of the forfeiture of evictions from June 30 to September 30, meaning no business will be forced out of their premises if they a miss a payment in the next three months.


We will also lay secondary legislation to prevent landlords using Commercial Rent Arrears Recovery unless they are owed 189 days of unpaid rent. The time period for which this measure is in force will be extended from June 30 to September 30. 


An amendment to the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Bill has been tabled which will extend the temporary ban on the use of statutory demands and winding-up petitions where a company cannot pay its bills due to coronavirus until 30 September.




UK Finance has also 
confirmed
 its members’ continued support for commercial landlord customers including amendments to facilities and capital payment holidays.


The UK government’s financial package of measures to support businesses during the economic emergency includes:




A Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme where small and large employers can  apply for a government grant of 80% of workers’ salaries up to £2,500 a month. The scheme will be backdated to 1 March 2020 and available for at least 3 months, with first grants to be paid within weeks.


Deferral of the next quarter of VAT payments for firms, until the end of June - representing a £30 billion injection into the economy.


£330 billion worth of government backed and guaranteed loans to support businesses. 


A Bounce Back Loans scheme, providing loans of up to £50,000 to benefit small businesses with a 100% government-backed guarantee for lenders. These loans will be interest free for the first 12 months and businesses can apply online through a short and simple form. 


A Self-Employed Income Support Scheme to help eligible freelance workers receive up to £2,500 per month in grants for at least 3 months.

.


It was developed and coordinated by the UK government alongside a working group of the following, who have all endorsed the code; British Chambers of Commerce, British Property Federation, British Retail Consortium, the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council, Revo, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and UKHospitality.


The working group was also supported by Trowers & Hamlins LLP who provided expert legal advice during the code’s development.


To date, a number of other organisations have also endorsed the code including; Agricultural Law Association; Association of Convenience Stores; British Beer and Pubs Association, British Independent Retailers Association, Central Association of Agricultural Valuers, Country Land Association, Federation of Small Businesses, Property Owners Forum, Scottish Property Federation, Tenant Farmers Association and Tenant Farmers Association Cymru, UKActive and UK Major Ports Group.


Stakeholder commentary


Jane Gratton, Head of People Policy, British Chambers of Commerce said:




The pandemic has created severe cashflow problems for many SMEs, who will need time to rebuild and recover.  This code will help landlords and tenants to work together constructively to find solutions that keep businesses open and people in work.




Melanie Leech, Chief Executive, British Property Federation said:




The majority of property owners and occupiers are already working well together, creating shared solutions to mitigate the impact of coronavirus on their businesses. The code of practice published today builds on the many examples of good practice and reinforces the importance of constructive collaboration – not only over the next few months and once the government’s temporary legislative interventions come to an end later this year, but for the long term. 


The success of landlords and tenants working together as economic partners is vital to the UK’s recovery and to help ensure that viable businesses in distress as a result of coronavirus are supported, to protect both people’s jobs and the local authorities, savers and pensioners who own the majority of our town centres.




Helen Dickinson, Chief Executive, British Retail Consortium said:




The ongoing pandemic presents an enormous threat to the survival of thousands of retailers, and the millions of jobs they support. The necessary closure of most shops during lockdown has created a gaping hole in many retailers’ finances. This has been exacerbated by continued rent demands on stores around the country, even where most have been closed for business. A solution is needed. 


This code is a first step toward improving the dialogue between retailers and their landlords. An extension to tenant protections against aggressive behaviour from some landlords is essential to underpin it, and we warmly welcome the government’s commitment to this. 


However, all parties should recognise that the code does not provide a solution for those retailers who are simply unable to pay what is being demanded, and we now look forward to continuing our constructive dialogue with government and other parts of the property sector to address these unpayable rents. Without further action, both retailers and landlords remain in a precarious situation that could lead to substantial numbers of redundancies as soon as tenant protections expire.




Peter Cosmetatos, Chief Executive, Commercial Real Estate Finance Council said:




Commercial real estate investment and finance markets are a complex, interconnected ecosystem; the pandemic-related stress affecting so many rent-paying businesses also threatens their landlords, and their investors and their lenders, with potential implications for economic recovery.  


This code cannot magically plug revenue holes, but it sends a strong signal that good faith engagement and financial transparency are essential if commercial tenants and landlords are to find their way through this crisis.




Vivienne King, Chief Executive, Revo said:




Revo is pleased to support the government code of practice, which offers guidance to property owners and occupiers in navigating temporary rent arrangements through the pandemic, whilst underwriting the sanctity of existing contractual terms. 


There are many cases of owners and occupiers collaboration in managing loss of income, which the code of practice reflects and we will continue to support government in identifying the potential measures to address this loss of income, which not only impacts owners and occupiers, but the wider economy including the savers and pensioners who depend upon it.




Paul Bagust, Global Property Standards Director, Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said:




We are pleased to have helped government in shaping this code which will increase constructive engagement and transparency between landlords and tenants at this challenging time. We believe it will provide a basis for negotiated measures which recognise the mutual importance and interdependence of landlords and tenants in contributing to the economy.




Kate Nicholls, CEO, UKHospitality said:




The near-total wipeout of income from the hospitality sector has left it unable to meet its rent obligations. This code goes some way to bringing together landlord and tenant in the pursuit of a negotiated solution to allow hospitality businesses to move on and revert to the new normal, but this must be recognised as a first step that needs to be built on by all parties.


We remain of the view that further time and support is needed to facilitate a recovery for the hospitality sector, that is at the heart of our social lives and communities. The extension of the moratorium on aggressive enforcement and forfeiture is a welcome measure to allow this process to take place.

Speaking today at Race Online 2012’s 
National Digital Conference
, Mr Hunt revealed the Government’s ambitions for providing everyone in the UK with access to broadband speeds of at least 2MBps and superfast broadband should be available to 90% of people in each local authority area.


Support funding


“If we press ahead with expansion of superfast capabilities, then we can put UK in the global fast-lane,” said Mr Hunt. “If we fail to do so then we apply a handbrake to growth precisely when we need to power ahead.”


The market is expected to provide superfast broadband to around two thirds of the country and Government is supporting the roll-out to the third of UK homes and businesses that would otherwise miss out. To do this, Government has allocated £530m and County councils, unitary authorities and Local Enterprise Partnerships can apply for a share by developing a local broadband plan, setting out how superfast broadband access will be rolled-out in their area.


“We have set aside the money and the expertise to make this happen,” said Mr Hunt. “Now local authorities need to step up to the plate by bringing forward their own plans setting out how they will deliver this level of ambition.”

. There will be a particular focus on small and medium-sized enterprises (
SMEs
) and strategic employment zones to support economic growth. Edinburgh, Belfast, Cardiff and London will all receive support from this fund, and a UK-wide competition will decide up to six further cities that will also receive funding.


Telegraph poles consultation


A 
consultation into allowing new telegraph poles to be put up to carry cables to help superfast broadband roll-out
 opened today. Those wishing to take part have until 21 February 2012 to submit their comments. To support the Government’s wider ambition for the UK to have the best broadband network in Europe by 2015, DCMS has also published an 
advice note for Local Authorities and Communications Providers on Microtrenching and Street Works

Acceptance in Lieu scheme
 will total £30 million. This is a 50 per cent increase on the £20 million previously expected to be the total for the two schemes. The Cultural Gifts Scheme will boost lifetime giving and should incentivise philanthropy, benefit our public collections and complement the very successful Acceptance in Lieu scheme.

Mr Hunt said: “Superfast broadband is essential for economic growth and, increasingly, for our day-to-day lives.


“Many rural areas suffer poor internet access and the Government will not allow parts of the UK to miss out on the digital age.


“I am delighted that Suffolk and Rutland share our view of the importance of providing people with superfast broadband access.


“I hope other authorities will follow their example and work to bring broadband to their areas as soon as possible.”


Minister for Natural Environment and Fisheries, Richard Benyon said: “Broadband is essential for the economic and social growth of rural areas, bringing job opportunities, as well as support for vulnerable people.   This roll-out will help people in Suffolk and Rutland to work from home, run businesses and to study.”


The Government is investing £530 million to ensure the UK has the best superfast broadband network in Europe by 2015, with 90 per cent of homes and businesses having access to superfast broadband and for everyone in the UK having access to at least 2Mbps.


Suffolk has been allocated £11.68m and Rutland has been allocated £710,000 of Government funding.  The counties will now put the work out to tender.


Rutland will test whether the level of market interest in smaller-scale projects makes them commercially viable and sustainable.


The funding allocated to the counties is based on need - the Government has looked at the areas where the market will fail to deliver superfast broadband to enough premises on its own, and the cost of that.  It is not based on the number of people living or working in a county.


Notes to Editors






Further details on the Government’s broadband strategy
.






The market will provide superfast broadband to around two thirds of the country. The Government believes it is essential the whole country share in the benefits of high-speed internet access and is investing £530 million over this Parliament (confirmed in the spending review in October) to bring superfast broadband to the third of UK homes and businesses that would otherwise miss out. A further £300 million will be available by 2017 as part of the TV licence fee settlement. 






The Government has 
announced how much money has been allocated to the devolved nations and each local authority
.






Funds have been allocated to all English regions except to Greater London (where the market is expected to deliver) or to South Yorkshire and Cornwall (where the Regional Development Agency is already investing public money).






Ofcom
 defines ‘superfast broadband’ as broadband with speeds greater than 24 Mbps.

“We live in an increasingly diverse society and everyone, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation, should have the opportunity to fulfil their potential. This Government is committed to eliminating the prejudice and discrimination that prevents LGB&T people from being able to play their full part in our society.”


Key achievements


This Government has a lot to be proud off - we are committed to advancing LGB&T equality and we have made a real difference:




we recently announced that same-sex couples will be allowed to get married - the 
Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill
 is currently making its way through Parliament


in December 2011, we changed the law to allow same-sex couples to register their civil partnership on religious premises on a permissive basis


we now recognise 75 overseas same-sex partnerships as equivalent to UK civil partnerships, 50 more than when the Civil Partnership Act 2004 was enacted


we have delivered on our commitment to bring forward legislation to disregard consensual gay sex convictions, and those affected may now submit applications

The 
IPA/Metro Creative Pioneers Challenge
, backed by Government and supported by high profile patrons including Dragons’ Den’s James Caan, began in January 2012 with the aim of finding the next generation of creative pioneers.


More than half of the successful candidates have been given business support tailored to their needs, such as mentoring, office space or publicity.


Other pioneers have been offered paid internships in the industry or places on formal apprenticeship schemes.


Life-changing oppportunities


“To stimulate growth in the economy it is essential to help match employers with Britain’s incredible pool of talent, so this brilliant approach is exactly the sort of thing that we need to see,” Creative Industries Minister 
Ed Vaizey
 said. “Life-changing opportunities are on offer, and it’s a win-win situation for both successful candidates and those businesses offering to kick start great careers.”


IPA President Nicola Mendelsohn said: “Who would have thought one year ago that this vision would become a reality? We have broken new ground, learnt along the way, and identified new paths to market for fresh talent.


“Our ambition is for all IPA member agencies to adopt an apprentice, an intern and a start-up. The momentum is growing. The need is there. Our Creative Pioneers of 2012 are the proof.”

explains how the DCMS/Wolfson fund will help tell the secrets of the royal bedchamber
.






In February 2011, it was announced as part of the Spending Review that DCMS and the Wolfson Foundation would each provide a further £4 million to enable the DCMS/Wolfson Fund to hold two bidding rounds in the 2011-15 spending period, each one awarding £4 million. 






In this, the first of these two rounds, funds awarded will be available to be drawn down by successful applicants in the financial year 2012-13.  The second bidding round will be held in 2013-14, with the drawdown of funds in the financial year 2014-15. 






A total of 101 museums/museums services are eligible to apply for funding.  The maximum amount each can apply for is 75% of the total cost of their project, up to a limit of £300,000.






The Fund aims to provide capital funding for museums and galleries across England to deliver projects in one or a number of the following key areas:








Renovation and improvement of the display of exhibits in permanent galleries and exhibition spaces


Improvements to public spaces and access to the collection


Physical improvements to access for disabled visitors


Physical improvements to collection interpretation 




Improvements to environmental controls in public access spaces and galleries, in the context of improvements to visitor experience






There are four categories of institution which are eligible to apply for grants from the DCMS/Wolfson Fund. These are: museums and galleries directly sponsored by DCMS; designated university-based collections; museums/museums services with designated collections and museums/museums services with non-designated collections in Regional Hubs.






The DCMS/Wolfson Fund has distributed £47 million to 445 capital projects in eligible museums and galleries across England since 1990. The funding has been provided in equal shares by DCMS and the Wolfson Foundation.






The 
Wolfson Foundation
 is a charitable foundation set up in 1955. Grants are made for the advancement of science and medicine, health, education, the arts and humanities. As a general policy, funding is provided to back excellence, to act as a catalyst and to provide for promising future projects which may currently be underfunded. Last year the Foundation distributed some £40 million.

Mr Hunt believes that the reasonable estimated yield should be in the range of £73.7 million to £80.8 million in line with the Government-Appointed Members of the Horserace Betting Levy Board’s options. To achieve this, a number of changes will be made from the terms of the 49th Scheme - the headline rate of levy will increase from 10 to 10.75 per cent, and the threshold level under which betting shops pay a reduced rate of levy will come down from £88,740 to £50,000.


Despite a suggestion by the Government-appointed Members, there will be no change to the scheme in relation to foreign racing. As the Levy supports British horseracing it has been decided to collect it only in relation to bets on those races that take place in England, Scotland and Wales.


Mr Hunt’s decision takes account of submissions from both the racing and bookmaking industries together with advice from the Government-Appointed Members of the Horserace Betting Levy Board.


Jeremy Hunt said: “It is really disappointing that two important industries have been unable to come to a sensible commercial agreement.  I have tried to be fair by listening to the advice of the Independent members of the Levy Board and I will continue to be guided by their advice in future years until what should be a straightforward commercial negotiation can be taken permanently out of the hands of Ministers. 


“I am grateful to the Government-Appointed Members of the Horserace Betting Levy Board and both interested parties for their submissions.  I have now asked the Horserace Betting Levy Board to finalise the operational details of the scheme as a matter of urgency”.


The annual scheme is a levy on the profits of bookmakers from betting on British horseracing, and goes towards funding horseracing - for instance through integrity services, veterinary science, prize money, training initiatives and breeding programmes.


The increase in headline rate to 10.75 per cent will apply to telephone and internet betting operators (including betting exchanges) as well as Licensed Betting Offices.


For bookmakers who derive their gross profit from spread betting businesses the levy will be set at 2.15 per cent of such gross profit where it arises from British horseracing. For bookmakers taking bets at the racecourse the flat rate annual fee will increase in line with RPI to £210, whereas for those bookmakers who solely stand at point-to-point, harness racing or trotting events the new fee will be £166.

Notes to Editors






Written Ministerial Statement on the 50th Horse Race Betting Levy
. 






Government-Appointed Members submission
.






The process was as follows:






* The Secretary of State wrote to the Government Appointed Members (GAMs) of the Levy Board on 10 November asking for their independent recommendation by the end of November as to what the terms of the 50th Levy Scheme should be, having taken into account all relevant submissions from the parties. 
* The Bookmakers' Committee and the Levy Board members representing British Horseracing were then given until the beginning of January to provide the Secretary of State with their own submissions. These submissions, as well as the recommendation of the GAMs, have been published on the DCMS website. 
* The Secretary of State considered the parties' submissions alongside that of the GAMs before making his determination.  







The Secretary of State is writing to the GAMs, British Horseracing Authority and the Bookmakers Committee to thank them for their submissions and to explain his decision in more detail.






John Penrose, Minister for Tourism and Heritage with responsibility for horse racing has had no role in the decision making process to determine the 50th Levy scheme in order to avoid a conflict of interest.






The Government’s separate plans for longer-term reform of the Levy will be announced soon.

Under plans for the finals of the 2012 
School Games
, youngsters will aim for victory at four major 
London 2012
 venues just two months before the Olympics begin.


Culture Secretary 
Jeremy Hunt
 today revealed details of the School Games finals as he visited the Aquatics Centre - one of the sites that will host the event - alongside Olympic swimmer 
Mark Foster
, backstroke world-record-holder 
Liam Tancock
 and London 2012 hopeful 
Hannah Miley
. Young athletes will also go for gold at the Olympic Stadium, Velodrome and ExCel Centre.


“The 2012 School Games finals will be the largest ever event of its kind in the UK,” Mr Hunt said. “It will be an unprecedented opportunity for our young athletes to run on the Olympic track before Usain Bolt, cut through the pool before Michael Phelps, and feel the speed of the Velodrome before Victoria Pendleton.”


The Minister also revealed that Prince Harry is a supporter of the competition, adding: “As a keen sportsman himself, he will be following the progress of the School Games competitors over the coming months.”


The finals of the School Games will take place from 6 to 9 May next year and, like the Olympics and Paralympics, will feature an opening and closing ceremony.


About 1,600 young athletes are expected to compete in the finals, with round-the-clock support and advice from 700 coaches, support staff and volunteers. They will be also be cheered on by up to 35,000 spectators, with tickets being made available free of charge for family members and schools groups.


Nearly 8,000 schools have already registered for the School Games and 
registration for the 2012 competition
 will remain open until the end of the year.


The School Games is a new event which will continue after 2012, with the aim of holding the finals in the Olympic Park at regular intervals.

Highlights from the Collection will be shown in a series of five successive displays, marking the first time the collection has been shown in a public gallery in its 113 year history. It is part of the Whitechapel Gallery’s ongoing programme of opening up collections that are rarely seen by the public in the UK and will be free to attend.


The diverse nature of the Collection and its role promoting British culture on the world stage is the subject of a total of five displays at the Whitechapel Gallery.


The first display, from 3 June - 4 September 2011 is chosen by high profile figures that have a close connection with the works.


The seven selectors are: 
* Lord Boateng, former Government Minister and British High Commissioner to South Africa
* the Prime Minister’s wife Samantha Cameron 
* Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg
* Lord Mandelson, former Business Secretary
* Dame Anne Pringle, British Ambassador to Moscow
* Sir John Sawers, Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service
* Culture Minister Ed Vaizey


Key works include Lancashire Fair: Good Friday, Daisy Nook, a masterpiece by the famous Northern English artist L.S. Lowry, selected by Samantha Cameron; Peas are the New Beans by Bob and Roberta Smith, a humorous comment on accountancy selected by Lord Boateng; and Queen Elizabeth I, an enticing historical portrait by an unknown artist, selected by Lord Mandelson.


Staff who carry out a wide range of roles at Downing Street will be involved in the selection of works for a further display. Their close proximity to the art on show at the heart of Government will provide a unique perspective.  


The Collection has more than 13,500 works dating from the 16th century to the present day, shown in over 400 embassies and government buildings worldwide. 


Culture Minister Ed Vaizey said


“The Government Art Collection is a unique cultural resource that has, on a relatively modest budget, built up a collection that holds its own on the world art stage. 


“Thousands of works are already on display around the world and are regularly seen by the numerous visitors to Government buildings, but this is the first time that some of the many highlights have been brought together in one place for the benefit of the wider public. 


“I have no doubt that this will be a must-see exhibition, and the carefully choreographed series of displays at the Whitechapel Gallery is sure to draw art lovers from around the world.”


The Government Art Collection and the Whitechapel Gallery will present 4 further displays on the following themes:




a leading contemporary artist presents their personal take on the Collection (16 September - 4 December 2011)


a cultural and political commentator makes a selection highlighting the role of the Collection in cultural diplomacy (16 December 2011 - 26 February 2012)


staff from10 Downing Street choose their favourite works (9 March - 5 June 2012)


the Government Art Collection commissions a new work of art for the Whitechapel Gallery exhibition to be displayed alongside previous commissions during the Cultural Olympiad (21 June - 2 September 2012)




High profile selectors for each of these displays will be announced in the coming months. 


The displays will be shown in the dedicated Collections Gallery.


Notes to Editors






The Government Art Collection showcases British art in Government buildings including Downing Street, the Home Office and British Embassies and Residences in nearly every capital city across the world.  The Collection promotes British art and culture to the world and facilitates diplomatic and cultural links by selecting works of art with connections between the host country and the UK.






The Government Art Collection exhibition is a collaboration between the Government Art Collection and the Whitechapel Gallery. The presentation of the Government Art Collection is part of the Whitechapel Gallery’s ongoing programme of opening up collections that are rarely seen by the public in the UK.   It follows the presentation of five displays from the British Council Collection from April 2009 - May 2010, and four displays from The D. Daskalopoulos Collection, Greece, from June 2010 - May 2011. 






Following the end of its run at the Whitechapel Gallery the exhibition will tour Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery and Ulster Museum in late 2012 and 2013.






The Whitechapel Gallery’s programme of collection displays is supported by specialist insurer Hiscox.

providing resources for the frontline services that the public value cutting back on administration and waste


contributing to economic growth by securing investment of £530 million to boost the UK’s broadband infrastructure


retaining free entry for everyone to our national museums and galleries




We have also changed the distribution of Lottery good cause money, boosting income by 
£150 million for arts, sport and heritage
 after 2012.


Significant savings to other areas of spend have also been announced today, including overall budget reductions to Sport England (33%), UK Sport (28%), English Heritage (32%), Visit Britain (34%) and Arts Council England (29%).


We are also 
reforming or abolishing 19 of our 55 public bodies

The meeting discussed issues around managing traffic on the web and protecting the open Internet as well as the potential of creating an industry-wide agreement or set of principles, which could be used to guide self-regulation.


Web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee agreed to help the Broadband Stakeholder Group build upon their recently published transparency document to include the rights of consumers and business to connect to whomever they wanted on the Internet without discrimination.


Sir Tim said:


“While transparency about traffic management policy is a good thing, best practices should also include the neutrality of the net. The web has grown so fast precisely because we have had two independent markets, one for connectivity, and the other for content and applications.”


Mr Vaizey said:


“This was a useful and productive meeting.  It gave all interested parties the opportunity to air their views and discuss these issues.


“Internet traffic is growing.  Handling that heavier traffic will become an increasingly significant issue so it was important to discuss how to ensure the Internet remains an open, innovative and competitive place.


“It is good to see that industry has taken the lead on agreeing greater transparency for their traffic management policies.  I am pleased that someone with the expertise of Sir Tim has agreed to work with industry on expanding that agreement to cover managing and maintaining the open Internet.


“That agreement should be guided by three simple principles. The first is users should be able to access all legal content. Second, there should be no discrimination against content providers on the basis of commercial rivalry and finally traffic management policies should be clear and transparent.


“The Internet has brought huge economic and social benefits across the world because of its openness and that must continue.”

Public Lending Right
, or PLR, will go down in February 2011 from 6.29 to 6.25 pence per book borrowed. This decrease of less than 1 per cent follows a recommendation from the PLR Registrar, who manages the PLR Scheme, and 
consultation
 with representatives of authors and libraries.


In the current economic climate funds are not available to maintain or increase the current rate per loan paid to authors for loans of their books from public libraries. However, the Government remains committed to the importance and value of the PLR Scheme


Each year the amount due to registered authors is calculated by the Registrar. This is based on a rate per loan, obtained by dividing the money available in the fund by the total number of loans during the period. The decline in the book rate this year is because of an increase in the number of book loans while the funding has decreased. It will apply to book loans during the period July 2009 and June 2010.

 (MoU) in Delhi will give a boost to cultural exchanges between the UK and India and will lead to an extensive programme of activity in both countries over the next five years.


Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics Media and Sport, Jeremy Hunt said:


“The UK and India share a cultural bond that has been richly celebrated in art, literature, film and music for generations.


“This agreement will lead to a fantastic array of cultural activity over the coming years and I’m delighted that already new exhibitions by Anish Kapoor have been secured, along with a new Hay Festival of Literature in Kerala, a new alternative rock festival in cities across India and a host of other exciting projects.”


The Indian Secretary of Culture Jawhar Sircar said:


“The heads of the major cultural institutions of the UK and those of India met across the table, for the first time on such a scale after Independence.  The sincerity on both sides was very apparent and we are positive that some of the dream projects will finally materialise.”


Among the commitments laid out in the MoU are:




To develop an active programme of cultural exchanges in each country;


To facilitate exchanges of exhibitions and reciprocal visits;


To collaborate on skills sharing, digitising missing parts in libraries and archives to bring together collections; and


To facilitate exchange of best practice within media, broadcasting and information services.




The British Council will coordinate the delivery of these commitments, working in close partnership with a broad range of artists and cultural bodies across the UK.


Those witnessing the signing also included a sporting and cultural delegation that have been accompanying Jeremy Hunt on his visit to India including, Dame Lynne Brindley (British Library), Vernon Ellis (British Council), Sir Mark Jones (Victoria & Albert Museum), Neil MacGregor (British Museum), Lord Sebastian Coe (LOCOG), Dame Kelly Homes and Sir Steve Redgrave.

 build upon their recently published transparency document to include the rights of consumers and business to connect to whomever they wanted on the Internet without discrimination.


Sir Tim said “While transparency about traffic management policy is a good thing, best practices should also include the neutrality of the net. The web has grown so fast precisely because we have had two independent markets, one for connectivity, and the other for content and applications.”


The benefits of openness


Mr Vaizey
 said




This was a useful and productive meeting.  It gave all interested parties the opportunity to air their views and discuss these issues.






Internet traffic is growing.  Handling that heavier traffic will become an increasingly significant issue so it was important to discuss how to ensure the internet remains an open, innovative and competitive place.






It is good to see that industry has taken the lead on agreeing greater transparency for their traffic management policies.  I am pleased that someone with the expertise of Sir Tim has agreed to work with industry on expanding that agreement to cover managing and maintaining the open Internet.






That agreement should be guided by three simple principles. The first is users should be able to access all legal content. Second, there should be no discrimination against content providers on the basis of commercial rivalry and finally traffic management policies should be clear and transparent.






The Internet has brought huge economic and social benefits across the world because of its openness and that must continue.

Education Minister Elizabeth Truss announced today that 6 projects, including 2 new charities the Prince’s Trust and 
CVQO
, will receive the funding to build on previous work and support the government’s commitment to drive up education standards.


The new money comes after evidence and feedback from some of the 300 schools where 8,000 pupils took part. They said the projects had a hugely positive impact on improving engagement and attainment among the most disengaged children.


A study by Swansea University of Commando Joe’s, a Manchester-based project which provides trained mentors and activities for schools in some of the most deprived areas in the UK, found 56% of pupils taking part improved their maths grade while 70% showed improvement in writing.


Research and school feedback on the 3 other projects: Challenger Troop in Kent, Knowsley Skills Academy in Merseyside and SkillForce in Newcastle were also positive.


Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said:




The lives of thousands of disengaged children have been turned around thanks to these projects which instil our wonderful armed forces’ values of hard work and discipline.


That is why we are increasing the funding going to these important projects - so that even more children can benefit from the military ethos.




The projects instil teamwork, discipline and leadership in pupils through mentoring, outward bound activities and other group exercises focused on improving attainment and behaviour.


Activities include:




one-to-one mentoring skills to help address potential behaviour issues and keep pupils committed to their education


military-style obstacle courses to engage and motivate hard-to-reach pupils and help them understand how to transfer the elements which helped them succeed into the classroom


a mix of indoor and outdoor team-building exercises with an educational focus to encourage discipline, leadership, teamwork and good behaviour


working with schools and other agencies to re-integrate pupils who are not in education, employment or training and prepare them for post-16 courses or jobs


helping primary school children in their transition to secondary school through building their self-confidence




Grants were awarded in August 2012 to 4 organisations to deliver programmes through re-engagement with education and early intervention. More than 300 primary schools, secondary schools and pupil referral units are now being served by these providers with more than 8,000 of the most challenging pupils already taking part.


Mark Poole, Head of Year at Walmer Science College, Kent - one of the schools to benefit - said:




The impact has been really quite dramatic. Some children have, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say, had their lives turned around.




Sean Kelly, Head of Academy, Top Valley Academy, Nottingham:




There has been a significant reduction in negative behaviours filed by teachers. There is a significant improvement in teacher assessment levels and grades in English, maths and science and effort grades recorded by subject show that those on the programme are trying harder.




A study by Swansea University into Commando Joe’s programmes in 4 schools serving 57 pupils found:




56% of pupils in the study improved their maths academic achievement grades


46% of pupils in the study improved their reading academic achievement grades


70% of pupils in the study improved their writing academic achievement grades




Research by the National Foundation for Educational Research (
NFER
) into Knowsley Skills Academy (
KSA
) found that 90% of the 30 
NEETs
 on the company’s programme gained employment.


The 
NFER
 report said:




Feedback from young people, parents and other agencies indicates that 
KSA
 is making considerable progress at turning around the lives of young people and giving them the motivation and skills to make a successful return to mainstream education.




Teacher assessment of the direct impact on 32 pupils involved in Challenger Troop programmes found:




77% showed improvement in self-control and behaviour after 6 months with 10% showing improvement after 1 day


86% showed improvement in the their social skills after 6 months


73% showed improvement in their self-awareness and confidence after 6 months




SkillForce worked with 3,291 young people on year-long courses in 2011 to 2012. Their survey found:




84% of year 11 pupils who completed the course went on to some form of employment, education or training


86% of pupils said the course had helped them to have a positive attitude


77% said they now treated their teachers with respect




The 6 projects are Commando Joe’s in Greater Manchester, Challenger Troop in Kent, SkillForce in Newcastle, Knowsley Skills Academy in Merseyside, The Prince’s Trust and 
CVQO
.


Mike Hamilton, Director of Commando Joe’s, said:




We’re so pleased to receive this extra funding as it means we can take Commando Joe’s to more schools.


We’ve been based mainly in the North West so far, but now we can expand our operations across the country.


The money will go towards recruiting more staff and delivering more programmes to enable more schools to access the provision which will ultimately help to inspire and motivate thousands more young people to reach their full potential inside and outside the classroom.




Martina Milburn, Chief Executive of The Prince’s Trust, said:




The Prince’s Trust is proud of the charity’s longstanding relationship with military personnel across the UK, including our partnership with Help for Heroes.


It is exciting to bring this experience to the Department of Education’s inspired military ethos initiative in the knowledge of the significant contribution our inspirational service personnel can make to the lives of disadvantaged young people.




Notes to editors


A total of £4.8 million has been awarded in 6 grants to use military ethos in schools to improve education attainment of the most disengaged pupils.

The 
Learning Legacy website
, launched by the 
Olympic Delivery Authority
 (ODA) last year, will continue after the ODA is wound up.


The Major Projects Authority, a partnership of the Cabinet Office, HM Treasury and other departments, will take over running the website with the aim of improving the success rate of major projects across central Government.


“The Learning Legacy initiative was created to ensure the lessons of delivering one of Europe’s largest construction projects were preserved for future generations,” said Simon Wright, ODA Director of Venues and Infrastructure.


“I am delighted it has found its natural home with the MPA, and I hope those charged with delivering significant infrastructure programmes, whether in the public or private sectors, will make use of the intelligence gleaned from working on such a unique challenge.”


Expansion


The Learning Legacy website is packed with case studies and reports put together by the ODA and its supply chain of companies from all over the UK, along with contributions from independent industry bodies and academics.


It is now set to expand with new material from the 
London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games
 (LOCOG) and some of their partners and suppliers, covering topics such as sustainable sourcing and waste management.

John Penrose said:


“Lottery players have a right to expect their cash to be used wisely and effectively on good causes. We pledged to cut Lottery running costs because it’s vital to public confidence that as much money as possible goes to the arts, sport, heritage, and charities, while still ensuring that funds are managed properly. This way, everyone who buys a ticket will know the good causes are getting the best possible value for money.”


The distributors concerned receive between them about £1,400 million every year to hand out in grants, but they currently spend about 6.5% on grant admin costs. John Penrose has written to distributors to point out that best practice in comparable charities appears to be about five per cent for these costs, and he wants distributors to match this.


Heritage Lottery Fund will have until March 2013 to reduce their costs, while the Big Lottery Fund, Arts Council England and the merged Sport England/ UK Sport will have an extra 12 months to allow for other reforms which involve changes to their income, reorganisation and merger respectively.


Distributors have also been asked to cap their total running costs, which includes research, technical support and public involvement in grant decisions to eight per cent, again in line with the best practice of charities carrying out similar activities.

DCMS and 
Arts Council England
 are to invest £80 million in a new series of ’match fund’ schemes, to raise at least an equivalent amount from private donors for the culture sector.  This is part of a package of measures set out today to help create long-term financial sustainability and to encourage increased giving to culture.   


The package will catalyse and facilitate individual and corporate giving by removing barriers, creating incentives and highlighting and sharing what works.  It also includes:




a ‘year of corporate giving’ strengthening recognition for donors;


harnessing digital technologies; and


building fundraising skills across the sector.




Philanthropic tradition


Jeremy Hunt 
said:


“This country has a great tradition of philanthropy in the arts, and I pay tribute to all those who have donated to our artists and cultural institutions, whether to the tune of ten pounds or ten million pounds.  They are role models, whose support and generosity shows just what can be achieved.


“Public funding of the arts will always continue - we have 
set out Government funding for the life of this Parliament
, and we have 
increased the amount of Lottery money going to the arts
.  But we must help our arts organisations develop more mixed funding models, to help give them long term financial stability and certainty.”

They are being set up by teachers, charities, universities, employers, and other groups in response to demand from local parents and industry.


They include:




55 new mainstream and 16-19 Free Schools


13 new University Technical Colleges (UTCs).




In addition, a further eight Free Schools and three UTCs are already working on setting up their schools to open in September 2012 and beyond.


Some alternative provision Free Schools, special Free Schools and Studio Schools are likely to be approved later this year.


Free Schools and UTCs will increase choice for parents and pupils in communities across the country and significantly, the vast majority are in disadvantaged areas. They are central to the Government’s drive to raise education standards for all, regardless of their background or family circumstances. The make up of the new Free Schools announced today reflects the Government’s commitment to improving social mobility, with education reform at the core. UTCs will play an important role in ensuring that young people have the skills that employers demand - which is crucial for economic growth.


Free Schools are funded by the Government and, like academies, have greater freedoms than local authority run schools. They are run by teachers and have freedom over the length of the school day, the curriculum and how they spend their money.


Of the Free Schools aiming to open from 2012 onwards, 21 are primary schools, 33 are secondary schools, eight are all-through schools and one is a 16-19 school. More than two thirds have proposed sites which are situated in the 50 per cent most deprived areas of the country. Others will meet additional need for schools places, meaning that more than 90 per cent of successful applicants have proposed school sites in areas that are deprived or crying out for places.


UTCs are academies for 14-19-year-olds. They focus on providing technical education that meets the needs of modern business. They offer full-time courses, which focus on technical specialisms and academic studies. These specialisms include engineering, science technologies and health care.  All UTCs are sponsored by a local university and employers. In total, more than 130 employers are involved in the 13 UTCs. Among them are household names like Silverstone race track, the Royal Navy, Procter & Gamble, Rolls-Royce, and BlackBerry.


Education Secretary Michael Gove said:




The people who are driving Free Schools and UTCs are true pioneers. They are leading a revolution in the education system.


These new schools allow talented and experienced people to be imaginative and bold in creating great new schools. They will offer more choice to parents in the type of education their child receives, and will raise standards in many communities where the need is great.


UTCs are also a key part of the Government’s drive to provide school leavers with the technical knowledge and skills that industry demands. This is vital for our economic growth.




The new Free Schools will join the 24 that opened in September 2011.


The new Free Schools approved include:




Brighton Bilingual Primary School, which plans to teach in English for 50 per cent of the time, and Spanish for the other 50 per cent of the time.


Kingfisher Hall Primary Academy, set up by Cuckoo Hall Academy - an outstanding primary academy in Enfield. This follows the successful opening of Woodpecker Hall Free School in September.


School 21 - an all-age Free School in Newham dedicated to helping pupils from the most deprived areas.


The King’s School Woolston, which will be a new secondary school in Warrington. It is being set up by local parents and teachers and is strengthened by the leadership of Sir Iain Hall as Chief Executive of the Trust. Sir Ian is an experienced head teacher, education adviser and co-founder of Future Leaders.


The London Academy of Excellence, which will be a brand new sixth form Free School. It is being set up by Brighton College - a highly successful independent school - with other independent schools. It is aimed at pupils from disadvantaged areas.




The 13 new UTCs announced today are spread across the country. Universities and employers will play a role in developing the curriculum in each UTC and will provide work placements for students. Working in partnership with universities and employers, UTCs will provide school leavers with the technical knowledge and skills that industry demands. The 13 announced today join the two UTCs already open and the three that are already in the process of being set up.


This wave of new schools will create more choice for parents, including those in the most deprived areas, and will raise standards in education - both technical and mainstream.


Sir Iain Hall, Chief Executive of the King’s School Woolston Trust and co-founder of Future Leaders, said:




I am delighted to be given the opportunity to work with a dedicated group of parents in maintaining high quality education in their community.


At our interview, the chair of the parent’s group, Colin Scotland, said that in being able to apply to open a Free School he felt ‘empowered’. We are not only empowered but highly excited at the prospect of opening King’s School Woolston.




Lord Baker, Chairman of the Baker Dearing Educational Trust and Edge Foundation, said:




These 18 UTCs will be teaching over 10,000 students before the next election - a great beginning.

Notes to editors






Free Schools are funded by the Government and operate like the successful academies programme. They have greater freedom than local authority schools, including more choice over the curriculum, how money is spent and the length of the school day.






A more streamlined and rigorous approval process was used for 2012 Free School applications. This enabled the Department to compare proposals against each other and choose those most likely to deliver the aims of the programme. The application process involved groups submitting detailed proposals, with successful groups then invited to an interview at the Department.






All applicant groups were required to provide details of the individuals involved in the project, and these individuals have undergone checks carried out by the Department’s Due Diligence Unit. More about the approval process can be found on the Free Schools pages of the website.






Of the 63 mainstream Free Schools approved to open from 2012 onwards:
* 12 characterise themselves as faith schools
  * 11 are being set up by existing schools or academies
  * 33 are being set up by local groups, including teachers, parents, charities and community groups
  * two are existing independent schools that will join the state sector
  * of the 55 Free Schools approved today, 52 are aiming to open in 2012, and three in 2013
  * of the eight Free Schools already in the pipeline, seven are aiming to open in 2012 and one in 2013.






More information on the groups - including names, phase and the local authority they plan to be located in - is available on the 
Free Schools pages of this website
.






The groups will now work to make their schools a reality. This includes undertaking a statutory consultation in their local area and taking steps to recruit their school’s Principal Designate.






Capital funding for these projects is still to be decided.






Charter schools in New York, which are similar to Free Schools, have been shown dramatically to close the gap separating inner-city neighbourhood students from those of the wealthiest suburbs - by 86 per cent in maths and 66 per cent in English.

At home, schools with greater independence are also excelling. From 2009 to 2010, results in academies increased by an average of 7.8 percentage points (proportion of pupils in academies achieving five or more GCSEs at A*-C, including English and maths) compared with the national average increase of 4.5 percentage points for all state schools.

The Department plans to establish at least 24 UTCs by 2014. The first UTC, the JCB Academy in Staffordshire, opened in 2010. The second, the Black Country UTC in Walsall, opened in September 2011. In addition to the 13 projects announced today, three UTCs have also been approved to open in Aston, Hackney (both 2012) and Greenwich (2013). We expect to launch another application process in due course, and more details will appear on our website.






The Budget in 2011 announced an extra £150 million for UTCs and technical academies. The funding that the Department has received for UTCs will provide for the individual projects announced today, as well as further UTCs and technical academies to be announced in due course.






More information can be found on the 
UTC pages of this website.






UTCs are a key part of the Government’s Plan for Growth, helping to build a strong and balanced economy by equipping young people with the skills and experience they need and that employers demand. To help do this the Government is also creating a massive expansion of work placement schemes and funding for 250,000 extra apprenticeships. More details on the Plan for Growth can be found on the 
HM Treasury website.

The founder and Chair of Peyton & Byrne originally burst on to the London restaurant scene in 1994 with the Atlantic Bar & Grill, later followed by outlets including Coast, Mash & Air and Isola.


In 2004, the Irish-born restaurateur launched the eco-friendly Inn The Park, a restaurant and cafe in St James’s Park.


Peyton & Byrne now leads the way in public space dining with outlets including the Restaurant at the Royal Academy of Arts and The Orangery and Pavilion, both at Kew Gardens. Mr Peyton is also involved in a number of TV projects, including judging the dishes on BBC’s Great British Menu.


Tourism Minister 
John Penrose
, who presented the OBE to Mr Peyton, said: “His restaurants have been at the forefront of both architectural design as well as gastronomic standards and he has played a huge role in the London and British restaurant scene for nearly twenty years.


“The quality, variety and scope of British food has been transformed in the last few decades, and Oliver has been a leading light in the process. This honour is richly deserved.”


Mr Peyton said: “I am thrilled to have received this award, it’s a magnificent honour. I am lucky enough to work in a business that I love alongside my family and to win this is the icing on the cake.”

",press_release,2011-02-14T00:00:00+00:00,"Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport","The London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games remain on time and within budget, data published today by the Government and Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) confirms.


Figures from the Government’s 
Annual Report on the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games
 show that the overall funding package for the Games remains at £9.298bn.


The Anticipated Final Cost (AFC) of the ODA programme is £7.301bn. This includes a like for like increase in the ODA’s spend of £12m, plus additional funding for park operations - which has been included in the AFC for the first time - of £57m, making the overall increase in the quarter £69m.


It was reported in February 2010 that the ODA will take on additional responsibilities for the operation of the Olympic Park and its venues and facilities between 2011 and 2014. As previously reported, the ODA estimated that the total additional cost of Park Operations would be up to £160m depending on the finalisation of scope, delivery approach, procurement and other factors. The ODA’s budget for this additional park operations work has now been finalised at £158m of which LOCOG will receive £67m for work such as venue operations, licensing and testing.


Following the decision around the Spending Review to make financial support available to operational delivery, LOCOG will also receive £36m from the funding package to contribute to the cost of using the Olympic Village and to meet costs arising from changes to venues that generated savings for the ODA. A further £27m is being retained by Government to cover further cost pressures that may arise in staging the Games.


Funding of up to £22.5m has been committed to some host local authorities to ensure the cost of Games-time operations, including additional waste and street cleaning, are not borne solely by local council-tax payers. Provision of up to £90.5m will also be made available to various Olympic organisers for other operational activities to be agreed. Use of this provision will be published in future quarterly economic reports.


Construction of the venues and infrastructure for the Games is 79 per cent complete with key achievements this year including: the completion of the first purpose-built venue, the Lee Valley White Water Centre at Broxbourne and the official turning on of the Stadium lights by the Prime Minister. The Velodrome is on course to be the first Olympic Park venue to be completed.


The ODA also announced today that the Multi Storey Car Park for the Main Media Complex is complete. The facility will make it as convenient as possible for media to broadcast the Games to four billion people worldwide.


Minister for Sport and the Olympics, Hugh Robertson said:


“The construction phase is progressing on time and to budget putting the London 2012 programme in the best possible shape. This is the year when tickets will go on sale, test events start, volunteers are recruited, the torch relay route is announced and venues start being prepared for competition. Now is the time for everybody to start planning their Games.”


Olympic Delivery Authority Chief Executive, Dennis Hone, said:


“We remain on schedule and within budget as we push ahead into the final year of construction. The project is now 79 per cent finished to Games-time with the Velodrome set to become the first venue on the Park completed later this month. We continue to bear down on costs where possible with around £780m now saved since the start of the project to keep us within budget. We announced over a year ago the additional costs for Park Operations which have now been absorbed into the latest Anticipated Final Cost (AFC) in line with expectations.


“The ODA is on track to deliver a fantastic stage for the Games and in legacy though we are not complacent - there is still a lot of hard work ahead.”


In total around £780m in savings have been achieved by the ODA since the November 2007 baseline budget was agreed, including £33m in the last quarter. The majority of these savings have been used to control the budget by offsetting cost increases in other areas of the programme and helping to reduce calls on the contingency.


The gross allocation of contingency on the programme at 31 December 2010 was £1.133 bn, leaving £839m of the contingency originally available for the ODA. Contingency funding totalling £304m was released during the last quarter for park operations work, the increase in VAT and anticipated additional costs at the Royal Artillery Barracks and Games time training venues. 


From April 2011, overall £0.5bn will be available as contingency for additional cross-programme issues that may arise, including any major changes in security circumstances. This reflects the programme’s changing focus from construction to operational requirements.


In December the ODA announced the shortlist of private-sector organisations who have been invited to tender for the Athletes’ Village. This begins the process that will see the public purse repaid for its investment.


Notes to Editors






A copy of the 
Annual Report on the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games 2011
 is available on the DCMS website.






This report covers the period January to December 2010 including the economic update figures from the October 2010 to December 2010 quarter.






The public sector funding package for the Games announced in March 2007 was £9.325 billion. Of this £6.1 billion was identified as the Olympic Delivery Authority budget, with around £2 billion contingency and £1.2 billion for non-ODA activities such as wider security and support for elite and community sport. On 24 May 2010 the Government announced that the ODA budget would be reduced by £27m in the current financial year taking the public sector funding package to £9.298bn.






As reported in the February 2010 Annual Report, it was agreed that the ODA would take on additional responsibilities for the operation of the Olympic Park and its venues and facilities between 2011 and the handover to legacy owners by 2014. Last year the ODA estimated that the total additional cost of park operations would be up to £160m depending on the finalisation of scope, delivery approach, procurement and other factors.  A business case has now been agreed and the additional budget for this work has been finalised at £158m. LOCOG will be responsible for delivering some of the operational arrangements including venue operations, licensing and testing. Funding for this additional scope of £67m has been transferred directly to them.






The 2010 Spending Review made provision for all known Olympic programme cost requirements and pressures at the time. As we set out in the November 2010 Quarterly Report, contingency will continue to be strictly controlled and will only be released to meet costs that are essential for the delivery of the Games, where they cannot reasonably be met from existing budgets.






The Athletes’ Village will deliver the legacy of 2,818 new homes for east London after the Games. 1,379 of the new homes have been purchased by Triathlon Homes to become legacy affordable housing. The ODA owns the remaining 1,439 homes which will become private housing after the Games, together with six future development plots in the Village site with the potential for a further 2,000-2,500 new homes.






The ODA have invited nine shortlisted private sector organisations or consortia to submit proposals for the purchase and long-term management on the Olympic Village. The ODA is looking to secure best-value together with a long-term commitment from an investor with the experience and expertise needed to realise the full potential of the new homes being built and the future development opportunities across the Village site.






The Home Office announced in December 2010 the forecast cost of the wider policing and security programme is £475m from a budget of £600m and that the Government is to contribute £282m towards the cost of venue security. This is additional to the £475m anticipated cost for wider policing and security, but within the £9,298m total package.

The Minister’s ruling follows a recommendation by the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest (Reviewing Committee), administered by Arts Council England. The Reviewing Committee recommended that the export decision be deferred on the grounds that the table top is of outstanding aesthetic importance and outstanding significance for the study of early European marquetry.


The table top, which dates from the mid-sixteenth century, was intended to celebrate the military acumen and political courage of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, who abdicated voluntarily in 1556. It is likely to have been commissioned by a very senior member of the imperial court and made by one of the most accomplished workshops in Augsburg - a German city that was home to some of the most important developments in sixteenth century marquetry.


The table top is an exceptionally rare and complex example of south German marquetry, shows very fine workmanship and remains in unusually good condition. The design is intended to be seen from all sides, perhaps suggesting the multi-facetted challenges of imperial rule. Unlike a lot of early furniture, it retains much of the pristine impact that it would have had when originally produced as an exceptional luxury object.


Ownership of the table top can be traced as far back as the early to mid-nineteenth century. Gregory de Ligne Gregory, an energetic and eclectic collector, acquired the table top for Harlaxton Manor in Lincolnshire as part of a nineteenth century interest in collecting German Renaissance furniture.


Simon Swynfen Jervis, Reviewing Committee member, said:


“This spectacular and historic marquetry table top is a masterpiece of international significance, both for the virtuoso quality of its execution and the rich complexity of its design. There is nothing comparable in the UK.”


The decision on the export licence application for the table top will be deferred for a period ending on 12 February 2013 inclusive. This period may be extended until 12 May 2013 inclusive if a serious intention to raise funds is expressed with a view to making an offer to purchase the table top at the recommended price of £274,300 (inclusive of VAT; but please note that any institution which is able to reclaim VAT would need to match £265,250 plus VAT at 20%, the latter of which could be reclaimed).

The Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest is an independent body, serviced by Arts Council England, which advises the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport on whether a cultural object, intended for export, is of national importance under specified criteria. Where the Committee finds that an object meets one or more of the criteria, it will normally recommend that the decision on the export licence application should be deferred for a specified period. An offer may then be made from within the United Kingdom at or above the fair market price.

Lord Coe will also sit on the DCMS board.


They will join David Verey who was recently appointed as the lead non-executive director to the DCMS board.


Jeremy Hunt said:


“These appointments create an incredibly strong team on our board whose combined experience across a wide range of sectors will be of huge benefit to my department. Tracy Long has been a member of the DCMS board for some time and will continue to combine a detailed understanding of how the department operates with her wealth of knowledge from the business and media world.


“Peter Bazalgette, alongside his business acumen, will bring to the board particular insight into a broad spectrum of media issues. And Lord Coe’s sporting background and his current role as the Chair of the LOCOG board, helping to deliver the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games, will provide a strong sport and Olympic focus.”


The appointments follow a cross-Whitehall drive to improve governance and overhaul departmental boards, bringing in more business expertise. In June of last year Lord Browne was appointed as the first lead non-executive director to the Cabinet Office board and has been working with Secretaries of State on appointing non-executive directors to their boards.


Lord Coe has been invited to attend DCMS Board meetings by virtue of his position as Chair of LOCOG. He will cease to attend the departmental board at the point at which he leaves his post at LOCOG.


Notes to Editors






There will be 6 DCMS board meetings a year.






Non-executive directors are entitled to claim £15,000 pa. Lord Coe as board member will not be paid.






The appointment process for non-executive directors has been run according to OCPA guidelines. All appointments are made on merit and political activity plays no part in the selection process. However, in accordance with the original Nolan recommendations, there is a requirement for appointees’ political activity (if any declared) to be made public. Tracy Long and Peter Bazalgette have both declared no political affiliations/donations.






More information about the updated protocol for departmental boards, which sets out in outline how boards, which are chaired by Secretaries of State are expected to operate, can be found on the Cabinet Office website.

 has announced his intention to carry out a review of stake and prize limits for gaming machines covered by the

.


Speaking at the 
British Amusement Catering Trades Association
 (BACTA) AGM, Mr Penrose said: “It’s been a long time since we had a review of stakes and prizes and so I want to kick start the process.


“I’ll be writing shortly to all members of the industry asking for their feedback on what the review should look like and the best process to follow.”


Prior to the implementation of the Gambling Act 2005, a system of regular, routine reviews of stakes and prizes was established by custom on a triennial basis. The intention to reintroduce these periodic reviews follows the recent 
decision to increase the stakes on B3 gaming machines
, and it’s hoped a more systematic approach will give arcade and manufacturing business more certainty when it comes to planning and responding to economic challenges.


The government will now work with stakeholders and industry to work out the details in the coming weeks.

The 
DCMS Jerwood Creative Bursaries Scheme
 was launched in 2010 to kick start the careers of talented new graduates who could not afford to take unpaid internships - a common entry point to jobs in the arts.


At a reception celebrating the scheme’s success as the pilot phase draws to a close, it was revealed 38 out of the 42 recipients have already found new positions, with many being offered permanent roles with the organisations that had hosted them for the bursary scheme.


“Many of the participants had experienced real challenges since graduating and were facing having to give up their dream of a career in the arts out of financial necessity,” scheme director 
Kate Danielson
 said.


“This Scheme came along at just the right time to support their entry into the industry. Talented young people are the life blood of our sector and unless we ensure that our leaders of the future come from as wide a range of backgrounds as possible and are supported from an early stage, we will be weakening the sector at its roots.”


Bursary recipient 
Shakera Ahad
 (pictured), who now has a job as an Assistant Producer at Unlimited Theatre in Leeds, said: “The Creative Bursaries Scheme raises aspiration levels of talented and able graduates who, in this competitive industry, are otherwise unlikely to receive such investment in their personal and professional development.”


New work placements were created with a cross-section of the best cultural institutions across England, from Tate St Ives in Cornwall to the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and from The Sage Gateshead to Brighton Dome and Festival. Each placement was a new role designed by the host organisation, a quarter of which have now become embedded as permanent roles.

government to redirect vast 
HS2
 savings into unprecedented transport investment across the country, benefiting more people, in more places, quicker


the North will receive £19.8 billion for new inter-city and local links


a further £12 billion on top of this set aside to deliver Liverpool to Manchester Northern Powerhouse Rail route


new £1 billion fund for the North of England will also help fund new roads in the North West, cutting congestion and boosting capacity – with more money for more buses and more frequent routes






The North West will benefit from more frequent trains, more capacity and faster journeys in a major funding boost to create stronger public transport networks.  


Today (4 October 2023), we have announced the 
Network North
 plan, which will build better connectivity across the North and Midlands with faster journey times, increased capacity and more frequent, reliable services. 


Our plan will see 
HS2
 delivered between Birmingham and Euston in central London as planned. But every penny that would have been spent building new track between the West Midlands and Manchester will instead be redirected into roads, rail and buses to drive economic growth and provide jobs.  


Rather than just connecting Birmingham and Manchester, we will set aside £12 billion for links between Liverpool and Manchester to ensure the delivery of Northern Powerhouse Rail (
NPR
) and then invest £36 billion in hundreds of projects in towns, cities and rural areas across our whole country, and in roads, rail and buses – investment on a truly unprecedented scale that will drive economic growth and provide jobs.


Over £3 billion will also help deliver faster and more frequent trains between all the North’s main cities including Hull, Leeds, Sheffield and Manchester. We will bring Hull into Northern Powerhouse Rail, upgrade and electrify the line between Sheffield and Leeds, and upgrade the route between Sheffield and Manchester. We will also create a network where all the 9 biggest cities of the North are connected to each other by fast, electric trains several times an hour.  


Bradford will be given a new through station and new line linking to the 
NPR
 route near Huddersfield, with a Bradford-Manchester journey time of around 30 minutes once the new high-speed line west of Marsden is open. There will also be much faster journeys from Bradford to Huddersfield.


Further benefits for the North West will include:  




nearly £4 billion through City Region Sustainable Transport Settlements (
CRSTS
) to ensure all 6 Northern city regions will receive more than double their 
CRSTS1
 funding to improve connectivity in their areas, which could pay for schemes such as the extension of the Manchester Metrolink to Heywood, Bolton, Wigan and Manchester Airport (T2) and bus rapid transit corridors in Manchester


a brand new £2.5 billion fund to transform local transport in 14 rural counties, smaller cities and towns. This new money could pay for new stations, further electrification, bus corridors and new integrated public transport networks. The Energy Coast Line between Carlisle, Workington and Barrow will be upgraded, improving capacity and journey times, enabling trains every 30 minutes between Carlisle, Workington and Whitehaven. The upgrade will also accommodate major new freight demands from the new coal mine and provide regular services for the Westlakes Science Park, Nuclear Academy and Sellafield. This could support the creation of over 18,000 jobs


£100 million will be shared across the North and Midlands to support the development and rollout of London-style contactless and smart ticketing, supporting seamless travel by enabling contactless or smartcard payment


£3.3 billion long-term road resurfacing fund for North alone will combat the potholes causing misery for drivers and more than £500 million in funding will be provided for 2 major road schemes around Manchester. These include a new link road between the M62 and the M60, Manchester’s ring road and the busiest freight route outside the M25. The scheme will help tackle congestion and reduce delays  


a total of £300 million will ensure the delivery of 9 smaller road schemes, including the A582 South Ribble Distributor, Kendal Northern Access Route and the Wigan East-West Route


the popular 
£2 bus fare
 will also be extended until the end of December 2024 instead of rising to £2.50 as planned. This will mean passengers on a bus journey from Lancaster to Kendal will save £12.50 every time they travel


a £700 million bus funding package in the North will also see more buses and more frequent routes. They will include a new service to Royal Blackburn Hospital, doubling the service between Northwich and Chester and more buses to industrial estates and business parks


Greater Manchester will also receive around £1.5 billion from the 
CRSTS2
 budget and around £900 million additional funding – funded from 
HS2
 – which is an unprecedented investment in local transport networks. That is more than double their allocation under the previous programme


Liverpool City Region will also receive c.£1 billion from the 
CRSTS2
 budget, plus a further £600 million on top – funded from 
HS2
. That is more than double their allocation under the last round

I’m in no doubt that the expert panel chaired by Sue Davies will do a fantastic job in whittling down the list to ensure we have the very best chance of succeeding in front of UNESCO in the future.”


Once the Tentative List has been completed it will be submitted to UNESCO. Nominations from this list will then be put forward from 2012 for inclusion on the World Heritage List. It’s hoped a new UK Tentative List will be completed by Spring next year.


Notes to Editors




The 
list of 38 places that have put themselves forward for consideration for the tentative list
 can be found on the DCMS website. 


The Government has conducted a review of its UK World Heritage Policy. The aim was to help determine whether the UK should continue to nominate sites for World Heritage status and what more we should do for existing sites. The review considered the UK’s approach to World Heritage, the costs and benefits of World Heritage status, informed by research undertaken by Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PWC), on the management, protection and funding of sites, and the policy for future nominations.


The Government proposes to submit a new Tentative List to UNESCO in 2011, with a view to re-commencing nominating from 2012. Following this, it proposes to continue to make nominations to the World Heritage List, though not necessarily every year.


The full list of the nine panel members are:




Sue Davies - who will Chair the panel- and is Chief Executive of Wessex Archaeology Ltd and Chair of the United Kingdom National Commission for UNESCO’s Culture Committee.


Dr Peter Fowler - an academic writer and researcher in archaeological, agrarian history and heritage fields. He is an international consultant and is currently adviser to three international bids for World Heritage Status.


Dr Birgitta Ringbeck- is a member of the German Commission for UNESCO and Head of Section for the Protection and Care of Historical Monuments at the Ministry for Building and Transport in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany.


Susan Williamson- until 2009 was Head of International Policy at Historic Scotland, and currently represents the UK on the Council of Europe’s steering committee for heritage and landscape.


Dr Mike Pienkowski- is Honorary Executive Director of the UK Overseas Territories Conservation Forum, a member of the UK Executive Committee of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, and a member of the UK Man Biosphere Committee.


Christopher Pound - is an architect and town planner experienced in caring for historic places and has advised on the successful nomination of previous places to the World Heritage List.


Prof Mike Robinson - is Director of the Centre for Tourism and Cultural Change at Leeds Metropolitan University and is a member of the Culture Committee of the UK Commission for UNESCO.


Dr David Thackray - is currently the Head of Archaeology for the National Trust and has responsibility for the working group which manages the seven World Heritage Sites under the National Trust’s care


Paul Drury - is the founder of the Paul Drury Partnership consultancy on historic environment policy and practice. He is an archaeologist, architectural historian and a building surveyor, and former chair of the Council of Europe’s steering committee for cultural heritage.

Share Your GREAT Britain is the latest phase of the 
GREAT Britain - You’re Invited marketing programme
, which has featured invitations from celebrities such as chef Jamie Oliver and actress Dame Judi Dench.


VisitBritain has created a 
free online toolkit
 allowing people to personalise their own greeting inviting their global network to holiday in the UK this year. It includes a Facebook app with 10 reasons to visit the UK and a digital postcard. Businesses will also be able to take advantage of a selection of posters and advertising templates.


“This is an innovative and personal way of encouraging more visitors to the UK and comes at a time when we want to ensure Britain is top of everyone’s holiday wish list,” Tourism Minister 
John Penrose
 said. “From the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games to the Diamond Jubilee, we want as many people as possible to come and join in the celebrations.”


The year to be in Britain


One in four visits to the UK last year came from people Visiting Friends and Relatives (VFR) and these visits contribute £3.6 billion to the economy each year.


Sandie Dawe
, chief executive of 
VisitBritain
, said: “Our goal is to deliver four million visitors over four years who will spend an additional £2 billion. In June 2011 we launched a 
series of films
 in which British celebrities extended a personal invitation to Britain. This was followed by deals and offers from the travel industry.


“Now, we believe this invitation from the British public will inspire a greater number of visitors to choose Britain for their next holiday. 2012 is the year to be in Britain - with a raft of new festivals, exhibitions and events marking the Diamond Jubilee, celebrations of Shakespeare and Dickens and the hosting of the Olympic Games.”

The Minister’s ruling follows a recommendation by the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest, administered by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA).


The Committee has judged the painting to be of outstanding aesthetic importance, closely connected with the UK’s heritage and culture.


The Committee awarded a starred rating to the painting meaning that every possible effort should be made to raise enough money to keep it in the country.


Modern Rome - Campo Vaccino, was Turner’s culminating image of Rome, the last work to emerge from his long fascination with the city. The painting, which depicts a panorama of the Eternal City from the Capitoline Hill, across the Forum and into the distance, was painted in 1839, a decade after Turner returned to England from his second and last visit to the city. From the shimmering mist enveloping the city, temples, churches and monuments come into view, revealing a magisterial panorama of the city through a dazzling rendering of Italian light and atmosphere.


This highly significant painting, in excellent condition, has only been in two private collections since it was painted, and until recently was on long-term loan to the National Gallery of Scotland, where it played a vital part in the displays of Romantic and 19th century painting.   


Lord Inglewood, Chairman of the Reviewing Committee, said: 


“If one needed evidence of Turner’s greatness as an artist, this is it. Modern Rome - Campo Vaccino is an astonishingly beautiful painting that underlines Turner’s thoughts and experiences of Rome, and in turn it has played a fundamental part in forming our perception of Turner and his work. Whilst this country holds a good part of the artist’s oeuvre, there are very few of his paintings in this country of this quality and in such fine condition. In addition in a single painting it sums up Northern Europe’s centuries old attitude towards the Mediterranean and the Classical World and its seduction by them.”


The decision on the export licence application for the painting will be deferred for a period ending on 2 February 2011 inclusive. This period may be extended until 2 August 2011 inclusive if a serious intention to raise funds with a view to making an offer to purchase the painting at the recommended price of £29,721,250 [excluding VAT (£30,284,968.75 including VAT)] is expressed.


Offers from public bodies for less than the recommended price through the private treaty sale arrangements, where appropriate, may also be considered by the Culture Minister.  Such purchases frequently offer substantial financial benefit to both parties by the sharing of tax advantages.


Anyone interested in making an offer to purchase the painting should contact the owner’s agent through:

The Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest is an independent body, serviced by MLA, which advises the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport on whether a cultural object, intended for export, is of national importance under specified criteria. Where the Committee finds that an object meets one or more of the criteria, it will normally recommend that the decision on the export licence application should be deferred for a specified period. An offer may then be made from within the United Kingdom at or above the fair market price.






The Reviewing Committee recommended that the export decision be deferred on the grounds that the painting is so closely connected with our history and national life that its departure would be a misfortune; is of outstanding aesthetic importance, and of outstanding significance for the study of Turner, the British enthusiasm for Italy in general and Rome in particular, and the relationship between painting and poetry explored by Turner and the Romantic generation.






Paired with the artist’s Ancient Rome; Agrippina Landing with the Ashes of Germanicus (Tate, Turner Bequest), Modern Rome was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1839 accompanied by a slightly altered quotation from the fourth canto of Byron’s Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage:






The moon is up, yet it is not night,

The sun divides the day with her.


Byron was Turner’s favourite modern poet, whose words seemed to compliment his pictures and from whom he often took epigraphs. While responding to the dualism of mood implied by Byron’s lines, Turner’s changes from the original line ‘sunset divides the sky…’ to ‘sun’ and ‘day’  times the picture to morning rather than evening, suggesting rebirth rather than decline.

Sport England
’s role in the planning process, figures have revealed.


Local councils have to consult the organisation about proposed developments that would affect a sports field.


Sport England figures show 94% of the 1,460 completed planning applications they were involved in during 2010-11 resulted in better or safeguarded sports provision.


“Playing fields are where many people have their first sporting experience and protecting them is vital if we are to deliver a lasting legacy throughout the country from the London 2012 Games,” Sport England’s Chair Richard Lewis said.


“I’m pleased the latest figures again show that the safeguards we have in place are working and allowing people to continue enjoying sport.”


Playing fields in figures




In 53% of cases where Sport England initially objected to a planning application, negotiations led to improved sports provision.


Of the 211 applications where an objection was sustained, 70 were withdrawn or refused planning permission.


Only 6% per cent of applications had a detrimental impact on sport.




Sport England is also helping to revamp sports fields through its 
Protecting Playing Fields
 fund, part of the 
Places People Play
 Olympic legacy programme. It has already protected and improved more than 500 pitches and nearly 1,900 acres, with two more rounds of funding to come.

The four UK capital cities along with Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds & Bradford, Newcastle and Manchester will share the funding. It will help provide businesses with ultrafast broadband (at least 80-100Mbps) and well as high speed wireless Internet access.


The allocations to each city are:




Belfast £13.7m


Birmingham £10m


Bristol £11.3m


Cardiff £11m


Edinburgh £10.7m


Leeds & Bradford (joint bid) £14.4m


London £25m


Manchester £12m


Newcastle £6m




Culture Secretary Maria Miller said: “Fast broadband is essential for growth, and is key to the country’s economic future. These ten cities have produced ambitious and comprehensive plans, which will turn them into digital leaders, and give their local economies a real boost. The new investment will help put these cities at the centre of the digital stage, competing for jobs and investment with the best in the world.”


The Government is transforming the UK’s digital infrastructure as a key driver of jobs and economic growth. It is investing a total of £830 million in delivering the best broadband in Europe and extending mobile coverage. 


Today’s allocations follow an announcement by the Culture Secretary last week of plans to rip up the planning red tape that is delaying the roll-out of superfast broadband around the country.


The ten cities’ plans include taking ultrafast broadband access to around an extra 230,000 residential and 55,000 business premises as well as high speed wireless to even more.  All the plans are due to be delivered by 2015.


The names of the ten cities, along with indicative allocations, were announced in this year’s Budget following a competition. Today’s announcement sets out the amount of Government investment allocated to each city. The cities are all required to provide additional resources towards the project.


A second super-connected city fund was also announced in the Budget, which will see around a further £50 million shared between ten smaller cities.


Notes to Editors






The total sum allocated to the 10 cities is £114.1 million, which exceeds the £100 million originally allocated to the first round of the super-connected fund.  We expect to manage the costs within the overall £830 million available for broadband.






A total of 14 cities were eligible to apply for the first round of super-connected city funding
. They were the four capitals, the eight English core cities and other cities with more than 150,000 dwellings - Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh, London, Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Sheffield, Bradford and Glasgow. 
The successful cities, along with an indicative range of allocations, were announced in this year’s Budget
.






The Government wants the UK to have the best broadband network in Europe by 2015 and the fastest of any major European country. The Comprehensive Spending Review allocated £530 million for investing in broadband over this Parliament. The funding for super-connected cities is additional investment. A further £150 million is being invested in extending mobile coverage to areas of the UK that currently have no mobile coverage.






The second round of super-connected funding
 is open to cities with a Royal Charter and more than 45,000 homes and businesses, or more than 35,000 homes and businesses in Northern Ireland. The eligible cities are Aberdeen, Brighton & Hove, Cambridge, Chelmsford, Coventry, Derby, Dundee, Exeter, Gloucester, Kingston upon Hull, Leicester, Londonderry / Derry, Newport, Norwich, Oxford, Perth, Peterborough, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Preston, Salford, Southampton, Stoke-on-Trent, Sunderland, Swansea, Wolverhampton and York.

Government’s final quarterly economic report 
before the Games show London 2012 is on track to be delivered on time and under budget.


The overall funding package for the Games remains at £9.298 billion with £476 million of uncommitted contingency available.


The anticipated final cost of the 
Olympic Delivery Authority’s 
(ODA) construction and transport programme is £6.761 billion - a decrease of £16 million on the previous quarter.


Savings made by the ODA up to 31 May this year have now topped the billion pound mark in total, reaching £1.004 billion.


“With only 44 days to go before the Olympics it is fantastic news that there is still £476 million of contingency funds left,” said Culture Secretary 
Jeremy Hunt
. “Britain has proved that not only can we put on a great show for the world to watch like we did with the Jubilee but that we can also deliver big construction projects on time and on budget.”


Olympics Minister 
Hugh Robertson
 added: “The transformation of the previously contaminated land into the Olympic Park on time and under budget is a great success story for UK plc. I would like to thank all those who have worked so hard to deliver this project in such an exemplary manner.


“We can now look forward to a summer of sport built upon the firm foundations set down by the ODA, LOCOG and everyone else involved in the project.”

The 
Cutty Sark
, the world’s last surviving tea clipper which was launched in 1869, will open to visitors for the first time since 2006.


The complex conservation project was funded by a number of organisations including £5 million of support from DCMS and £25 million of lottery money from the 
Heritage Lottery Fund
.


The ship will now come under the operational management of 
Royal Museums Greenwich
 (RMG).


Culture Minister 
Ed Vaizey
, who visited the ship this morning alongside Heritage Minister 
John Penrose
, said the restoration was an “incredible achievement”.


“It is very fitting that this extraordinary example of British design and ingenuity should be reopened in time for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee and the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games,” Mr Vaizey added. “We owe a debt of gratitude to everyone who has made this restoration possible, whether directly or through the National Lottery, and my personal thanks go to Lord Sterling for the leadership he has shown as Chair of the Cutty Sark Trust. I am delighted that DCMS has been able to play its part with a grant of £5m to support this remarkable project.”


Lord Sterling, Chairman of RMG and the Cutty Sark Trust said: “Cutty Sark holds a unique place in the heart for the people of Greenwich, Great Britain and indeed the rest of the world, and it is splendid that she is re-joining the London skyline once again.”


Visitors will be able to walk underneath the Cutty Sark for the first time as the ship has been raised 11 feet into the air to relieve the keel of the weight of the ship and preserve her unique shape. Inside the ship, they can explore new interactive exhibitions.

Jeremy Hunt
 kicked off a nationwide ‘2012 tour’ in Penrith.


Addressing more than 100 hoteliers, businesses and tourism bodies from across Cumbria, the Secretary of State said that the region was one of the most stunning parts of the country, and that there were big wins to be had in 2012 for Cumbria’s tourism industry in particular.


He also revealed that the region would feature in major international and national marketing campaigns to promote UK tourism in 2012, and urged local tourism firms to sign up to a new 20.12 per cent discount scheme.


The event, which was hosted by Eric Robson, Chairman of 
Cumbria Tourism
, showcased the business, tourism, cultural and sporting opportunities that the Games bring.  It also featured internationally acclaimed Cumbrian drumming band 
Boom Dang
.


Other speakers included 
John Penrose
 (Tourism Minister), Ruth Mackenzie OBE (Director of the 
Cultural Olympiad
), Andy Worthington (Chair of the 
North West Steering Group for the 2012 Games
) and James Berresford (Chief Executive of 
VisitEngland
).


Jeremy Hunt said: “Last year, 40 million visitors came to Cumbria, bringing £2 billion into the local economy. Next year, we can do even better.  We have a once-in-a-generation chance to show the world the very best of Cumbria - from the stunning scenery of the Solway Coast and The Lakes, to cultural and historic sites like Dove Cottage and Tullie House, and Michelin-starred restaurants like Holbeck Ghyll and Sharrow Bay.


“And with so much going on, including the fantastic Lakes Alive spectacular on Windermere, 2012 is also the perfect time for more of us to holiday at home. That’s why I am working with VisitEngland on a new 20.12 per cent discount scheme to encourage more people to experience the delights of Cumbria and other parts of the UK.  Lots of household names are already signed up, and I urge local tourism businesses to get on board as well.”


VisitEngland
’s Chief Executive, James Berresford said:


“I’m delighted to be here in Cumbria with the Secretary of State, Jeremy Hunt, and Tourism Minister, John Penrose.  This exciting tourism road-show launches England’s most high profile campaign to boost domestic tourism, and is designed to highlight the fantastic experiences Britons can enjoy on their doorsteps.  Next year offers the tourism industry a number of fantastic opportunities.  Not only will England be showcased to billions all over the world, but we have the opportunity to grow domestic tourism by inspiring Britons to rediscover England and take a holiday at home next year.  Our job as the national tourist board is to work with the industry to harness the pride we know is felt by local residents and to inspire them to act as ambassadors for their destinations for next year and beyond.”


Eric Robson, Chairman of 
Cumbria Tourism
 said: ‘We are pleased to be hosting the minister in Cumbria as he starts his nationwide tour. We are proud that he has chosen to launch this campaign, designed to boost England’s tourism offer, in the heart of the Lake District, Cumbria, one of England’s premier holiday destinations. The campaign is about highlighting what England has to offer, and it is a fantastic opportunity for us. We offer outstanding accommodation, fantastic local food and drink, adventure, culture and heritage, and we have much to show the millions of visitors who come here each year.  With Britain’s favourite view, deepest and longest lakes, highest mountains, stunning landscape and inspirational coastline, what we have to offer is unparalleled anywhere else in England. Cumbria, simply put, has it all. So we encourage visitors to think of us and come linger a while and discover our all-year-round destination experiences in one of England’s favourite visitor destinations.’’


Mr Hunt also visited 
Richard Rose Central Academy
 in Carlisle today, where he hosted a school sport summit, along with wheelchair basketball athlete Mark Fosbrook.  At the event Mr Fosbrook spoke about how sport was his inspiration, and urged schools to 
sign up for the new School Games school sport competition
.  Using the inspiration of London’s Olympics, the competition is helping to transform competitive sport in schools and get more young people playing sport. 


Mr Hunt added: “The School Games will leave a real lasting legacy from London’s Olympic and Paralympic Games.  They will transform sport in school, bringing back competition and getting rid of ‘prizes for all’.  There is still time for schools to sign up for the competition, which will have its first finals in the Olympic Park next year.”


The events in Cumbria today were the first in a series of events around the country hosted by Mr Hunt, to help all parts of the country make the most of the opportunities of the Games, and to urge schools to sign up to the School Games competition.


Mark Fosbrook
, Paralympian and Sporting Champion said:


“The School Games promises to offer a range of opportunities for young people to learn more about themselves through a series of well organised competitions. I have seen many youngsters grow in self-confidence by being part of a team, working as volunteers and officials. As a Sporting Champion, I hope that I can support young people in local communities to develop their talents and get into sport!”

The Communications Minister will tomorrow meet with key industry figures to discuss the work being done to move to IPv6 and ensure there is a co-ordinated approach.


Ed Vaizey said: “The Internet has transformed our lives.  The way we communicate, work, shop and do business have been completely changed.


“We must ensure we create the conditions that allow the Internet to continue to grow and for companies to produce fresh innovations.


“IPv6 is key to the continued growth of the Internet.  It is essential industry deals with the switch-over before there is an impact on the Internet.


“I look forward to hearing from industry about the work already being done on this crucial issue.”


In February this year the last blocks of IPv4 addresses were allocated to the regional bodies that distribute them to companies and users. 


A lack of access to IP addresses would limit the ability to connect new customers and devices to the Internet.


Failure to switch to IPv6 could make some new innovations, for example Machine to Machine communications, difficult to implement. This sort of application would require millions of IP addresses to become widespread.


The Government has supported the creation of 6UK, a not-for-profit organisation that aims to help with the smooth transition to IPv6.


Tomorrow’s World IPv6 Day aims to raise awareness and major organisations including Google, Facebook and Yahoo will use IPv6 for the day.


Notes to Editors






Machine to Machine Communications allows devices to communicate with each other or a central point on their own. This could involve millions of new devices being connected to the Internet so IPv6 would have to be used.

.


Culture Secretary 
Jeremy Hunt
 set out plans for colourful and striking signs - which could include full colour photographs - to showcase the region’s best features.


Six counties (Cornwall, Cumbria, Derbyshire, Devon, Norfolk and North Yorkshire) will spearhead the move in a £2 million pilot scheme run by DCMS and the Department for Transport. The signs will be installed in pilot areas by next spring.


“The current signs greeting visitors as they travel around are dull, often boring and do little to entice tourists,” Mr Hunt said. “We need to update them to something that is both attractive and better at selling what is great about our tourist destinations.”


He added: “The new signs will give a fresher and more welcoming feel to England’s regions. Counties will be able to highlight the things that make them special, whether it’s cultural or heritage attractions, or an activity that is special to the area.”


Further ahead, the Government also wants to improve traditional brown tourism signs to ensure they focus on genuine tourist attractions, and a review of the existing guidelines is underway.

The report, 
Philanthropy Beyond London
, has been written by the chair of the Birmingham Opera Company, Peter Phillips.  It is the second in a series of three independent studies, commissioned by the Government, looking at new and innovative ways of boosting arts philanthropy.


London-based cultural organisations receive approximately 80 per cent of all philanthropy generated in England, largely due to their size, professional approach and the concentration of philanthropic sources in the capital. In 2010/11, private investment in culture in areas outside London totalled just over £125 million, compared to £488 million in the capital. Similarly, philanthropy makes up nine per cent of arts organisations’ income nationally, but when broken down regionally this drops to 5.1 per cent in some areas, compared to 12.2 per cent in London.


Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport Maria Miller said: “We are incredibly lucky in this country to have such a vibrant arts sector, which underpins our unique cultural heritage.  That is not just about the big organisations in London, incredible creativity can be seen the length and breadth of the country.  It is vital that we look at innovative ways to support those important cultural organisations.


“Government funding has always had - and will continue to have - a huge role in supporting the arts.  But in these tough economic times it is more important than ever for arts bodies to develop the fundraising skills that mean they are not reliant on public funding alone.  I am very grateful to Peter Phillips for this helpful report, which contains recommendations designed to help arts bodies create more sustainable funding base.”


The report makes 19 recommendations to regional cultural organisations, the Government and Arts Council England, including:






CEOs should examine their own role and ensure that leadership of fundraising is a key priority of their time, working closely with fundraising staff, chair and board as a team to develop fundraising strategy and its execution.






Organisations should consider introducing ‘friends’ schemes and, where already established, focus on the development of individual members to higher levels of giving. Smaller organisations for whom the cost of administering a scheme may be too high might consider the practicality of forming joint “artform” or heritage membership schemes with like-minded cultural organisations.






Arts Council England and DCMS to consider ways of raising public awareness of the charitable status of cultural organisations, underlining their place alongside other charities deserving of people’s support.






Peter Phillips said: “I was very pleased to be asked by the Culture Secretary to research and write this report and I thank colleagues in the cultural and heritage sector for helping to inform its content. With the current pressures on central and local government spending, I hope that it will provide some useful and practical pointers for organisations, particularly smaller ones, on developing the knowledge and skills to access philanthropy beyond the high concentration of wealth in London, building on the essential public funding of core costs, and on their own commercial income. The report offers no quick fixes, but aims for progressive improvement in accessing Philanthropy beyond London in the years to come.”

During a visit to the Olympic Village today, the Minister said:




The Olympic Village looks fantastic and you can just imagine the energy it will have when 17,000 athletes and staff move in here next summer for the Olympic Games. But what is most important about the Village is that it will be a real legacy from London’s Games, by providing affordable and private housing after 2012. It is yet another example of how we continue to deliver on our promise to leave behind real and lasting benefits from London 2012.




The Olympic Village lies next to the Olympic Park and will house around 17,000 Olympic and 6,000 Paralympic athletes and officials during the Games, as well as providing shops, restaurants, medical, media and leisure facilities, and large areas of open space.


After the Games, the apartments will be adapted for permanent use as part of a lasting legacy being created in east London. The Village, comprising 2,818 new homes across 11 individually designed plots, will become a new and complete London neighbourhood offering homes that will be affordable and privately rented or owned. Community facilities, newly created parklands and some of the best transport connections in the capital will help deliver this sustainable and thriving neighbourhood.


Dennis Hone, chief executive of the Olymic Delivery Authority, said:




The construction of the Village is on track to be completed early next year. This is a unique development which combines and integrates private and affordable housing of the highest quality. It represents one of the strongest legacies of the Games, building a new community that will enhance our capital city and the lives of its people in the decades ahead.

Fujitsu
 plans to build the new superfast, fibre optic broadband network, which will be underpinned by 
Cisco
 technology.


Virgin Media
 and 
TalkTalk
 are set to provide internet packages through the network to customers in remote parts of the UK. Other broadband providers will also be given the opportunity for wholesale purchase to enable them to offer services on the network.


Mr Vaizey
 said the move would help to improve the economic and social prospects of homes and businesses in the affected areas.


“The whole of the UK should be able to share in the benefits of broadband and we are determined to make that happen by the end of the Parliament,” the Minister added. “That is why the Government is investing over £500 million in taking superfast broadband to everyone.

 

“I am delighted that Fujitsu along with Virgin Media, TalkTalk and Cisco share the Government’s vision. The collaboration between these companies was exactly the sort of ambition and innovation the Government wanted to stimulate by removing barriers to broadband rollout. Fujitsu and their industry partners are pledging a substantial investment in the UK and it represents a deep commitment to the future success of this country.”


Under the proposals, Fujitsu will run fibre optic cabling directly to the home rather than to the local street cabinet in the vast majority of areas, allowing speeds of one gigabit (1 Gbps) and the potential to increase to speeds of 10 Gbps and beyond.


Duncan Tait, CEO of Fujitsu said: “There is a unique opportunity for the UK to re-establish itself as a world leader by having the world’s most advanced fibre network. If done correctly, this can be a key vehicle to accelerate recovery in the UK and bring genuine choice to generations of communities starved of participating fully in the UK economy. We believe our approach, in collaboration with these major industry leaders, will provide a future-proofed network for at least the next 20 to 30 years.”

Nearly five million homes across Greater London and parts of the Home Counties - almost 12 million TV sets - will now benefit from extra channels and better picture quality.


It means almost 90 per cent of UK households will be covered, with the final switchover taking place in Northern Ireland on 24 October.


“The London switchover has been the biggest undertaken in the UK so far, with almost 12 million viewers now receiving a better picture quality, fantastic new channels and a range of exciting extra services, “ Communications Minister 
Ed Vaizey
 said.


“By Autumn, the last few remaining regions will make the change to an all-digital future and I’m delighted at how smooth the process has been to date.”


DCMS has been working with industry since 2001 to mastermind the switchover and set the timetable for the UK to move to digital-only television, one region at a time, between 2008 and 2012.

Regulated Entertainment
, which proposes scrapping much of the Licensing Act 2003 requiring people to apply and sometimes pay for licences for many events where there is little or no risk of trouble.


These include activities such as:




School plays, children’s films shown to toddler groups, school discos where tickets are sold to raise funds for the PTA, or exhibitions of dancing by children at school fetes;


Folk duos in pubs, pianists in restaurants and brass bands playing in public parks on Sunday afternoons; and even


Punch and Judy shows and performances by street artists.




This announcement does not affect the current rules on the licensing of alcohol supply and sale.


Tourism Minister John Penrose said:




Current entertainment licensing rules are a mess.  Pointless bureaucracy and licence fees imposed on community groups trying to put on simple amateur productions and fund-raising events, sap energy and deaden people’s desire to get involved. The Government’s Red Tape Challenge, is leading to deregulation across all sectors of the economy - and in this case it will make it easier for new talent to get started and help pubs to diversify into other activities to help weather the present tough economic climate. 






That’s why I want to set a match to all this nonsense, and trust sensible people to act sensibly, with regulation retained only where rightly needed to keep audiences and performances safe.




‘Regulated Entertainment’ looks at all currently licensable activities such as performances of plays, live music and dance; exhibition of films; indoor sports, boxing and wrestling (indoor and outdoor); and public playing of recorded music, and asks the question ‘what would happen if this activity were no longer licensable?’  Where there is no good reason to continue with the present regime, the presumption will be in favour of abolition.


However, the Government is also clear that there will be no relaxation on the rules controlling gatherings of more than 5,000 people, boxing and wrestling, and things classed as sexual entertainment.


John Penrose continued:




Before we press ahead, it’s important we get the views of those working in the industry, and to make sure that the principles of public safety, prevention of public nuisance and the protection of children from harm are safeguarded.






Our starting point is a simple one: if there’s no good reason for any of the rules and restrictions in this important area, our presumption should be to scrap them.




Notes to Editors




The 
Red Tape Challenge
 was launched by the Prime Minister on 7 April. It gives the public the chance to have their say on some of the more than 21,000 regulations that affect their everyday lives.


The campaign has six cross cutting themes that affect all businesses and are open throughout the whole of the campaign. The six cross cutting themes are:






Employment law;


Pensions;


Company law;


Equalities;


Health and Safety; and


Environment legislation.






For each sector theme, there is an experienced ‘sector champion’ who will provide expert knowledge on the issues faced by those on the shop floor. The champion acts as an intermediary between the sector and Government and help to direct the web-based debates and discussions.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS


Feargal Sharkey, Chief Executive, 
UK Music
 said:




We are delighted that Government has adopted such a forward-thinking approach. Enabling live music to flourish has potential to drive social cohesion, entrepreneurialism and economic growth. UK Music warmly welcomes this consultation and all other measures that would remove red tape for the benefit of musicians and creative talent.




Robin Simpson, Chief Executive of 
Voluntary Arts
 said:




In recent years the escalating burden of entertainment licensing and similar regulation has become a major obstacle to amateur arts groups putting on small local events and performances. From a few acoustic musicians playing in a pub, to public workshops and small local festivals, the complexity and cost of regulation originally intended for much larger-scale events has had a detrimental effect on hundreds of thousaands of volunteers who give their time for the benefit of their communities.






Voluntary Arts therefore welcomes these proposals to reduce the regulatory burden on the tens of thousands of amateur arts group across the country who contribute so much to the Government’s vision of a Big Society.




Christine Payne, General Secretary of 
Equity
, said:




We commend these proposals as a visionary solution to a long running problem in the live entertainment sector. Freeing up venues to put on plays, live music, dance performances and film will provide a much needed boost for our communities, it will help to create more opportunities for artists and will enable young performers to get the exposure needed to kickstart their careers”.




David Butler, OBE, chief executive of the 
National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations
 (NCPTA) said:




NCPTA is delighted by - and fully supports - proposals for the deregulation of entertainment licensing in the UK.  These requirements have done much to hinder the work of Parent Teacher Associations (PTAs) which have limited their activities because of the administrative burden imposed.  Additionally, the costs of obtaining a licence have reduced the funds raised to benefit education and children.  NCPTA has long argued that there is insufficient risk posed by PTA activities - for example, children’s discos, family film nights or teenage band contests - to justify the regulatory regime.   The Government is to be congratulated on taking this step which will be significant in allowing PTA activity to flourish.




Brigid Simmonds OBE, Chairman, 
Tourism  Alliance
 said:




The Government deserves real credit for looking at ways of sweeping away some of the red tape that gets in the way of music and other types of entertainment. The whole tourism industry in Britain could be an engine for creating new jobs, so removing restrictions on providing entertainment in pubs, schools, historic houses, arts and other venues would be a great move.






Venues wanting to put on music or other entertainments often have to apply to their Local Authority for permission - an unnecessary burden for business and council alike. If the Government were to sweep these unnecessary restrictions away, this would be great for the whole tourism industry. 






I hope the Government makes good progress in cutting this red tape. With the Olympics and the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee, next year is hugely important for the whole tourism and hospitality sector.




Deborah Annetts, Chief Executive of the 
Incorporated Society of Musicians
 (ISM) said:




We welcome the consultation and look forward to these ambitious proposals enabling musicians to perform across England and Wales. This is fantastic news for all who have been campaigning against the costly bureaucratic licensing regime that stifled music and harmed our economy.

The Art Fund and the Crafts Council have today launched this year’s £75,000 
Art Fund Collect scheme
, which aims to boost public collections with craft.


Curators from museums and galleries across the country are being invited to apply for exclusive preview access to COLLECT, Europe’s leading art fair for contemporary objects, in order to select one work they would like for their museum.


Shortlisted curators will be given an hour before all other visitors to visit the 31 galleries of works at the fair. They will then present their chosen item to the Art Fund Collect judging panel, who will decide which objects have been best presented and most merit joining a public museum collection. In 2011, eight curators each had an object for their public collections funded through Art Fund Collect.


Stephen Deuchar, Director of the 
Art Fund
, said: “The Art Fund’s collaboration with the Crafts Council through Art Fund Collect has been instrumental in ensuring that some of the most innovative and accomplished contemporary craft practitioners are now represented in museum collections, and we look forward to building on these fantastic achievements with this year’s edition of the programme.”


Rosy Greenlees, Executive Director of the 
Crafts Council
, added: “Since its inception, £275,000 has been spent through Art Fund Collect. The scheme has enabled the purchase of 22 works of contemporary craft to be placed in 16 museums and galleries across the UK - significantly enhancing these collections.”


Curators have until 14 March 2012 to submit their applications to take part. The shortlist, compiled by the judging panel, will be announced in April.

Funding of up to £12.5m has been made available to the Greater London Authority (GLA) to support its plans for the Games. This funding will be used to provide facilities for the non-accredited media, to improve accessibility on London’s Southbank and to recruit and train 8,000 volunteers to help visitors to the city at Games-time.


Construction of the venues and infrastructure for the Games is 83 per cent complete. The Velodrome and the Olympic Stadium are finished and the ODA also announced today that the handball arena is now complete.


Minister for Sport and the Olympics, Hugh Robertson said:


“The beginning of this year has seen considerable progress on the Olympic Park with two of the centre-piece venues finished and the handball arena now complete. The ODA has continued its focus on costs - driving efficiencies across the programme resulting in a £35m reduction in the anticipated final cost.”


Olympic Delivery Authority Chief Executive, Dennis Hone, said:


“Today we can announce the handball arena as the third venue to be completed on the Olympic Park, with the project now 83 per cent complete in what is the ODA’s final year of construction. We are on track to deliver an excellent platform for the Games, although are not complacent as we push ahead on the final straight.”


In total £830m in savings have been achieved by the ODA since the November 2007 baseline budget was agreed, including £49m in the last quarter.


As of March 2011 the gross allocation of contingency for the ODA programme was £1.069bn. The remaining balance of ODA contingency now stands at £476m. This follows changes to the breakdown of the overall funding package in the 2010 Spending Review in which the funding available exclusively to the ODA was reduced by £684m. Contingency totalling £3m was released to the ODA during the last quarter for transformation works on the Park after the Games and site preparation works for the sponsors’ areas on the Park.


In addition to the remaining ODA contingency, there is £629.5m potentially available as contingency for other cross-programme issues that may arise, including any major changes in security circumstances. This contingency is part of the £9.298bn funding package, and reflects the programme’s changing focus from construction to operational requirements.


The changes in the ODA’s AFC are as a result of a number of changes including:




a saving of £17m from South Park site preparation;


forecast savings of £3m on Stratford Regional Station upgrade;


a forecast saving for logistics and security for park construction of £7m and £3m respectively.




The AFC also includes a contribution of £55m from the ODA to operational costs incurred by LOCOG as a consequence of the reorganisation of temporary venues in 2007. The reduction in the number of temporary venues created savings of more than £200m for the public sector funding package but resulted in additional costs for LOCOG such as venue rental, additional security, overlay and transport costs that they had not budgeted for.


Notes to Editors






London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games Quarterly Report May 2011
.






This report covers the period January 1 2011 to 31 March 2011.






The public sector funding package for the Games announced in March 2007 was £9.325 billion. On 24 May 2010, the Government announced that it would be reduced by £27m to £9.298bn.






The 2010 Spending Review made provision for all known Olympic programme cost requirements and pressures at the time. As we set out in the November 2010 Quarterly Report, contingency will continue to be strictly controlled and will only be released to meet costs that are essential for the delivery of the Games, where they cannot reasonably be met from existing budgets.






As was announced in the 2010/11 Annual Report in February 2011, following the finalisation of additional park operations responsibilities LOCOG will receive £67m from the PSFP for work such as venue operations, licensing and testing. They will also receive £36m from the funding package to contribute to the cost of using the Olympic Village and to meet costs arising from changes to venues that generated savings for the ODA. A further £27m is being retained by Government to cover further cost pressures that may arise in staging the Games.

They will begin the process of forming a new tentative list based on the 38 nominations put forward earlier in the year.


John Penrose said:


“The variety and unique nature of the UK’s heritage is recognised around the world. But if we’re to succeed in getting more UK sites awarded World Heritage Status we have to make sure the strength of the nominations we put forward are second to none. I’m in no doubt that the expert panel chaired by Sue Davies will do a fantastic job in whittling down the list to ensure we have the very best chance of succeeding in front of UNESCO in the future.”


Once the Tentative List has been completed it will be submitted to UNESCO. Nominations from this list will then be put forward from 2012 for inclusion on the World Heritage List. It’s hoped a new UK Tentative List will be completed by Spring next year.


Notes to Editors






The 
list of 38 places that have put themselves forward for consideration for the tentative list
 can be found on the DCMS website. 






The Government has conducted a review of its UK World Heritage Policy. The aim was to help determine whether the UK should continue to nominate sites for World Heritage status and what more we should do for existing sites. The review considered the UK’s approach to World Heritage, the costs and benefits of World Heritage status, informed by research undertaken by Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PWC), on the management, protection and funding of sites, and the policy for future nominations.






The Government proposes to submit a new Tentative List to UNESCO in 2011, with a view to re-commencing nominating from 2012. Following this, it proposes to continue to make nominations to the World Heritage List, though not necessarily every year.






The full list of the nine panel members are:










Sue Davies: who will Chair the panel- and is Chief Executive of Wessex Archaeology Ltd and Chair of the United Kingdom National Commission for UNESCO’s Culture Committee.






Dr Peter Fowler: an academic writer and researcher in archaeological, agrarian history and heritage fields. He is an international consultant and is currently adviser to three international bids for World Heritage Status.

162,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/school-discipline-new-guidance-for-teachers,School discipline: new guidance for teachers,"The Department for Education publishes the final, clearer guidance for teachers on how they should deal with bad behaviour in schools. ",press_release,2011-07-11T01:00:00+01:00,Department for Education,"

More than 600 pages of guidance slashed to just 52 pages




Today the Department for Education has published the final, clearer guidance for teachers on how they should deal with bad behaviour. This guidance will be used by schools from the start of the new academic year this coming September.


Behaviour in good schools is not a serious problem but overall it remains a big concern for parents. Evidence shows there is much to do. For instance:




Nearly 1,000 children are suspended from school for abuse and assault every school day.[1]


Persistent disruptive behaviour accounts for nearly a third of all cases of permanent exclusions in secondary schools.[2]


Major assaults on staff have reached a five-year high with 44 having to be rushed to hospital with serious injuries last year.[3]


False allegations have been made against one-in-four school staff by a pupil. One-in-six have had an allegation made by a member of a pupil’s family.[4]


Two thirds of teachers say bad behaviour is driving professionals out of the classroom.[5]


One in four children have been bullied at school and one in five have been victims of bullying outside of school.[6]




Previous behaviour and search guidance was more than 600 pages long. It left teachers confused about their powers under the law. It also made it much harder for schools to have clear and effective discipline policies.


The Government’s new guidance is 52 pages long and now reflects feedback from teachers, teacher unions and local authorities. It clearly sets out the roles and responsibilities for governing bodies, headteachers and teachers regarding behaviour and discipline. It unequivocally restores adult authority to the classroom. It makes clear:




Schools should not have a ‘no touch’ policy. It is often necessary or desirable for a teacher to touch a child (e.g. dealing with accidents or teaching musical instruments).


Teachers have a legal power to use reasonable force. They can use force to remove a pupil who is disrupting a lesson or to prevent a child leaving a classroom.


Heads can search without consent for an extended list of items including alcohol, illegal drugs and stolen property.


Heads have the power to discipline pupils who misbehave outside the schools premises and outside schools hours.


Schools must have measures in place to deal with bullying both in and outside of school.




The guidance also protects teachers from malicious allegations:




Heads can temporarily or permanently exclude pupils who make false allegations. In extreme circumstances, they can involve the police if there are grounds for believing a criminal offence has been committed.


Schools should not automatically suspend teachers accused of using force unreasonably where other alternatives exist.


All but the tiny number of the most complex cases should be resolved within three months and the vast majority should be resolved in four weeks.


Malicious, unsubstantiated or unfounded allegations should not be included in employment references.




The new Education Bill currently going through the House of Lords will also:




Extend teachers’ powers to search pupils for any items that have, or could be, used to cause harm or break the law, and for items banned by school rules.


Stop appeals panels sending excluded children back to the school from which they were excluded.


Give teachers anonymity when facing allegations.


Remove the requirement on schools to give parents 24 hours notice of detention.




Schools Minister Nick Gibb said:




This new, clear and concise guidance removes the red tape that has stopped teachers from being confident in maintaining discipline in the classroom. It will also help schools promote good behaviour.


We know that the majority of pupils are well-behaved and want others to behave well too. The role of the Government is to give schools the freedom and support they need to provide a safe and structured environment in which teachers can teach and children can learn.




Charlie Taylor, the Government’s Expert Adviser on Behaviour, said:




For far too long, teachers have been buried under guidance and reports on how to tackle bad behaviour. The new guidance will help teachers to be able to do their job without lessons being disrupted and schools to feel confident when they address behaviour issues.




Andrew Fielder, Principal at Sandy Hill Academy in St Austell, said:




The clarity that this document brings will help to reduce uncertainty in schools. It more clearly highlights rights and responsibilities. What we needed was concise, easily accessible support and guidance, not huge policy documents filled with copious amounts of prescriptive and largely irrelevant text.


Whilst that may have ticked boxes at the centre, it provided absolutely no help to the schools grappling with some of the most extreme behaviour problems imaginable.




Peter Barnes, headteacher at Oakgrove School in Milton Keynes, said:




Reducing the bureaucracy surrounding school behaviour policies allows schools to control their own agendas and apply what works for them in their individual contexts. It is about placing decision making in the hands of those people best placed to make those decisions.




Dame Yasmin Bevan, headteacher at Denbigh High School in Luton, said:




Uncertainty and confusion create bureaucracy. We need to clear the decks because we’re currently drowning under the weight of all the guidance an d regulations. If heads were able to have a clear list of what they have to do and read it would make the job much more attractive. Just hearing about the raft of things you think you need to do can be very off-putting for an inexperienced head.

Jeremy Hunt
 today urged businesses in Cumbria to make the most of the opportunity of the country hosting 
the Olympics
, kicking off his nationwide ‘2012 tour’ in Penrith.


Addressing more than 100 hoteliers, businesses and tourism bodies from across Cumbria, the Secretary of State said that the region was one of the most stunning parts of the country, and that there were big wins to be had in 2012 for Cumbria’s tourism industry in particular.


The event - hosted by 
Cumbria Tourism
 and with speakers from 
London 2012
, the 
Cultural Olympiad
 and 
VisitEngland
 - showcased the business, tourism, cultural and sporting opportunities that the Games bring.  It also featured internationally acclaimed Cumbrian drumming band 
Boom Dang
.


Tourism: 20.12 per cent discount scheme


He also revealed that the region would feature in major international and national marketing campaigns to promote UK tourism in 2012, and urged local tourism firms to sign up to 
a new 20.12 per cent discount scheme
.


Calling the 2012 Games a “once-in-a-generation chance to show the world the very best of Cumbria”, Jeremy Hunt also recommended a 2012 ‘staycation’: “with so much going on, including the fantastic 
Lakes Alive
 spectacular on Windermere, 2012 is also the perfect time for more of us to holiday at home.”  He continued: “Lots of household names are already signed up to the VisitEngland 20.12 per cent discount scheme, and I urge local tourism businesses to get on board as well. Last year, 40 million visitors came to Cumbria, bringing £2 billion into the local economy. Next year, we can do even better.”


School Games - bringing the Olympic spirit to schools in the North West


The Culture Secretary also dropped in on Richard Rose Central Academy in Carlisle, where he hosted a school sport summit, along with wheelchair basketball athlete 
Mark Fosbrook
.  At the event, Fosbrook urged schools to sign up for the new 
School Games school sport competition
. Using the inspiration of London’s Olympics, the competition is helping to transform competitive sport in schools and get more young people playing sport. 


Jeremy Hunt added: “The School Games will leave a real lasting legacy from London’s Olympic and Paralympic Games.  They will transform sport in school, bringing back competition and getting rid of ‘prizes for all’.  There is still time for schools to sign up for the competition, which will have its first finals in the Olympic Park next year.”


The events in Cumbria today were the first in a series of events around the country hosted by the Culture Secretary, to help all parts of the country make the most of the opportunities of the Games, and to urge schools to sign up to the School Games competition.

“
A Future for British Film - it begins with the audience
”, published by an independent review panel chaired by Lord Chris Smith, was commissioned last year by Culture Minister Ed Vaizey and has looked at how to ensure film is a sector which plays a full role in driving growth.


The audience has been placed at the heart of the review, and today’s recommendations aim to maximise audience access to films of every kind.


“Golden period of film”


“British film is going through a golden period,” Lord Smith said. “A run of British-made and British-based movies has been taking audiences around the world by storm.  But we cannot be complacent - this review highlights the things that the BFI, Government and industry can do to ensure that we continue to build on recent successes. British film is in prime position to make a major contribution to the growth of the UK’s economy, to the development of attractive and fulfilling careers for young people, and to the creation of job opportunities across the country.”


The report contains 56 recommendations to Government, industry and the 
British Film Institute

a new programme to bring film education into every school, giving every pupil the chance to see, understand and learn about British film;


a call for the major broadcasters to invest more in the screening, acquisition and production of independent British film;

buildings at the heart of operations during the Second World War at RAF Northolt were listed yesterday
 at Grade II by Tourism and Heritage Minister John Penrose.


“As we celebrate the 
70th anniversary of the Battle of Britain 
it seems entirely fitting to list these buildings which played such a pivotal role during the second World War and beyond,” said 
Mr Penrose
.


“Their national significance and historical importance merit the protection provided to them by listing and serve as a reminder of the great sacrifice, courage and determination showed by all those who worked at RAF Northolt during the war years.”


Churchill’s hangar


The buildings comprise a C-type hangar, former Squadron Watch office, and former ‘Z’ sector Operations Block. The hangar was used throughout WWII to house Churchill’s personal aircraft in which he flew to many important meetings of the Allied leaders. The Watch office which also served as the Aircraft Readiness room during the Second World War had an undisputed role in the Battle of Britain and was the building from which RAF Northolt’s pilots were scrambled.  And the Operations Block was the prototype of the ‘Dowding System,’ a method of communication allowing the command chain to communicate to intercept enemy aircraft, the first such system in the world.


“The nation has a duty to recognise the great sacrifices made by those serving in our Armed Forces,” said Secretary of State for Defence, 
Dr Liam Fox
. “The bravery that was displayed during the Battle of Britain continues to inspire generations of Servicemen and the Government’s decision to list these buildings will ensure the achievements of those who fought in the battle are never forgotten.”


The decision to list the buildings are on the basis of advice from 
English Heritage
. Grade II listing means that the architectural merit of the buildings must be taken account of in any future applications to develop the site.

National regulator established to ensure homes are built from safe materials


Action taken as Grenfell Inquiry reveals manufacturers ignored safety rules


Independent review will examine faults in the system and recommend how abuse can be prevented






Residents will be protected through the establishment of a national regulator which will ensure materials used to build homes will be made safer, the Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has announced today (19 January 2021).


The regulator for construction products will have the power to remove any product from the market that presents a significant safety risk and prosecute any companies who flout the rules on product safety.


This follows recent testimony to the Grenfell Inquiry that shone a light on the dishonest practice by some manufacturers of construction products, including deliberate attempts to game the system and rig the results of safety tests.


The regulator will have strong enforcement powers including the ability to conduct its own product-testing when investigating concerns. Businesses must ensure that their products are safe before being sold in addition to testing products against safety standards.


This marks the next major chapter in the government’s fundamental overhaul of regulatory systems. The progress on regulatory reform includes the publication of an ambitious draft Building Safety Bill, representing the biggest improvements to regulations in 40 years, and a new Building Safety Regulator that is already up and running in shadow form.


Housing Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:




The Grenfell Inquiry has heard deeply disturbing allegations of malpractice by some construction product manufacturers and their employees, and of the weaknesses of the present product testing regime.


We are establishing a national regulator to address these concerns and a review into testing to ensure our national approach is fit for purpose. We will continue to listen to the evidence emerging in the Inquiry, and await the judge’s ultimate recommendation - but it is already clear that action is required now and that is what we are doing.




Business Minister and Minister for London Paul Scully said:




We all remember the tragic scenes at Grenfell Tower, and the entirely justified anger which so many of us in London and throughout the UK continue to feel at the failings it exposed.


This must never happen again, which is why we are launching a new national regulator for construction materials, informed by the expertise that already exists within the Office for Product Safety and Standards.




Chair of the Independent Review of Building Regulations and Fire Safety Dame Judith Hackitt said:




This is another really important step in delivering the new regulatory system for building safety. The evidence of poor practice and lack of enforcement in the past has been laid bare. As the industry itself starts to address its shortcomings I see a real opportunity to make great progress in conjunction with the national regulator.




The regulator will operate within the Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS) which will be expanded and given up to £10 million in funding to establish the new function. It will work with the Building Safety Regulator and Trading Standards to encourage and enforce compliance.


The government has also commissioned an independent review to examine weaknesses in previous testing  regimes for construction products, and to recommend how abuse of the testing system can be prevented.


It will be led by a panel of experts with regulatory, technical and construction industry experience and will report later this year with recommendations.


Further information




The announcement follows recommendations in the 
Dame Judith Hackitt Review
 that industry and government must ensure that construction products are properly tested, certified, labelled and marketed.


In July 2020, the government published in draft the 
Building Safety Bill
. The Bill set out the biggest reforms to building safety regulation for a generation, and included provisions to strengthen and extend the scope of the powers available to government to regulate construction products.


Together, the Fire Safety Bill, Fire Safety Order and the Building Safety Bill will revolutionise safety and oversight for residents in all buildings.


The government has published an 
update of the progress and steps being taken since the Grenfell fire
.

Peer to Patent website
, an innovative new tool which allows experts from the scientific and technology community to view and comment on patent applications.


During the six month pilot up to 200 applications in the computing field will be gradually uploaded for review on the website.


These will include a range of inventions from computer mice to complex processor operations.


Baroness Wilcox said:


“Patent applications granted after using the Peer to Patent website review will be potentially stronger, giving businesses better protection to grow their innovative ideas. This will give the IPO access to a wider body of knowledge when deciding whether a patent should be granted.


“The pilot will give experts the opportunity to comment on patent applications and share their vital expertise before patents are granted. It will also mean that inventions already known in the wider community will be filtered out more readily.”


Read the Peer to Patent Blog
 which will give you the latest news, views and updates from the team.


The benefits of Peer to Patent




Opens up the patent examination process.


Improves the current system by helping to avoid the granting of overly broad patents.


Demonstrates the role that non-governmental experts can play in improving the patenting process.


Makes public participation relevant to actual decision making.


Provides the opportunity for the scientific and technical communities to research and discuss a patent application and share their knowledge with the IPO.




The UK pilot goes live today (1 June) and follows on from successful Peer to Patent websites that have already been run in the USA and Australia.


The project was developed by the New York Law School (NYLS) from the work of Professor Beth Noveck. The pilot will end on 31 December 2011.

Applies to England, Scotland and Wales


Guidance for Northern Ireland




The changes follow a 
public consultation on a review of The Highway Code to improve road safety for people walking, cycling and riding horses
. It ran from July to October 2020, and received more than 20,000 responses from the public, businesses and other organisations. Most people who responded were in favour of all the changes.


The changes were made to The Highway Code on Saturday 29 January 2022.


Here are 8 of the changes that you need to know about.


1. Hierarchy of road users




""""


The introduction section of The Highway Code has been updated to include 3 new rules about the new ‘hierarchy of road users’.


The hierarchy places those road users most at risk in the event of a collision at the top of the hierarchy. It does not remove the need for everyone to behave responsibly.


It’s important that all road users:




are aware of The Highway Code


are considerate to other road users


understand their responsibility for the safety of others




The 3 new rules are numbered H1, H2, and H3.




Read the new rules




Rule H1 (Introduction)


Rule H2 (Introduction)


Rule H3 (Introduction)






2. People crossing the road at junctions




""""


The updated code clarifies that:




when people are crossing or waiting to cross at a junction, other traffic should give way


if people  have started crossing and traffic wants to turn into the road, the people crossing   have priority and the traffic should give way


people driving, riding a motorcycle or cycling  must give way to people on a zebra crossing and people walking and cycling on a parallel crossing




A parallel crossing is similar to a zebra crossing, but includes a cycle route alongside the black and white stripes.




Read the updated rules




Rule H2 (Introduction)


Rule 8 (Rules for pedestrians)


Rule 19 (Rules for pedestrians)


Rule 170 (Using the road)


Rule 195 (Using the road)


Rule 206 (Road users requiring extra care)






3. Walking, cycling or riding in shared spaces




""""


There is new guidance in the code about routes and spaces which are shared by people walking, cycling and riding horses.


People cycling, riding a horse or driving a horse-drawn vehicle should respect the safety of people walking in these spaces, but people walking should also take care not to obstruct or endanger them.


People cycling are asked to:




not pass people walking, riding a horse or driving a horse-drawn vehicle closely or at high speed, particularly from behind


slow down when necessary and let people walking know they are there (for example, by ringing their bell)


remember that people walking may be deaf, blind or partially sighted


not pass a horse on the horse’s left






Read the updated rules




Rule H1 (Introduction)


Rule 13 (Rules for pedestrians)


Rule 62 (Rules for cyclists)


Rule 63 (Rules for cyclists)






4. Positioning in the road when cycling




""""


There is updated guidance for people cycling about positioning themselves which includes:




riding in the centre of their lane on quiet roads, in slower-moving traffic and at the approach to junctions or road narrowings


keeping at least 0.5 metres (just over 1.5 feet) away from the kerb edge (and further where it is safer) when riding on busy roads with vehicles moving faster than them




People cycling in groups


The updated code explains that people cycling in groups:




should be considerate of the needs of other road users when riding in groups


can ride 2 abreast - and it can be safer to do so, particularly in larger groups or when accompanying children or less experienced riders




People cycling are asked to be aware of people driving behind them and allow them to overtake (for example, by moving into single file or stopping) when it’s safe to do so.


People cycling passing parked vehicles


The updated code explains that people cycling should:




take care when passing parked vehicles, leaving enough room (a door’s width or 1 metre) to avoid being hit if a car door is opened


watch out for people walking into their path






Read the updated rules




Rule 67 (Rules for cyclists)


Rule 213 (Road users requiring extra care)






5. Overtaking when driving or cycling




You may cross a double-white line if necessary (provided the road is clear) to overtake someone cycling or riding a horse if they are travelling at 10 mph or less (Rule 129).


There is updated guidance on safe passing distances and speeds for people driving or riding a motorcycle when overtaking vulnerable road users, including:




leaving at least 1.5 metres (5 feet) when overtaking people cycling at speeds of up to 30mph, and giving them more space when overtaking at higher speeds


passing people riding horses or driving  horse-drawn vehicles at speeds under 10 mph and allowing at least 2 metres (6.5 feet) of space


allowing at least 2 metres (6.5 feet) of space and keeping to a low speed when passing people  walking in the road (for example, where there’s no pavement)




Wait behind them and do not overtake if it’s unsafe or not possible to meet these clearances.


People cycling passing slower-moving or stationary traffic


The updated code confirms that people cycling may pass slower-moving or stationary traffic on their right or left.


They should proceed with caution as people driving may not be able to see them. This is particularly important:




on the approach to junctions


when deciding whether it is safe to pass lorries or other large vehicles






Read the updated rules




Rule 67 (Rules for cyclists)


Rule 76 (Rules for cyclists)


Rule 163 (Using the road)


Rule 212 (Road users requiring extra care)


Rule 215 (Road users requiring extra care)






6. People cycling at junctions




""""


The code has been updated to clarify that when turning into or out of a side road, people cycling should give way to people walking who are crossing or waiting to cross.


There is new advice about new special cycle facilities at some junctions.


Some junctions now include small cycle traffic lights at eye-level height, which may allow cyclists to move separately from or before other traffic. People cycling are encouraged to use these facilities where they make their journey safer and easier.


There is also new guidance for people cycling at junctions with no separate facilities.


The code recommends that people cycling should proceed as if they were driving a vehicle where there are no separate cyclist facilities. This includes positioning themselves in the centre of their chosen lane, where they feel able to do this safely. This is to:




make them as visible as possible


avoid being overtaken where this would be dangerous




People cycling turning right


The code now includes advice for people cycling using junctions where signs and markings tell them to turn right in 2 stages. These are:




stage 1 - when the traffic lights turn green, go straight ahead to the location marked by a cycle symbol and turn arrow on the road, and then stop and wait


stage 2 - when the traffic lights on the far side of the junction (now facing the people cycling) turn green, complete the manoeuvre




People cycling have priority when going straight ahead at junctions


The code clarifies that when people cycling are going straight ahead at a junction, they have priority over traffic waiting to turn into or out of a side road, unless road signs or markings indicate otherwise.


People cycling are asked to watch out for people driving intending to turn across their path, as people driving ahead may not be able to see them.




Read the updated rules




Rule H2 (Introduction)


Rule H3 (Introduction)


Rule 73 (Rules for cyclists)


Rule 74 (Rules for cyclists)


Rule 75 (Rules for cyclists)


Rule 76 (Rules for cyclists)


Rule 167 (Using the road)


Rule 170 (Using the road)


Rule 211 (Road users requiring extra care)






7. People cycling, riding a horse and driving horse-drawn vehicles on roundabouts




Photo above licensed from Alamy. You cannot reuse this image.


The code has been updated to clarify that people driving or riding a motorcycle should give priority to people cycling on roundabouts. The new guidance will say people driving and or riding a motorcycle should:




not attempt to overtake people cycling within that person’s lane


allow people cycling to move across their path as they travel around the roundabout




The code already explained that people cycling, riding a horse  and driving a horse-drawn vehicle may stay in the left-hand lane of a roundabout when they intend to continue across or around the roundabout.


Guidance has been added to explain that people driving should take extra care when entering a roundabout to make sure they do not cut across people cycling, riding a horse or driving a horse-drawn vehicle who are continuing around the roundabout in the left-hand lane.




Read the updated rules




Rule 79 (Rules for cyclists)


Rule 167 (Using the road)


Rule 186 (Using the road)






8. Parking, charging and leaving vehicles




The code recommends a new technique when leaving vehicles. It’s sometimes called the ‘Dutch Reach’.


Where people driving or passengers in a vehicle are able to do so, they should open the door using their hand on the opposite side to the door they are opening. For example, using their left hand to open a door on their right-hand side.


This will make them turn their head to look over their shoulder behind them. They’re then less likely to cause injury to:




people cycling or riding a motorcycle passing on the road


people on the pavement




Using an electric vehicle charge point


For the first time, the code includes guidance about using electric vehicle charging points.


When using one, people should:




park close to the charge point and avoid creating a trip hazard for people walking from trailing cables


display a warning sign if you can


return charging cables and connectors neatly to minimise the danger to other people and avoid creating an obstacle for other road users






Read the updated rule




Rule 239 (Waiting and parking)

The 
Civil Partnership Act 2004
 enabled same-sex couples for the first time in UK history to  have their relationship recognised in law. It also gives them equivalent rights and responsibilities as to marriage.


Last week
 the Government published the results of its equal marriage consultation, and announced that it would introduce legislation next year which allow same-sex marriage.


We will also introduce a process that will allow civil partnerships (now numbering some 50,000) to be converted into a civil marriage; and change the law so that individuals can legally change their gender while remaining married - putting an end to the distressing process of having to end a marriage or civil partnership before a full gender recognition certificate can be issued. 


Equality for all


“The Civil Partnership Act 2004 marked a significant milestone in UK history and I am proud to be celebrating the 7th anniversary of its implementation,” said Women and Equalities Minister Jo Swinson. “It’s great that around 50,000 couples have already made that commitment.”


“But we also recognise that some people view civil partnerships as different from marriage and feel this is unfair. 


“Our priority is to provide equality for same-sex couples, which is why we are introducing legislation next year to ensure that same-sex couples can marry. And those couples who are already in a civil partnership will be able to convert to a marriage if they so wish.”

A swathe of red tape holding up the delivery of broadband infrastructure is to be swept away, clearing the way for the UK to have the fastest broadband of any major European country.


“Superfast broadband is vital to secure our country’s future - to kick start economic growth and create jobs,” said 
Maria Miller
. “We are putting in the essential infrastructure that will make UK businesses competitive, and sweeping away the red tape that is a barrier to economic recovery.


“The Government means business and we are determined to cut through the bureaucracy that is holding us back.”


Prime Minister David Cameron said superfast broadband is “an essential building block of a growing economy, so we are cutting the red tape”.


Under the 
new plans
:






Broadband street cabinets and other infrastructure can be installed without the need for prior approval from the local council (except in Sites of Special Scientific Interest)






Broadband companies will face less cost and bureaucracy in laying cables in streets






Broadband cables and cabinets can be installed on or under private land without the bureaucratic burden of long-running negotiations






Government is investing £680 million to ensure the UK has the best superfast broadband in Europe by 2015 and will also work with mobile operators, local government and other interested parties to consider ways that the planning process might be streamlined to speed up the deployment of mobile infrastructure.

newly equipped music rehearsal space
, formally opened today by Creative Industries Minister Ed Vaizey and Chief Executive of UK Music Feargal Sharkey.


“This new rehearsal space is a great way to bring together young people from across the local community and to inspire and motivate them through music,” said 
Mr Vaizey
. “This is a great example of the 
Big Society 
in action because the young people here are making decisions about what they want in their communities and taking a lead in running their own facility.”


“For such a small investment, the impact is extraordinary,” said 
Feargal Sharkey
. “The spaces may provide a first step for the next global superstar or music entrepreneur. Or they may simply instil a young person with the confidence to think, ‘I can do this,’ and open doors to a career in the creative industries.”


Developing talent


The space will give young people the chance to develop their talents, confidence and skills through a range of music activities including instrumentation, vocal training, lyric writing, sound engineering and production, through to live performance.


“We are, tremendously proud to be selected as one of the national Music Rehearsal Space pilots and are grateful for the support given from DCMS, Nottingham City Council, and the music industry,” said CRS Studio Manager, Trevor Rose. “We can now move forward positively to develop the musicality and life chances of Nottingham’s young people for many years to come.”


The music rehearsal space scheme was set up with a £500,000 fund from DCMS and supported by the music industry. The centre, in the St Ann’s area is one of 
14 rehearsal spaces
 that are being opened across the country. Instigated by Feargal Sharkey, the scheme has been supported by 
Music Industries Association 
(MIA) whose members have provided cut price instruments.

John Penrose said: “Protecting lottery funding for these types of projects is an important way of building and maintaining the kind of voluntary and community action that is an integral part of the Big Society. Along with the recent share change it also marks a return to the lottery’s original good causes, ensuring projects that would otherwise not have been possible can go ahead with the help of a lottery grant. The Big Lottery Fund have already done great work in raising the amount of money that goes to this particular sector and I hope that this will now increase even further.”


While it is for Big Lottery Fund, to decide which projects to fund, John Penrose has made clear he sees no reason why the direction should inhibit its ability to fund charities, voluntary groups, social enterprises, voluntary and community organisations working in consortia with local authorities, veterans, parish councils or community projects in schools.  The direction applies to England only and does not apply to the devolved administrations.


Notes to Editors






John Penrose has issued the policy direction under Section 36E of the National Lottery Act 1993, requiring the Big Lottery Fund to take into account the need to ensure that, in England, money is distributed to projects that benefit people and local communities served by the voluntary and community sector.






Issuing the policy direction meets the commitment in the DCMS Structural Reform Plan that the Big Lottery Fund is reformed so that only voluntary and community sector projects are funded.






The policy direction should not impact on existing award holders.






Responses to a public consultation on this matter have been published and can be found on the 
DCMS website

The 
strategy
, which looks to exploit the economic opportunities presented by next year’s Diamond Jubilee and the London Olympics, builds on the marketing plan, launched in January, which aims to generate four million extra overseas visitors over the next four years. The increase in overseas visitors would bring an extra £2 billion worth of visitor spend and help to create 50,000 new jobs across the country over that period, securing tourism’s place as one of Britain’s biggest industries.


Key elements in the policy paper include plans to increase visitor numbers by:




consulting on whether to lengthen the tourism season by moving the first Bank Holiday in May to create either a new St George’s Day holiday in England (St David’s Day in Wales), or a Trafalgar Day bank holiday in the autumn half term


helping to improve staff skills in the sector through extra apprenticeships and courses


making tourist visas simpler, faster and more convenient to get


repairing market failure by modifying the existing, long-established Tourist Boards to become smaller, highly focused, industry-led partnerships between tourism firms and government


broadening our tourism offer by creating alternative destinations which match London, the UK’s biggest and most successful single tourism destination to capture the spare tourism capacity and potential of other parts of Britain as well




The report will also commit to




helping the industry prepare for changes in technology, so tourism information can be provided through i-phone and android apps, making every destination far easier and more accessible for visitors to navigate


creating an industry task force, led by senior industry figures, to cut red tape. They will be asked to identify sector specific rules, regulations, inspections and forms which are holding the industry back so we can cut, modify or abolish as many of them as possible




John Penrose said:


“The UK tourism industry is very big business indeed.  It generates £90 billion for the economy every year, employing 1.36 million people and supporting more than 200,000 businesses, large and small.  So it’s no surprise that the Government sees it as a key element in our plans to grow the economy and get Britain back on its feet.  And by making the most of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee and the Olympics next year, the industry has a fantastic chance to step up a further gear and make an even greater contribution to our national recovery.


“The Prime Minister asked me last year to prepare a report on the industry and to set out positive steps that we could take to promote growth.  This strategy paper is the result - a simple blueprint of practical ideas that show what can be done when government departments and agencies work together towards a common goal.


“The next four years are set to be the most important and successful for this industry in more than a generation.  The challenge is huge, but the rewards for us all could be greater still.”

New clauses will be included in the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (ERR) Bill to:




Allow the creation of a future ‘orphan works’ scheme to open access to valuable material that currently can’t be licensed or used


Put in place a voluntary regime for extending collective licensing to help reduce complexities in the system


Reserve a power to introduce statutory codes of conduct for collecting societies if they fail to operate to minimum standards.




Government also plans to introduce a power to implement a recent EU Directive on the term of protection for sound recordings in a way that keeps the UK’s current strong criminal penalties for copyright infringement.


Business Minister Norman Lamb said:


“It is vital that we make the most of our creative industries, boosting their contribution to the economy while ensuring protection of the rights holders. The copyright licensing system has been behind the times and we need to modernise and make it fit for the 21st century.


“The measures we plan to introduce as soon as possible would make it easier for those seeking access to, and use of, copyrighted works. Freeing up so-called ‘orphan works’ will allow use of works for the first time, making the most of untapped economic and creative potential. Extending licensing arrangements for collective societies, whilst ensuring rights holders are protected, will also help maximise the benefit for the UK’s world-class creative industries.”


Government developed these measures in response to recommendations from the 
Hargreaves review of intellectual property
. The draft clauses will be published shortly, and will be subject to scrutiny as part of the ERR Bill’s progress through Parliament.


Harnessing the value and making the most of the UK’s intellectual property is a vital element of a vibrant and modern economy. The measures outlined today will form an important part of the Government’s growth strategy, the 
Plan for growth
, making sure the UK is one of the best places to start, finance and grow a business.

The risk of poultry exposure to 
HPAI
 H5 in Great Britain is assessed as:




very high (event occurs almost certainly) (with low uncertainty) where there is suboptimal or poor biosecurity


medium (event occurs regularly) (with high uncertainty) where stringent biosecurity is consistently applied at all times

Feeding wild birds


You can feed wild birds but always wash your hands with soap and water afterwards. Avoid areas that have premises where poultry or captive birds are kept. Wild birds can spread bird flu to captive birds.


If you’re in an avian influenza prevention zone (
AIPZ
) you cannot feed wild gamebirds within 500m of a premises with more than 500 poultry or captive birds. Check if you’re in a zone on the 
bird flu zone map
 and find out more in the guidance on 
rules if you keep game birds
.


If you feed wild birds in your garden, read advice from the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) to 
keep feeders and water baths clean
. This will help to stop bird flu and other diseases spreading between different birds.


The UK Health Security Agency has said that the risk to the public from this bird flu strain is very low. It mainly affects birds.

We do this in two ways:




by providing development finance to small and medium house builders


by providing infrastructure funding to support developers, master developers and landowners




Development finance – loans


Through the 
Levelling Up Home Building Fund
, we will continue to provide investment directly to developers, in the form of loans, and to specialist lenders. 


Loans can start from £250,000, with house builders typically borrowing between £2 million and £5 million. Development finance is designed to support small and medium homebuilders that are struggling to access development finance from the private market and to help new entrants into the housing sector, to bolster house building and diversify the market.  


If you’re a small or medium sized house builder and are interested in applying for a development loan, you will need to have majority control of the site you plan to build on and be planning to build five or more homes. 
Read our guidance
 to find out more about whether a development loan through the Levelling Up Home Building Fund could support you, and how to apply. 


Development finance - equity and joint ventures


In addition to providing development loans, Homes England is keen to explore how funding from the Levelling Up Home Building Fund can be used to develop more sophisticated financial arrangements, such as lending alliances with the private sector, increasing the amount of funding we are able to provide to the housebuilding sector.


The fund also has the capacity to form joint ventures, which can support projects to regenerate town centres and revive public places, working with local councils, housing developers and others.


Infrastructure finance 


Through the Home Building Fund we will continue to provide 
infrastructure loans
 to help unlock and accelerate land for housing development. 


Many viable strategic housing sites carry substantial barriers to building homes, despite the clear need for them. These challenges can include substantial up-front infrastructure costs and s106 obligations that need to be spread over multiple phases before the project reaches a positive cashflow position.


Through the Home Building Fund, infrastructure loans will be available to help mitigate these barriers, by providing loans, up to £250 million, to prepare sites for building and fund the implementation of necessary infrastructure.


If you’re working on a housing development and require loan funding for site preparation and the infrastructure needed to enable housing to progress and prepare land for development, the Home Building Fund could help you. To find out more about the eligibility criteria, and how to apply,

Patients taking part in a new clinical study launching today will soon receive different COVID-19 vaccines for their first or second dose.


Backed by £7 million of government funding, the study will be the first in the world to determine the effects of using different vaccines for the first and second dose – for example, using Oxford University/AstraZeneca’s vaccine for the first dose, followed by Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine for the second.


The study, run by the National Immunisation Schedule Evaluation Consortium (
NISEC
) across 8 National Institute for Health Research (
NIHR
) supported sites, will also gather immunological evidence on different intervals between the first and second dose for a mixed-vaccine regimen against control groups when the same vaccine is used for both doses.


A same-dose regimen is currently implemented for the national COVID-19 vaccination programme, and there are no current plans for this to change. Anyone who has received either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccination as part of the UK-wide delivery plan will not be affected by this study. They will receive their second dose from the same source and over the same 12-week interval.


The 13-month study will monitor the impact of the different dosing regimens on patients’ immune responses, which have the potential to be higher or lower than from the same dose regimen. Initial findings are expected to be released in the summer. The study has received ethics approval from the Research Ethics Committee, as well as approval from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).


Should the study show promising results, then the government may consider reviewing the vaccine regimen approach if needed, but only if proven to be safe and recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).


Minister for COVID-19 Vaccine Deployment, Nadhim Zahawi, said:




This is a hugely important clinical trial that will provide us with more vital evidence on the safety of these vaccines when used in different ways.


Nothing will be approved for use more widely than the study, or as part of our vaccine deployment programme, until researchers and the regulator are absolutely confident the approach is safe and effective.


This is another great step forwards for British science, expertise and innovation, backed by government funding – and I look forward to seeing what it produces.




Deputy Chief Medical Officer and Senior Responsible Officer for the study, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, said:




Given the inevitable challenges of immunising large numbers of the population against COVID-19 and potential global supply constraints, there are definite advantages to having data that could support a more flexible immunisation programme, if needed.


It is also even possible that by combining vaccines, the immune response could be enhanced giving even higher antibody levels that last longer; unless this is evaluated in a clinical trial we just won’t know.


This study will give us greater insight into how we can use vaccines to stay on top of this nasty disease.




The study will initially have 8 different arms testing 8 different combinations, but more products may be added. The 8 arms include:




2 doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine at 28 days apart


2 doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine at 12 weeks apart – as a control group


2 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine at 28 days apart


2 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine at 12 weeks apart – as a control group


the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine for the first dose, followed by the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for the second, at 28 days apart


the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine for the first dose, followed by the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for the second, at 12 weeks apart


the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for the first dose, followed by the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine for the second, at 28 days apart


the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for the first dose, followed by the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine for the second, at 12 weeks apart




Over 800 patients are expected to take part in the study, referred to as the COVID-19 Heterologous Prime Boost study or ‘Com-Cov’, across 8 different sites across England – including in London, Birmingham and Liverpool.


Patients will be recruited over the course of February via the NHS COVID-19 Vaccine Research Registry, with vaccinations expected to start towards the middle of the month and initial results to be made available over the summer period. The UK public can volunteer to be contacted about taking part in the study and further vaccine studies by 
joining the registry
.


The study has been classified as an Urgent Public Health study by the 
NIHR
 and is being undertaken by 
NISEC
 and the Oxford Vaccine Group, with funding of £7 million from the government through the Vaccines Taskforce.


Chief Investigator Matthew Snape, Associate Professor in Paediatrics and Vaccinology at the University of Oxford, said:




This is a tremendously exciting study that will provide information vital to the roll out of vaccines in the UK and globally. We call on those aged 50 years and above who have not yet received a COVID-19 vaccine to visit our website to find out more about the study and see if there is a study site near them.


If we do show that these vaccines can be used interchangeably in the same schedule this will greatly increase the flexibility of vaccine delivery, and could provide clues as to how to increase the breadth of protection against new virus strains.




National Clinical Lead for the 
NIHR
 COVID Vaccine Research Programme, Professor Andrew Ustianowski, said:




This is another exciting step forward in finding a variety of vaccine options for the UK and globally, for which the 
NIHR
 is integral to ensuring the participant recruitment for this study and the gaining of robust data on safety and effectiveness.  


We need people from all backgrounds to take part in this trial, so that we can ensure we have vaccine options suitable for all. Signing up to volunteer for vaccine studies is quick and easy via the NHS Vaccine Research Registry.




Interim Chair of the government’s Vaccines Taskforce, Clive Dix, said: 




Thanks to funding from the Vaccines Taskforce, this study will give us valuable insight into how vaccines work together and could give us more flexibility as we continue to tackle this virus in the weeks, months and years ahead.


This is yet another example of the UK leading the way in vital research into COVID-19 – and something that people both in this country, and around the world, could benefit from.

The Vaccines Taskforce was set up under the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) in May 2020, to ensure that the UK population has access to clinically effective and safe vaccines as soon as possible, while working with partners to support international access to successful vaccines. This is to place the UK at the forefront of global vaccine research, development, manufacture and distribution.


The Vaccines Taskforce comprises a dedicated team of private sector industry professionals and officials from across government who are working at speed to build a portfolio of promising vaccine candidates that can end the global pandemic.


The Vaccines Taskforce’s approach to securing access to vaccines is through:




procuring the rights to a diverse range of promising vaccine candidates to spread risk and optimise chances for success


providing funding for clinical studies, diagnostic monitoring and regulatory support to rapidly evaluate vaccines for safety and efficacy


providing funding and support for manufacturing scale-up and fill and finish at risk so that the UK has vaccines produced at scale and ready for administration should any of these prove successful




Through the Vaccines Taskforce, the UK has secured early access to 407 million doses of 7 of the most promising vaccines so far. To date, the government has invested over £300 million into manufacturing a successful vaccine. In the Chancellor’s Spending Review, published on 25 November, it was announced that the government has made more than £6 billion available to develop and procure successful vaccines.

It will seek to find out whether schools and colleges have appropriate safeguarding processes in place. It will also consider whether current guidance is understood by schools and colleges, and whether it is sufficient to help them respond effectively to allegations.




Read the 
sexual abuse review: terms of reference
.




We will visit a sample of schools and colleges where cases have been highlighted. As well as talking to school and college leaders, pupils and students, we will look at how well systems of support and response are working, and we’ll discuss the wider issues raised by the evidence.


The review will look at whether schools and colleges need further support in teaching about sex and relationships, and whether current inspection regimes in state and private schools are robust enough around the issue of sexual abuse. It will also consider how well schools and colleges are working with local multi-agency safeguarding partners.


We will work with representatives from social care, police and victim support groups, as well as school and college leaders. The review is aimed to conclude by the end of May 2021.


Amanda Spielman, Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector, said:




Like so many others, I have been deeply troubled by the allegations of sexual abuse posted on the ‘Everyone’s Invited’ website. Many of the testimonies reveal that girls have not felt able to report incidents of sexual abuse to their schools. We hope that by listening to young people’s experiences first-hand, this review will provide much needed insight into what these barriers are and how they can be overcome.


Schools play a vital part in promoting a culture of respect among young people – including between boys and girls. We will consider how schools can support and encourage appropriate behaviour, from the lessons in the classroom to the culture in the corridors. And when children do speak up about their experiences, it’s vital that schools have the support and structures in place to take them seriously and respond appropriately.

189,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/immigration-detention-reform,Immigration detention reform,The Immigration Minister has given an update on the improvements and continuing reforms being made to immigration detention ,news_story,2019-07-23T15:06:18+01:00,Home Office,"The immigration detention estate is around 40% smaller than it was in 2015, the Immigration Minister announced today (Tuesday 23 July).


This is a key aspect of the series of reforms the government is making across the detention system in response to Stephen Shaw’s second review into the welfare of vulnerable people in detention, published a year ago.


The reforms include promoting and encouraging voluntary return and introducing a pilot to support vulnerable women outside detention while their cases are resolved. Practical changes have also been made to Immigration Removal Centres, such as reducing the number of beds and rolling out the use of Skype.


The reforms have meant that there is a higher ratio of staff to detainees in removal centres and there has been a more than 30% reduction in the number of people in detention.


Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said:




I am committed to going further and faster in reforming immigration detention.


Over the past year we have reduced the number of detainees, improved detention decision-making and bolstered the safeguards in place to protect the vulnerable.


We have put in place the foundations that will enable us to continue the changes Stephen Shaw envisaged last year and I will continue to ensure that the health and wellbeing of detainees is the number one priority.


I know there is more to do and I’m committed to making real change so we have detention and removal policies which are fair and humane for everyone.




In addition, we are piloting automatic bail referral of detainees to the First-Tier Tribunal of the Immigration and Asylum Chamber after 2 months in detention. The pilot is due to conclude in August.


We have also increased face-to-face engagement with detainees. There are new engagement teams in the removal centres improving induction and links between detainees and their caseworkers. This also supports the management of detainees’ wellbeing and the identification of any signs of mental or physical deterioration.


Last July, the former Prisons and Probation Ombudsman for England and Wales, Stephen Shaw, published a report which assessed government progress in responding to his 2016 review on the welfare of vulnerable individual in detention.  The Home Secretary welcomed his report and committed to a series of reforms in response.

190,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/inter-subject-comparability-in-gcse-modern-foreign-languages,Inter-subject comparability in GCSE modern foreign languages,A decision to adjust grading standards in GCSE French and German.,news_story,2019-11-05T11:00:04+00:00,Ofqual,"We have investigated the concerns of teachers and other subject experts that fewer students are choosing to study modern foreign language (MFL) GCSEs because they believe it is harder to achieve top grades in these subjects compared to others. We have conducted a thorough 
review of the evidence that GCSE French, German and Spanish are severely graded in comparison to other subjects
. On the balance of the evidence we have gathered, we have judged that there is a sufficiently strong case to make an adjustment to grading standards in French and German, but not Spanish.


Dr Michelle Meadows, Director of Strategy, Risk and Research, said:




Building on our extensive body of work, we have looked at this issue from a wide range of different perspectives. We are satisfied that a sufficiently strong case exists for us to intervene to adjust grading standards in GCSE French and German. We are talking to exam boards about how best to implement this adjustment.




In reaching our decision, we have considered 
extensive research
 including: statistical evidence; contextual data, including the numbers taking the subjects; the quality of students’ work through looking at how GCSE work at particular grades relates to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR); and the judgement of senior examiners responsible for awarding decisions. We have also engaged with a broad range of stakeholders, including academics in higher education, subject experts and teachers to inform our view. We have judged all the evidence against 4 criteria – which consider statistical measures, evidence of a negative impact from the existing position, as well as the potential impact of an adjustment on those who use the qualification and on standards – to reach a balanced decision.


We will now require the exam boards that offer these subjects to make adjustments to align grading standards in French and German with Spanish. Aligning outcomes in this way will make French and German less severely graded in statistical terms. The adjustment may vary in the two subjects and at different grades. We will work closely with exam boards to determine the most appropriate approach, which we will put in place for the 2020 exam series. If necessary, this adjustment may be phased over more than one year.


As we set out in our decisions document, in line with the approach we have taken in similar circumstances on previous occasions, for example when we announced an adjustment to grade standards as a result of the 
impact of native speakers in A level French, German and Spanish in 2017
, we will not require exam boards to retrospectively regrade students that took these subjects in earlier years.


Alongside our work on grading standards, we have also published the 
latest research from our ongoing programme to review the recent qualification reforms
. It indicates that the reformed MFL GCSEs are functioning more effectively than their legacy versions. For example, the marks students achieve are now more balanced across the speaking, listening, writing and reading components, so their grade is now a better reflection of performance across all 4 skills.


Our programme of work has also included workshops with MFL teachers. Teachers have told us that, overall, the new linear structure, with all exams at the end of the course, is better for students’ language development. And they are supportive of the removal of controlled assessment. However, they have shared concerns about some questions being too difficult, particularly in the listening and reading assessments. And they expressed a view, which we also heard in our investigation into inter-subject comparability, that subject content may be a reason why MFL is seen as difficult. We have shared this feedback with the Department for Education.


Timeline of work




In 2015, we undertook a 
research project
 to consider comparability of different GCSEs, AS and A level subjects in England


This work led to a conference, in 2016, to debate the issue further. We published 6 working papers, and further historical material, which examined the issues presented by the concept of inter-subject comparability in greater depth


Following the conference, we conducted a survey of stakeholder views on a range of potential policy approaches to address the issue


In 2017 we decided not to revise grading standards in all GCSEs and A level subjects to achieve greater inter-subject comparability on a statistical basis. However, we undertook to consider grading standards in specific subjects where stakeholders had expressed concern that this decision would potentially lead to students being treated unfairly – namely, in A level sciences and A level and GCSE MFL




We established 4 criteria against which to judge the evidence, to determine whether there was a ‘compelling case’ to adjust established grade standards in a subject. The criteria were:




statistical measures of subject difficulty show evidence of persistent grading severity over several years


persuasive evidence of the potential detrimental impact caused by severe grading on those who use the qualification, and on society at large, over several years


evidence which shows that those who use the qualification and those responsible for maintaining the grading standard judge an adjustment to be acceptable


likely benefit to users of the qualification and society as a whole from a change to grading standards must outweigh any potential negative effects






In November 2018 we announced 
our decision on inter-subject comparability in A level sciences and MFL
. We concluded that there was not a compelling case to adjust grading standards in these subjects, but committed to working with exam boards to ensure they did not become more severely graded in future




In contrast, in our review at GCSE, we judged there to be sufficient evidence, against our criteria, to support an adjustment:




across a range of statistical measures French and German appear to be consistently harder than other GCSE subjects


both subjects have experienced a significant decline in GCSE entries in recent years, and similar falls at A level


the CEFR study showed that students were currently producing work which was of sufficient quality to register against the framework, and that a minor adjustment would be unlikely to threaten this for students achieving grade 
4 and above


on balance, awarders felt that an adjustment in these subjects would be acceptable – a view which was strongly confirmed by most stakeholders


the evidence is less strong in GCSE Spanish which does not appear, statistically, to be severely graded and entries are not declining – two of our criteria to determine a ‘compelling case’ have therefore not been fulfilled

The agreement was signed with US Attorney General William P Barr in Washington DC, where the Home Secretary also met security partners to discuss the 2 countries’ ever deeper co-operation and global leadership on security.


Home Secretary Priti Patel said:




Terrorists and paedophiles continue to exploit the internet to spread their messages of hate, plan attacks on our citizens and target the most vulnerable.


As Home Secretary I am determined to do everything in my power to stop them. This historic agreement will dramatically speed up investigations, allowing our law enforcement agencies to protect the public.


This is just one example of the enduring security partnership we have with the US and I look forward to continuing to work with them and global partners to tackle these heinous crimes.




US Attorney General William P Barr said:




This agreement will enhance the ability of the United States and the United Kingdom to fight serious crime – including terrorism, transnational organised crime, and child exploitation – by allowing more efficient and effective access to data needed for quick-moving investigations.


Only by addressing the problem of timely access to electronic evidence of crime committed in one country that is stored in another, can we hope to keep pace with twenty-first century threats.


This agreement will make the citizens of both countries safer, while at the same time assuring robust protections for privacy and civil liberties.




The current process, which see requests for communications data from law enforcement agencies submitted and approved by central governments via mutual legal assistance (MLA), can often take anywhere from 6 months to 2 years. Once in place, the agreement will see the process reduced to a matter of weeks or even days.


The agreement will each year accelerate dozens of complex investigations into suspected terrorists and paedophiles, such as Matthew Falder who was sentenced in 2018 of 137 offences after an 8-year campaign of online child sexual abuse, blackmail, forced labour and sharing of indecent images. His case highlights the need to speed up these investigations.


The US will have reciprocal access, under a US court order, to data from UK communication service providers. The UK has obtained assurances which are in line with the government’s continued opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances.


Any request for data must be made under an authorisation in accordance with the legislation of the country making the request and will be subject to independent oversight or review by a court, judge, magistrate or other independent authority.


The agreement does not change anything about the way companies can use encryption and does not stop companies from encrypting data.


It gives effect to the Crime (Overseas Production Orders) Act 2019, which received Royal Assent in February this year and was facilitated by the CLOUD Act in America, passed last year.


Open letter to Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg


The Home Secretary has also 
published an open letter to Facebook
, co-signed with US Attorney General William P Barr, Acting US Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan and Australia’s Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton, outlining serious concerns with the company’s plans to implement end-to-end encryption across its messaging services.


Addressed to Facebook’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, the letter calls for a halt to the proposals unless the company can provide assurances that there will be no reduction in Facebook’s ability to keep its users safe and enable law enforcement access to content in exceptional circumstances in order to protect the public.


This issue is not just about one company. However, the letter makes clear particular concerns with Facebook’s plans and the impact they would have on efforts to tackle online child sexual abuse and terrorism.


Facebook’s proposals would put its own vital work keeping people safe at risk. In 2018, Facebook made 16.8 million reports of child sexual exploitation and abuse content to the US National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), 12 million of which it is estimated would be lost if the company pursues its plan to implement end-to-end encryption. The National Crime Agency estimates that these referrals from Facebook have led to more than 2,500 arrests in 2018 and almost 3,000 children safeguarded.


The government is clear in its commitment to the right to privacy and does not, however, believe the requirement to provide exceptional access to data where a warrant is in place, undermines this in any way. Law enforcement and other agencies must, in certain circumstances, be able to access data, with strong and independent authorisation and oversight.


The Home Secretary added:




Tech companies like Facebook have a responsibility to balance privacy with the safety of the public.


So far nothing we have seen from Facebook reassures me that their plans for end-to-end encryption will not act as barrier to the identification and pursuit of criminals operating on their platforms.


Companies cannot operate with impunity where lives and the safety of our children is at stake, and if Mr Zuckerberg really has a credible plan to protect Facebook’s more than 2 billion users it’s time he let us know what it is.

AMR
).


Every signatory has agreed that drug resistant infections must be tackled as a priority. The nations have committed to:




develop surveillance and regulatory systems on the use and sales of antimicrobial medicines for humans and animals


encourage innovative ways to develop new antibiotics, and improve rapid diagnostics


raise awareness among health professionals and the public on how to prevent drug resistant infections




Drug-resistant infections pose the biggest threat to modern medicine. Currently, it is estimated that more than 700,000 people die annually due to drug-resistant infections such as TB, HIV and malaria but, because of the lack of global data, it is thought that the real number is likely to be far more.


By 2050, if left unchecked, drug-resistant infections will kill 10 million people a year and cost the worldwide economy $100 trillion. Chemotherapy would not be possible and even simple surgeries, such as hip operations, could be become life-threatening.


Professor Dame Sally Davies, Chief Medical Officer, said:




This Declaration is the culmination of 6 years of hard work and I am extremely proud that every UN member state is now engaged in the enormous task of tackling the greatest future threat to our civilisation.


Drug-resistant infections are firmly on the global agenda but now the real work begins. We need governments, the pharmaceutical industry, health professionals and the agricultural sector to follow through on their commitments to save modern medicine.




The UN Secretary General will now convene a group including UN agencies to accelerate action and report back in 2 years.


The Declaration builds on the important commitments made by G20 leaders earlier this month to consider how to stimulate research and the development of new antimicrobial products.


Jeremy Hunt, Secretary of State for Health said:




Antimicrobial resistance is perhaps our biggest global health threat – it could nullify the progress of over a century of modern medicine and kill millions.


So I am proud that this country has led the charge and rallied the international action necessary to tackle the problem. We are determined to build on our domestic achievements – thanks to the hard work of NHS staff, hospital acquired infections have been halved, and GPs prescribed 2.7 million fewer items this year compared to last – but we’ll couple that with global leadership as together we face up to a huge challenge.




The UK has been at the forefront of the international campaign leading up to this meeting and to mark this moment yesterday co-hosted a ministerial event with Kenya, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and Japan.


In his global review on 
AMR
, Lord O’Neill called for a $2 billion investment in global innovation funding to tackle 
AMR
 by 2020. At the event, governments from around the world agreed to coordinate their collective 
AMR
 funding for maximum impact. Together. this funding totals more than £600 million, approaching halfway to the final ambition set by Lord O’Neill.


This includes the UK’s £369 million commitment to international 
AMR
 programmes in the last 2 years. Other commitments include £41.6 million international investment by the Joint Programming Initiative on 
AMR
, the GARD initiative based in Geneva, significant global investment from the US through their £189 million CARBX project, and the ‘Roadmap for Antibiotic Discovery’ developed by the Pew Charitable Trusts.


The event brought together international leaders, foreign ministers, finance ministers and the pharmaceutical industry to discuss innovative ways of incentivising the development of lifesaving antimicrobials, preventive treatments such as vaccines, and better diagnostics.


Main announcements from the event include:






12 pharmaceutical companies have signed up to an industry ‘roadmap’ to tackle resistant infections. The roadmap contains a number of commitments including steps to ensure affordable access to high quality antibiotics in low and middle income countries.






to measure their progress and improve industry performance in 
AMR
 the Department for International Development has funded the creation of a new antimicrobial resistance index. This index will monitor and rank the leading pharmaceutical companies using a set of indicators that measure progress against many of the commitments made in the roadmap. The index will be created by the Access to Medicine Foundation and published in January 2018.






the UK’s domestic commitment to further reduce inappropriate prescriptions and the incidence of high risk bacterial infections in hospitals by 50% and cutting the level of antibiotic use in the agricultural sector to 50mg/kg by 2020.

second round of funding opened today for roadside operators to bid for further investment, as government continues to support the haulage sector and grow the economy






Lorry drivers across England will benefit from better roadside facilities, more secure parking and improved rest areas thanks to £8 million in government funding awarded today (11 September 2023).


A total of 39 roadside facility operators across England will each receive a share of £8 million from the Department for Transport (
DfT
) and a further £11 million from industry to significantly upgrade truck stops for lorry drivers.

HGV
 parking and driver welfare grant scheme round 1 winners
.




The improvements will boost welfare facilities like showers, rest areas and restaurants, and increase heavy goods vehicle (
HGV
) parking capacity while improving security for drivers.


The funding comes from the government’s 
HGV
 parking and driver welfare grant scheme
 and forms part of the up to £100 million joint investment between government and industry to support the logistics sector, helping to boost economic growth.


Today also marks the launch of the second window for roadside facility operators 
to bid for further funding
 to continue boosting lorry roadside facilities across England. The window will close on 20 November 2023.


The measure is part of the government’s 
33 actions to address the shortage of 
HGV
 drivers and boost recruitment and retention
.


Roads Minister Richard Holden said:




Day and night, our lorry drivers and hauliers work tirelessly to deliver essential food, goods and medical supplies up and down the country.


As we continue supporting the haulage sector in playing its crucial role in helping to grow the economy, these first winners will help ensure lorry drivers have great facilities where they can safely park, sleep and rest.




The scheme draws on 
The National Survey on Lorry Parking
, which provides important evidence as to what improvements are needed and where to boost the nation’s roadside infrastructure.


With hauliers required to take mandatory breaks and rest periods, building better roadside facilities will improve the quality of 
HGV
 drivers’ rest and recovery, ensuring everyone can feel safe on our roads.


Britain’s roads are already among the safest in the world and the government is committed to helping the sector improve driver welfare, boost drivers’ security and continue to guarantee road safety.


In total, both government and industry will look to spend up to £100 million through to March 2025 to improve lorry roadside facilities for drivers.


Policy director at Logistics 
UK
, Kate Jennings, said:




Today’s announcement will be welcome news for the professional drivers using the 
UK
’s road network, who are often forced to take legally mandated rest breaks in their cabs, without access to hygiene facilities due to a chronic lack of welfare provision on key routes.


This announcement is a positive step forward and our members operating in England will welcome the planned improvements to accessible facilities for them to access during the course of their working days.




The government’s 33 actions to support Britain’s haulage sector include investing £34 million to create up to 11,000 
HGV
 driver training places through skills bootcamps and increasing the number of 
HGV
 driver tests by 90% compared to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels.


Richard Smith, Road Haulage Association Managing Director, said:




We are pleased that the first tranche of grants has been announced and that lorry drivers will soon benefit from the improvements this scheme is helping to fund. 


We would encourage other operators to apply for funding to help them upgrade, too. Better facilities and more safe and secure parking for truckers are a key priority for our industry.




Mike Heaton, Head of Estate Development  Roadside Services from Certas Energy 
UK
, said:




Enhancing driver welfare and ensuring that hauliers have somewhere safe, clean and secure to park their vehicles is a leading priority of our business – and the 
DfT
 funding is a vital step in giving drivers the facilities they deserve.


DfT
 has Certas Energy’s ongoing support on its mission to improve driver facilities.

The statutory instrument to implement this will be laid in Parliament today, Wednesday 12 June. This will amend the Climate Change Act 2008.


Theresa May will also meet young science and engineering students today to discuss the ambitious new target, which is based on advice from independent experts: the Committee on Climate Change.


The UK already leads the world in tackling climate change, and Government commissioned this advice in October having recognised the need to go even further to limit its effects.


In its report, the Committee on Climate Change forecast significant benefits to public health and savings to the NHS from better air quality and less noise pollution, as well as improved biodiversity.


This legislation will mean that the UK is on track to become the first G7 country to legislate for net zero emissions, with other major economies expected to follow suit. But it is imperative that other major economies follow suit. For that reason, the UK will conduct a further assessment within 5 years to confirm that other countries are taking similarly ambitious action, multiplying the effect of the UK’s lead and ensuring that our industries do not face unfair competition.


For the first time, young people will have the chance to shape our future climate policy through the Youth Steering Group. The Group, set up by 
DCMS
 and led by the British Youth Council, will advise Government on priorities for environmental action and give a view on progress to date against existing commitments on climate, waste and recycling, and biodiversity loss. They will start their review in July.


Prime Minister Theresa May said:




As the first country to legislate for long-term climate targets, we can be truly proud of our record in tackling climate change. We have made huge progress in growing our economy and the jobs market while slashing emissions.


Now is the time to go further and faster to safeguard the environment for our children. This country led the world in innovation during the Industrial Revolution, and now we must lead the world to a cleaner, greener form of growth.


Standing by is not an option. Reaching net zero by 2050 is an ambitious target, but it is crucial that we achieve it to ensure we protect our planet for future generations.




Whilst it will be for future governments to determine the precise direction of future climate policy, the Committee on Climate Change acknowledge that we have laid strong foundations through our Clean Growth Strategy and taken action to tackle climate change across key sectors of the economy identified by the report.


Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Greg Clark said:




We want to continue our global leadership and that’s why we are introducing a legally binding net zero target to end the UK’s contribution to global warming entirely by 2050. The report we commissioned from the Committee on Climate Change makes clear that we have laid the foundations to achieve a net zero emissions economy, and that it is necessary and feasible.


Almost 400,000 people are already employed in the low-carbon sector and its supply chains across the country.  Through our modern Industrial Strategy we’re investing in clean growth to ensure we reap the rewards and create two million high quality jobs by 2030.




The UK is already a centre for clean growth and innovation. Low carbon technology and clean energy contribute £44.5 billion to our economy every year. We are ending the sale of new diesel and petrol cars and vans through our world-leading Road to Zero Strategy, and protecting biodiversity and promoting sustainability through our 25 Year Environment Plan.


Businesses, academics and people across society have endorsed the advice from the Committee on Climate Change. Welcoming the announcement, Dame Carolyn Fairbairn DBE, CBI Director-General, said:




UK business stands squarely behind the Government’s commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. This legislation is the right response to the global climate crisis, and firms are ready to play their part in combating it.


Climate leadership can drive UK competitiveness and secure long-term prosperity. This legislation must be followed by a commitment to long-term policies that support decarbonisation across the economy.


Some sectors will need clear pathways to enable investment in low-carbon technologies, and it is vital that there is cross-government coordination on the policies and regulation needed to deliver a clean future.




We will retain the ability to use international carbon credits. Using international credits within an appropriate monitoring, reporting and verification framework is the right thing to do for the planet, allowing the UK to maximise the value of each pound spent on climate change mitigation.


We will continue to work with our international partners to tackle climate change, including through our bid to host COP26.

Advice from independent expert group finds there is no systemic risk of fire in blocks of flats under 18 metres


States that residents need to be reassured on safety and recommends an urgent move to a proportionate approach to low and medium-rise buildings


Following the expert advice, government sets out that EWS1 forms should not be requested for buildings below 18 metres


Major lenders welcome the move, paving the way for EWS1 forms to no longer be needed, which should free leaseholders from cost and delay and provide confidence to the housing market






Leaseholders in blocks of flats with cladding should be supported to buy, sell or re-mortgage their homes after the government agreed with major lenders to pave the way to ending the need for EWS1 forms. It comes following expert advice that the forms should no longer be needed on buildings below 18 metres.


The announcement by Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick today (21 July 2021) follows new advice from fire safety experts that the government commissioned earlier in the year to investigate risk in medium and lower-rise buildings, which makes clear that there is no systemic risk of fire in these blocks of flats.


The report recommends that residents are reassured as to safety, and a more proportionate approach is urgently instituted, requiring action by all market participants.


A group of major high street lenders has committed to review their practices following the new advice; HSBC UK, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group and others have said that the expert report and government statement paves the way for EWS1 forms to no longer be required for buildings below 18 metres and will help further unlock the housing market.


The government welcomes their support but is now calling on others to demonstrate leadership by working rapidly to update guidance and policies in line with the expert advice.


The expert advice was commissioned by the Secretary of State after witnessing what Dame Judith Hackitt, Chair of the Independent Review of Building Regulations and Fire Safety, has described as extreme risk aversion, which has left leaseholders across the country receiving costly bills for remediation that is not necessary.


It states that fire risks should be managed wherever possible through measures such as alarm systems or sprinklers, and that the overwhelming majority of medium and low- rise buildings (those under 18m) with cladding should not require expensive remediation.


The intervention is designed to reduce needless and costly remediation in lower rise buildings and is part of wider efforts to restore balance to the market, helping flat owners to buy, sell or re-mortgage homes.


Risk to life in blocks of flats remains very low. The number of fires in homes in England has been on a general downward trend for many years, reaching an all-time low last year. 91% were in houses, bungalows, converted or low rise flats, while only 9% were in blocks of flats of four storeys or more.


The government is already fully funding the cost of replacing unsafe cladding on all buildings over 18 metres, through the unprecedented £5 billion Building Safety Fund, and has been clear with building owners, lenders and the industry throughout that they must take a proportionate response to fire safety and enable homeowners to get on with their lives.


Today’s announcement – outlined by the Secretary of State during the second reading of the Building Safety Bill – demonstrates that the industry should now be actively taking an evidence-based approach to fire safety.


The move has been backed by the National Fire Chiefs Council and the Institution of Fire Engineers.


Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said:




Today’s announcement is a significant step forward for leaseholders in medium and lower-rise buildings who have faced difficulty in selling, anxiety at the potential cost of remediation and concern at the safety of their homes.


While we are strengthening the overall regulatory system, leaseholders cannot remain stuck in homes they cannot sell because of excessive industry caution, nor should they feel that they are living in homes that are unsafe, when the evidence demonstrates otherwise.


That’s why I commissioned an expert group to further examine the issue, and have already agreed with many major lenders that lower-rise buildings will no longer need an EWS1 form, and the presumption should be that these homes can be bought and sold as normal.


We hope that this intervention will help restore balance to the market and provide reassurance for existing and aspiring homeowners alike. The government has made its position very clear and I urge the rest of the market to show leadership and endorse this proportionate, evidence based, safety approach.




There is a longstanding legal duty on the Responsible Person for all purpose-built blocks of flats to have an up-to-date fire risk assessment. Moving forward, where the Responsible Person has identified fire safety issues they should update their fire risk assessments to determine any actions required. This could include measures such as installing sprinklers or alarms and in exceptional cases, remediation to ensure buildings are safe and people feel safe.


To help with this, new guidance for the risk assessment of external wall systems will be introduced. The PAS9980 will ensure that fire risk assessments are consistent, proportionate to risk and actions to manage risk are cost-effective, and the Consolidated Advice Note will be withdrawn.


For buildings under 18m which do require remediation, the government will introduce a financing scheme so that no leaseholder will have to pay more than £50 a month for the cost of replacing unsafe cladding. Further details of this scheme will be set out in due course.


Welcoming the support from the fire safety profession and from major lenders, Dame Judith Hackitt said:




I am pleased to see the support and commitment to returning to an evidence-based proportionate approach to fire and building safety. It’s critical, given the significant - and in many cases unnecessary - impact this is having on people who live in and own homes in blocks of flats.


What’s needed now is for the remaining bodies and lenders to get onboard so we have a collective, fact-based system that is reflective of the reality of the situation and reassures leaseholders that they, their homes and their investments are safe.




CEO of the Institution of Fire Engineers, Steve Hamm, said:




The IFE supports the expert statement issued today. We expect this will lead to a significant reduction in the demand for the EWS1 process from mortgage valuers, particularly for buildings under 18m in height.


Today’s statement will support competent fire engineers to use their professional training, judgement and expertise to assess buildings based on professional appraisal of risk. This should enable a move away from the often risk-averse and overly cautious approach that has been seen in many cases.


We welcome the commitment of all parties to ensure a proportionate and evidence-based approach to fire and building safety for all buildings along with the increased scrutiny to be provided by the new Regulators and the gateway approval process, which we expect will lead to improved levels of safety, providing comfort and reassurance for residents and homeowners as well as the wider market.”




Chair of the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC), Mark Hardingham said:


“We fully support this new advice and welcome the challenge to those who are applying an overly risk-averse approach in many buildings below 18 metres. We expect this will start to redress the balance where disproportionate measures have been put in place to manage fire risks. We want to ensure that buildings are safe and will work closely with fire and rescue services to apply the advice for buildings in their area.”


The government has also set out plans for developers of high-rises in England to contribute to the cost of remediating safety defects in a major step towards ensuring industry contributes to righting the wrongs of the past.


A consultation published today outlines that the levy will be applied when developers seek permission to build certain high-rise residential buildings of 18 metres or more in height.


The money recouped would contribute towards fixing historic fire safety defects, including unsafe cladding, protecting leaseholders and taxpayers from shouldering the burden of remediation costs.


The government is calling for views on the proposed design of the levy, which was first announced earlier this year as part of multi-billion-pound package to fix unsafe cladding on high-rise residential buildings, alongside wider financial and regulatory support.


The government has also confirmed today that the Building Safety Fund will reopen for applications in Autumn for any eligible buildings that missed the original deadline in June, with more details to be published in the coming months.

Very few fires spread from the room where they start. In 2019/20, 7% of fires spread beyond the room of origin in blocks of flats over four storeys, compared with 9% in blocks below four storeys and 14% in houses, bungalows, converted flats and other dwellings.

The government has also today published the 
Building Regulations Advisory Committee working group report
 which sets out the definition of the ‘golden thread’ and how industry can support the government in delivering safer buildings.


As part of the strengthened regulatory system set out in the Building Safety Bill, all high-rise residential buildings will have to have a golden thread of information, which will capture and protect all relevant safety information relating to the building.


The golden thread was a recommendation by Dame Judith Hackitt and will be used by the people responsible for the building to demonstrate its safety to the regulator throughout its life-cycle.


Full statements from lenders:


HSBC UK




We welcome the statement from experts on building safety and note the assessment from the parties to the statement that there is no systemic risk from fire in medium and lower rise blocks of flats. Our expectation is that the existing consolidated advice note will be removed and, with the endorsement from IFE, this means we will no longer require EWS1 forms for buildings below 18m, and consequently RICS guidance will be updated in line with this advice.  We look forward to these changes being reflected in valuations from our RICS qualified partners and remain committed to supporting affected homeowners.




Barclays




We have seen and support the statement from experts on building safety and accept their assessment that there is no systemic risk from fire in medium and lower rise blocks of flats. This should remove the need for EWS1 forms for mortgage applications in any block below 18 metres. Our approach to mortgage lending and valuation has been and will remain proportionate, relying on the normal statutory process for blocks of flats having an up-to-date fire risk assessment to assure residents’ safety.




Lloyds Banking Group




We welcome the government’s statement on fire safety in multi storey apartment blocks and specifically its declaration, based on advice from relevant experts on building safety, that there is no systemic risk from fire in medium and lower rise blocks of flats. In particular, we welcome the government’s pledge to withdraw its consolidated advice note. We look forward to working with RICS as they update their specialist guidance, which should provide the certainty everyone needs. We also look forward to seeing the details of the government loan scheme that will provide residents support if they need any cladding-related remediation. We expect the government’s action will help further unlock the housing market.

National Minimum Wage
 (

) as a worker or as an employer please call

Notes to editors


1.Employers have a duty to be aware of the different legal rates for the 
National Minimum Wage
.


The current National Minimum Wage rates are:




adult rate (21 years and over) - £6.50 per hour


18 to 20-year olds - £5.13 per hour


16 to 17-year olds - £3.79 per hour


apprentice rate - £2.73 per hour




The apprentice rate applies to apprentices aged 16 to 18 years and those aged 19 years and over who are in their first year. All other apprentices are entitled to the National Minimum Wage rate for their age.


2.The government is committed to increasing compliance with minimum wage legislation and effective enforcement of it. Everyone who is entitled to the minimum wage should receive it. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (
BIS
) scheme to name employers who break minimum wage law came into effect on 1 January 2011. The scheme is one of a range of tools at the government’s disposal to tackle this issue. Employers who pay workers less than the minimum wage not only have to pay back arrears of wages at current minimum wage rates but also face financial penalties of up to £20,000. In the most serious cases employers can be prosecuted.


3.From 1 October 2013 the government revised the naming scheme to make it simpler to name and shame employers who break the law. Under this scheme the government will name all employers that have been issued with a Notice of Underpayment (
NoU
) unless employers meet one of the exceptional criteria or have arrears of £100 or less. All 48 cases named today failed to pay the National Minimum Wage and have arrears of over £100.


4.Employers have 28 days to appeal to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (
HMRC
) against the 
NoU
 (this notice sets out the owed wages to be paid by the employer together with the penalty for not complying with minimum wage law). If the employer does not appeal or unsuccessfully appeals against this 
NoU
, 
BIS
 will consider them for naming. The employer then has 14 days to make representations to 
BIS
 outlining whether they meet any of the exceptional criteria:




naming by 
BIS
 carries a risk of personal harm to an individual or their family


there are national security risks associated with naming in this instance


other factors which suggest that it would not be in the public interest to name the employer (employer to provide details)




If 
BIS
 does not receive any representations or the representations received are unsuccessful, the employer will be named via a 
BIS
 press release under this scheme.


5.Further information about the revised 
BIS
 
NMW
 naming scheme can be found at

The zero tariff, zero quota trade deal the UK has struck with the European Union will help unlock investment and protect jobs across the United Kingdom and will allow businesses to benefit from new trade deals with partners all around the world.


However, there are a range of actions businesses must take in order to take advantage of these opportunities outside the customs union and single market. Today (18 January 2021) Minister Scully is urging businesses who have not yet taken steps to prepare for the UK’s new start to act now to avoid any potential disruption to their operations.


Business Minister Paul Scully said:




The UK is finally out of the EU single market and customs union, and business is changing.


Many businesses have made great strides to get ready for the UK’s new start, but we know some are further behind. To avoid any potential disruption to your business, you must not delay - make your final preparations now.


The government will be here to help businesses navigate this change. You can use this checklist, watch our on demand videos, or visit gov.uk/transition to get personalised advice.




The 6 key actions many firms may need to take are:






Goods - if you import or export goods to the EU, you must get an 
EORI
 number
, make customs declarations or employ an agent to do them for you, check if your goods require extra papers (like plant or animal products) and speak to the EU business you’re trading with to make sure they’re completing the right EU paperwork. There are also special rules that apply to Northern Ireland. Hauliers must obtain a 
Kent Access Permit
 and have a negative COVID test before they head to port in Kent






Services - if you deliver services to the EU, you must check whether your 
professional qualification
 is recognised by the appropriate EU regulator






People - if you need to hire skilled staff from the EU, you must apply to become a 
licensed sponsor






Travel - if you need to travel to the EU for business, you must check whether you need a 
visa or work permit






Data - if your goods are protected by 
Intellectual Property (
IP
)
, you will need to check the new rules for parallel exporting 
IP
 protected goods from the UK to the EU, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. You risk infringing on 
IP
 rights if you do not follow the new rules






Accounting and reporting - if your business has a presence in the EU you may need to change how you undertake 
accounting and reporting
 to ensure compliance with the relevant requirements






These 6 key actions should act as a guide for every business affected by the new rules, with more detailed, personalised advice available through the checker tool on 
gov.uk/transition
.


To further support firms, the Business Department has launched a series of new, 
on demand videos
 to help businesses familiarise themselves with the new rules. Topics include importing and exporting, trade, data, and audit and accounting.


Businesses can select which videos to view from the list, or can choose their sector and see videos that are recommended for them.


Many actions related to EU exit needed to have been taken regardless of the outcome of negotiations, and are therefore unaffected by the trade deal the UK has negotiated with the EU. However, in some areas, such as tariffs and audit and accounting, there is new guidance that businesses will need to familiarise themselves with.


The Business Support Helpline (0800 098 1098) is a free service operating across England. It can provide information on a wide range of business issues, including starting up, business continuity, growth and access to finance, including the range of business support available from government. Similar services are available in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

199,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/help-for-small-businesses-to-stamp-out-fraud,Help for small businesses to stamp out fraud,New research helping small businesses protect themselves against fraudsters has been published today.,press_release,2012-09-18T01:00:00+01:00,Home Office,"The new in-depth study, carried out by the national fraud authority (NFA) and the department for business, innovation and skills (BIS), categorises small businesses by their vulnerability to fraud to determine how and why they become victims.


The research, which found a quarter of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) surveyed had suffered at least one type of fraud or internet crime in the past year, will help develop targeted fraud prevention strategies to help businesses protect themselves and their profits and to trade online confidently.


This research builds on work led by the NFA to introduce stronger anti-fraud controls to business and disrupt and punish fraudsters.


Conducted as part of the national cyber security programme, the research recognises the importance of SMEs to the UK economy, and shows business that knowing how to use new technology and the internet securely can help protect their revenues and drive growth.


Home office minister for crime prevention Jeremy Browne said:


‘For too long online fraud has been seen as a victimless crime or simply a cost of doing business in an internet age, but left unchecked it can cost people their livelihoods.


‘That is why we are determined to combat the fraudsters and scammers who damage British businesses and prey on vulnerable customers, pushing up costs for us all.


‘Part of the solution lies in understanding the extent and nature of the problem and that’s why this research is so valuable in helping the NFA help business strengthen their response to fraud and stop them becoming victims.’


The NFA is a home office agency which works with the counter-fraud community to make fraud more difficult to commit in and against the UK.

Working with SMEs is just one part of a range of ongoing awareness and prevention activities aimed at multiple sectors under fighting fraud together - the national plan to reduce and combat fraud in the UK.


This latest research showed that almost two-thirds (63 per cent) of SMEs that had experienced fraud were concerned about becoming a victim again, but many may also be underestimating the threat with one in 10 failing to take any action after suffering an incident. Other findings include:




experience of fraud being 11 per cent higher for those trading online;


computer hacking being the most common crime type, with 23 per cent of SMEs responding that they had experienced it at some point in their trading history, followed by card not present fraud (19 per cent) and employee fraud (18 per cent);


hacking also caused the greatest concern, with 55 per cent of small businesses either very or quite concerned about it. This was followed by corporate identity fraud (43 per cent);


awareness alone does not provide enough protection for SMEs, as the majority of victims (55 per cent) were aware of the fraud type before they suffered it;


around 12 per cent of victims reported losing more than 1 per cent of their turnover;


after suffering fraud, only just over half (53 per cent) reported it.




The NFA and BIS have used the findings of this research to identify six distinct SME segments defined by factors such as awareness of different fraud types, perception of and actual risk, business size and use of online trading. The national small business fraud segmentation will help determine exactly how attitudes, behaviour and other business characteristics contribute to fraud and internet crime risk.


This segmentation will be used to develop activities targeting vulnerable small businesses to increase their capability to prevent fraud and enable them to fully exploit new technology to expand their business.


David Willetts, minister for universities and science, said:


‘Small and medium sized businesses are vital to the UK economy and we want to help them exploit new opportunities. That is why they are an important part of the government’s national cyber security strategy.


‘This research means we can target support at SMEs so they can fully reap the benefits of technology whilst minimising the threats, helping them grow faster and perform better.’


There is already significant support available to small businesses suffering fraud or online crime. For those who want to use the internet confidently, safely and securely the NFA runs Action Fraud, a national service for individuals and businesses to report fraud and internet crime and obtain advice on how best to protect themselves.


Get safe online is a joint initiative between the government, law enforcement and leading businesses, which provides computer users and small businesses with free, independent advice on using the internet safely.

Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary
 (HMIC) found that police authorities and forces have made a good start in developing plans for the next four years.


You can read the findings on the HMIC website.


Resources not numbers


‘Every force should be driving through efficiencies, rooting out wasteful spending and cutting crime,’ said Mr Brokenshire


‘The effectiveness of a police force depends not on its total numbers, but on how well it uses its resources.’


Reduced costs


The minister said that there is evidence that police are succeeding in ‘reducing costs while protecting frontline services,’ pointing to HMIC predictions that by March 2012 the proportion of police working in frontline roles will be higher than in March 2010.


He added that central government is helping to reduce bureaucratic burdens on forces: ‘We are playing our part by getting rid of needless bureaucracy, cutting out wasted time and money in IT and making sure police forces make the most of their vast purchasing power by buying together.


‘Changes such as streamlining the crime recording processes and returning charging discretion to officers could save well over 2.5 million hours of police time each year.’

Within days the National Identity Register - which was designed to hold the details of card holders - will be destroyed.


Laid to rest


Immigration minister Damian Green said: ‘Laying ID cards to rest demonstrates the government’s commitment to scale back the power of the state and restore civil liberties.


‘It is about the people having trust in the government to know when it is necessary and appropriate for the state to hold and use personal data, and it is about the government placing their trust in the common-sense and responsible attitude of the people.’


Change in law


Card holders will no longer be able to use the cards to prove their identity or as a travel document in Europe.


The 
Identity and Passport Service (IPS)
 has written to all existing cardholders and informed international border agencies, travel operators and customers of the change in law.

Each had two pieces of ‘carry-on’ luggage. These were searched by Border Force officers who found the drugs inside their bags, wrapped in silver foil.


Wholesale value of £4 million


They were each carrying between 19 and 27 kilos of cocaine. The total weight of the haul was 86 kilos. It had a wholesale value of more than £4million, but if cut and sold on the street it could’ve had a value in excess of double that.


The case was referred to the Serious Organised Crime Agency who took up the investigation.


The four were later charged with importing a class A drug, and pleaded guilty. They were sentenced at Croydon Crown Court on Thursday 17 May.


On constant alert


Carole Upshall, Border Force director for the South of England, said: ‘This was one of the biggest seizures of its kind that we have ever had at Gatwick, and the sentences handed down today reflect that.


‘Our officers are on constant alert to keep class A drugs and other banned substances out of the UK.


‘Working together with the Serious Organised Crime Agency and other law enforcement colleagues we are determined to stop them reaching our streets and our communities.’

If the phone is blocked, recyclers will refuse to buy it and details of the phone and the person or organisation who offered it to them will be passed on to police.


Why is it a problem?


Although 90 per cent of handsets reported stolen in the UK are blocked across all networks within 48 hours of being reported, they can still be used overseas. The mobile phone recycling industry exports many of the handsets it buys and this has created a new market for stolen phones.


The regulation will stop an estimated 100,000 phones from being sold to recycling companies every year.


Industry endorsement


In return, the companies that sign up to the code will be placed on an approved list of recyclers, which consumers will have access to, and which the mobile phone industry will recommend people buy from.


Closing the loophole


Crime prevention minister James Brokenshire said that the code would close ‘a multi-million pound loophole that has been exploited by criminals.’


He said, ‘Tackling crime effectively is not just a job for government alone, action at all levels of society is needed to make a real difference. This new agreement is a perfect example of what this approach can achieve.


‘By joining forces with the police, the mobile phone industry is closing a multi-million pound loophole that has been exploited by criminals and the industry should be congratulated. Alongside the impressive work on blocking stolen phones, this code will make mobile phone theft an even less profitable crime.’

Minister for Equalities Lynne Featherstone said:


‘I am delighted to confirm that early next year, this government will begin a formal consultation on equal civil marriage for same-sex couples.


‘This would allow us to make any legislative changes before the end of this Parliament.


‘We will be working closely with all those who have an interest in the area to understand their views ahead of the formal consultation.’


The consultation will only cover civil marriage for same sex couples – not religious marriage.


Notes to editors






Currently, civil marriages are only open to opposite sex couples and civil partnerships are only open to same sex couples.






The consultation will look at civil marriage of same sex couples but it will not include consultation on civil partnerships for opposite sex couples.






Earlier this year, the government announced that religious buildings will be allowed to host civil partnership registrations. The change, which will be entirely voluntary and will not force any religious group to host civil partnership registrations if they do not wish to do so, is being introduced as part of the Equality Act 2010. It will give same-sex couples, who are currently prevented from registering their civil partnership in a religious setting, the chance to do so.






The government will be laying the necessary regulations by the end of this year in order to allow the first civil partnership on religious premises to take place as soon as possible in the new year. This is a separate piece of work to the consultation being announced today.

A copy of the 
statement
 is available to download.


The key announcements are:


Schools Capital




The Government will provide £500 million to help local authorities provide extra school places - meeting the extra pressures caused by increased birth rates.


A new school rebuilding programme has been launched. It will be targeted at those schools in the worst condition. Information will be available shortly from 
Partnerships for Schools
.


School Building regulations will be pared down significantly - cutting red tape and costs.


The Government is minded not to fund the BSF projects which were the subject of a judicial review earlier this year, subject to further representations from the authorities involved.


The recommendations of Sebastian James’s review on school building will be broadly accepted subject to a thorough consultation process on details and implementation. This consultation is being launched today and is available from the publications section. We will carry out a condition survey of all school buildings so that funding can be better targeted. We will revise school building regulations to reduce unnecessary burdens and bureaucracy. We will also improve the design of schools to achieve better buildings and better value.




Schools Funding




A new consultation (available from the publications section) has been launched seeking views on proposals for a new, fairer and more transparent school funding system.


The current funding system for maintained schools will continue in 2012-13.


A consultation has been launched with Local Authorities only about LACSEG academy funding, to ensure that the rapid growth in academy numbers is funded fairly and to ensure that local authorities are not double funded for services they no longer provide.  This consultation is available from the publications section




The Secretary of State has written to local authorities, schools and other partners setting out the full details of these announcements. The letter is available below.


Letter from the Secretary of State


Dear Colleague,


Today I am making a series of announcements on education funding with the aim of making the system fairer and less bureaucratic. These announcements cover both capital investment and school revenue funding. The key elements are outlined below.


Capital investment


I am announcing my initial response to Sebastian James’s review of education capital funding. I accept the majority of the review recommendations, subject to consultation.


This consultation will run for twelve weeks and will focus on two key areas. First, the best model for allocating and prioritising capital, recognising the increasing diversity of the schools estate; and secondly the proposals put forward on procurement and project management, calling for a more centralised approach to capture efficiencies and build expertise.


While there are undoubted benefits to implementing these proposals, I would like to hear views from all interested parties.


I am also keen to move forward more quickly on some of the other recommendations. I wish to develop a suite of standardised drawings and specifications for school buildings. I intend to collect condition data so that funding can be better targeted. I will also simplify the school premises regulations. I will consult fully on revised regulations in the autumn.


I am also announcing that an extra £500 million of capital funding will be available this financial year for those local authorities where rising pupil numbers is putting severe pressure on school capacity. Details of how allocations will be made will be provided over the summer and finalised in the autumn.


Furthermore, I am pleased to be launching a new privately financed school building programme. This programme will focus on the school buildings in greatest need of repair.


The programme will be available to all publicly funded schools. I am determined that criticisms of the previous model for private financing must be addressed and I will only agree to projects when a series of rigorous value for money tests have been passed.


Local authorities, schools, and organisations with responsibility for schools will be able to submit applications for the programme.


Information and guidance on preparing applications will be available online. Applications can be submitted between 3 and 14 October.


Revenue funding


The Government is also publishing a consultation on school funding reform: Proposals for a fairer system. This follows our earlier consultation in April, on the high level principles of school funding reform. The consultation will run for twelve weeks, closing on Tuesday 11 October.


The proposals in the consultation deal with the historic inequalities which have meant that similar schools in different areas receive very different levels of funding.


The consultation document sets out proposals to reform the system so that it is simpler and more transparent. We propose to introduce a new national formula so that money is allocated more consistently across the country. We also wish to expand the eligibility criteria of the Pupil Premium. The consultation also includes proposals for funding high need pupils and early education.


In order to allow sufficient time for consultation and to ensure that schools and local authorities have sufficient time to plan for possible changes, we are consulting on whether we should implement these reforms from 2013-14 or wait until a later spending period. We will maintain the current funding system for maintained schools for 2012-13. Details of the arrangements for funding academies in 2012/13, following our spring consultation, will be available in due course.


These reforms will bring substantial benefits. However, they will require funding to be moved between schools and areas, and will take time to have effect. We will apply transitional arrangements from the outset to ensure that the reforms are introduced at an appropriate speed that is manageable for schools. These transitional arrangements will limit the year on year change to schools’ budgets so that there is stability in budgets while the reforms are introduced.


Local Authority Central Services Equivalent Grant (LACSEG)


We will also be consulting local authorities, the Local Government Association and London Councils (in a separate, shorter consultation) on the level and basis for the Local Authority Central Services Equivalent Grant transfer in 2011-12 and 2012-13.


16-19 funding


The Department and the YPLA will be carrying out an open consultation on the 16-19 funding formula and methodology in the coming months. Building on the series of expert panels that schools, colleges, independent providers and their representative bodies have taken part in, we plan to launch the formal part of the consultation in the early autumn, subject to cross government clearance.　


This is slightly later than originally planned but will allow us to align with the consultation on the general principles governing study programmes for 16-18 year olds as set out in Professor Wolf’s review of vocational education. The length of the consultation period will not be affected.


I look forward to receiving your views on today’s announcement. The capital and revenue consultations can be downloaded from the 
consultations section
 of the website.


The 
LACSEG consultation
 is available to download.

The Home Secretary’s statement to Parliament


Theresa May said, ‘our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of those who were so senselessly killed and injured in the shootings’.


Read the Home Secretary’s full statement.


She said that 12 people were killed in the attack, as well as the alleged gunman, Derrick Bird. She said that 11 people who were injured have been, or are being treated in hospitals in the area.


She said police are working to confirm the identities of those who died. Names will be released by Cumbria Constabulary as each formal identification is confirmed and after families are officially notified.


Family liaison officers worked through the night to help identify the dead and contact relatives.


Police fired no shots


She confirmed that throughout the incident police officers fired no shots, and that police believe Bird took his own life. She said police are processing 30 separate crime scenes, with more than 100 detectives working on the case.


‘The investigation will look into Derrick Bird’s history, his access to firearms, and the motivations for his actions,’ she said.


Bird was a licensed firearms holder


She also confirmed that Derrick Bird was a licensed firearms holder.


‘He held a shotgun license since 1995, and a firearms licence (for the .22 rifle) since 2007. I can now tell the House that the police have confirmed to me that his licences covered the firearms seized yesterday.’


We will remember the lives that were lost


She called for the police to be given time to conduct their investigation.


‘Where there are lessons to be learned, we will learn them.  Where there are changes to be made, we will make them,’ she said. ‘But for now, let us wish the injured victims a speedy recovery, remember the 12 innocent lives that were taken, and pray for the families and friends they leave behind.’

The key to the new measures, introduced by Business Secretary Vince Cable, will be the principle of copying out the text of European directives directly into UK law.


This direct ‘copy out’ principle will mean that the way European law is interpreted does not unfairly restrict British companies.The key elements of the principles are:




Work on the implementation of an EU directive should start immediately after agreement is reached in Brussels. By starting implementation work early, businesses will have more chance to influence the approach, ensuring greater certainty and early warning about its impact.


Early transposition of EU regulations will be avoided except where there are compelling reasons to do so. British businesses will then not be at a disadvantage to their European competitors.


European directives will normally be directly copied into UK legislation, except where it would adversely affect UK interests, such as putting UK businesses at a competitive disadvantage.


Ministers will conduct a review of European legislation every five years. The review process would involve a consultation with businesses and provide a unique opportunity to improve how European legislation is implemented, to ensure that it poses as small a burden as possible on business.




Business Secretary Vince Cable said:


“I want British business to be a powerhouse for economic growth and among the most competitive in the world. This move will bring an end to the charge of “gold-plating”. The way we implement our EU obligations must foster, not hinder, UK growth by helping British businesses compete with their European neighbours.


“The new principles are a first step towards working with British business and Europe to make sure that we introduce EU rules in a way that will not harm the UK economy. By cutting the red-tape that can reduce competitiveness and making sure that businesses are involved in the process both before, and after through five-yearly reviews, we can get the best deal possible for British companies.”

He went on to talk about the fact that this is a government for the long-term, saying: ’The really positive thing about it is that it wants to be a government for five years. But I think in too much of our policy in recent years we have been too short-termist.

Social and industrial tensions


Ahead of his speech at the Police Superintendents’ Association conference tomorrow, the chief superintendent has warned that a confident police force is needed to tackle social and industrial tensions that could arise in an environment of wider public sector cuts.


Policing and criminal justice minister Nick Herbert said: ‘We are determined to do everything we can to support frontline services.’


‘That means getting the resources to where they are needed and reducing the bureaucracy that stops officers from getting out into the community to do their job.


Size of cuts is speculation


‘At this point, any suggestion about the size of cuts is mere speculation. We will not know how much money will be available for policing until the spending review reports back in October.


‘The government’s first priority is to tackle the deficit and the police must make their share of the savings. We will do everything we can to cut red tape and ensure resources are used more efficiently to protect frontline services.’

The new body will take responsibility for developing professional skills and leadership in the police service.

 

The National Policing Improvement Agency will also be phased out.

 

Some of the NPIA’s critical national services will be moved into the National Crime Agency via the Serious Organised Crime Agency. Responsibility for delivering other national services - like the non-emergency 101 phone number and crime mapping - will move to the Home Office.


Transforming Policing


Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘The government is transforming policing for the modern age with the most radical programme of change for more than 50 years.

 

‘At its core is a new professional body that will develop skills and leadership, enabling the drive to reduce bureaucracy and with greater accountability to the public.’


Chief Constables’ Council


A Chief Constables’ Council will enable senior officers to assess and discuss critical operational issues.

 

The government is also establishing an Information and Communications Technology company, which will be owned by police authorities and subsequently Police and Crime Commissioners, with the police service as its customer.
