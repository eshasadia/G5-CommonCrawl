what is the voa?
the valuation office agency (voa) is an executive agency of hm revenue & customs. our valuation work covers every domestic and commercial property in england and wales, from your favourite restaurant to your local zoo. we undertake valuations for business rates, council tax, and for a range of public sector clients where we specialise in areas such as compulsory purchase, statutory valuations, asset valuations, and acquisition/disposal advice. we’re proud to have helped millions of people to pay the correct property taxes and receive the right financial support. our work is vital to the collection of over £50 billion of revenue which goes back into communities. we also help determine fair rents and housing allowance received.
who would i be working with?
we’re made up of more than 4000 civil servants who are based in over 30 locations throughout england, scotland and wales.
whilst most of our colleagues are surveyors belonging to the government property profession, we also have opportunities for all of the following professions:
analysis
commercial
communications
finance
hr
operational delivery
policy
programme and project management
we welcome colleagues from all backgrounds – you can read more about our commitments on diversity, inclusion and equality below.
what can the voa offer me?
download our benefits booklet (pdf, 5.08 mb, 22 pages) for full details of what is available to you as a voa employee.
the most popular parts of our reward package include:
pay – in the last few years, we have increased both the minimum and maximum pay points for everyone in the voa and implemented a new pay scale specifically for qualified surveyors.
pension – we make contributions to our colleagues’ civil service pension equal to at least 26% of their salary.
working hours and location flexibility – everyone in the voa has the opportunity to hybrid work, and we support a full range of flexible working options including part time, part year, compressed hours and job shares.
annual leave – 25 days of annual leave, rising to 30 days after five years
family friendly policies – a comprehensive family support package including 26 weeks maternity leave, four weeks of paid paternity leave, shared parental or adoption leave up to 26 weeks’ full pay, 13 weeks of statutory pay and another 13 weeks unpaid, as well as support with fertility treatment.
learning and professional development – everyone in the voa benefits from a minimum of five days of learning and development a year and access to a large range of opportunities through both the civil service’s learning platform for government or our bespoke learning hub.
personal support – we offer extensive special leave to help balance your life and work commitments, a variety of financial and non-financial benefits (including paying for your professional subscriptions and a cycle to work scheme of up to £4000) and we work with professional providers to provide occupational health and full mental and physical wellbeing services.
is the voa right for you?
values and culture
as part of the civil service, everyone in the voa adheres to the civil service values of honesty, integrity, impartiality, and objectivity. this means that, for example, we do not have political affiliations and deliver the business of the government of the day without bias. we also want our colleagues to speak up safely when they feel it’s right to do so as part of our open and transparent culture.
alongside this, the voa culture is anchored in the value we have in each other. the annual civil service people survey gives us a chance to check in on how everyone in the agency feels about a range of topics. our 2022 results were positive in a challenging environment. most themes had similar scores to 2021 and remained at historically high levels. we achieved our highest participation rate with 82% of colleagues taking part. our engagement index matched the civil service benchmark at 65%. we also got an insight into the culture of our agency, with 86% of participants giving a positive view of inclusion in the agency – 5 percentage points higher than the civil service benchmark and 92% agree with the statement “i am treated with respect by the people i work with” – something we are proud about. we have also put a great emphasis on colleagues’ health & wellbeing, including ensuring they know where to go for their support.
diversity and equality
the voa is a level 3: disability confident leader. this means we have achieved the highest level possible in the disability confident campaign. to be a leader means doing the right thing, setting the right example, and sharing best practice.
the civil service embraces diversity and promotes equal opportunities. as such, we run a disability confident scheme (dcs) for candidates with disabilities who meet the minimum selection criteria.
we value and support all our colleagues. for example, we have strong and pro-active staff networks, and workplace adjustments put in place for those who need them.
we have been recognised as a top 75 employer on social mobility from the social mobility foundation index. in particular, helping colleagues from lower socio-economic backgrounds thrive in the workplace including bespoke mentoring schemes to help people fulfil their potential.
vetting and nationality rules
all our colleagues are security vetted to at least a baseline level. most of our work does not require a higher level, but the variety of work we do means that some colleagues are required to be security vetted to all types of national security vetting checks and clearances.
we can only welcome applications from people who have the right to live and work in the uk, and meet the civil service nationality rules.

you’re probably most familiar with the a-i council tax banding of your house. the valuation we determine ensures your house is in the right band, so you pay the correct amount of tax to your local council.
for businesses this is a bit more complicated. we value everything from your local shop to bigger supermarkets, sports stadiums to zoos, solar and wind farms, 4g transmission towers and everything in between.

what we do
we are the uk’s tax, payments and customs authority, and we have a vital purpose: we collect the money that pays for the uk’s public services and help families and individuals with targeted financial support.
we do this by being impartial and increasingly effective and efficient in our administration. we help the honest majority to get their tax right and make it hard for the dishonest minority to cheat the system.
hmrc is a non-ministerial department, supported by 2 agencies and public bodies.

who we are
we employ around 17,000 staff and operate from locations in england, wales, scotland and northern ireland.
our responsibilities
through the courts and tribunals we give people and businesses access to justice, including:
victims and witnesses of crime
defendants accused of crimes
consumers in debt or with other disputes
people involved in the adoption or protection of children
businesses involved in commercial disputes
individuals asserting their employment rights or challenging the decisions of government bodies
people affected by relationship breakdown
we follow the ministry of justice’s strategic vision for reform, to create a more effective, less costly and more responsive justice system for the public.
we’re responsible for:
providing the supporting administration for a fair, efficient and accessible courts and tribunal system
supporting an independent judiciary in the administration of justice
driving improvements across all aspects of the administration of the courts and tribunals
collaborating effectively with other justice organisations and agencies, including the legal professions, to improve access to justice
working with government departments and agencies to improve the quality and timeliness of their decision-making, which will reduce the number of cases coming before courts and tribunals
we launched our £1bn reform programme in 2016. four years on, and working closely with the wider judiciary, legal professionals and users of our justice system – are making considerable progress towards making that long-term vision a reality.
our reform programme page contains more information and updates from each of the jurisdictional areas.

our energy use
we publish information on how much energy our headquarters uses as part of efforts to make government operations and spending more transparent.

what we are doing in dcms
guidance for our sectors
real-time energy use
we collect information about our energy use from our main utility meters (electricity, gas and water) at the end of each day. the continual capture of data allows us to monitor how much energy and water we are using each day, week, month and year.
to see our real-time energy data, visit our energy monitoring microsite at data.gov.uk.
this data is also available on the dcms page of the carbon culture website.
climate change
the ‘uk climate change projections 2009’ published by defra (department for environment, food and rural affairs) show that we can expect hotter summers, wetter winters and more extreme weather in the future.
climate change has the potential to impact on all areas of dcms business including:
damage to our historical and cultural assets
difficulties in maintaining public parks and sports pitches
flooding of tourist destinations and leisure facilities
however, a changing climate could also provide opportunities, with a greater call for outside events and sports in summer, an increase in tourism, and investment in sustainable architecture.
we, and our sectors, also have a role in mitigating future damage by reducing carbon emissions and contributing to the overall uk and global drive to create a more sustainable future.
what we are doing in dcms
our current priorities are to:
provide our sectors with information, evidence and support about climate change
help raise awareness and generate debate about climate change in our sectors
provide further forums for policy makers and front-line practitioners
develop specific adaptation plans for our sector
guidance for our sectors
the following links provide more specific guidance on topics relevant to the sustainable development of the culture and leisure sectors:
museums: greener museums
arts organisations: arts energy toolkit
music industry: julie’s bicycle

dcms commercial pipeline
terms & conditions
dcms is a very small, policy-orientated department. contracts and purchasing are organised centrally within the department. our arm’s length bodies undertake their own contracts and purchasing activity. the majority of our central support services are outsourced to other government organisations, including our core information technology requirements. we do not keep preferred supplier lists.
the commercial team can be contacted by email: commercial@dcms.gov.uk
public procurement (eu) regulations
as with other government departments and many other public bodies, dcms is obliged to follow the relevant public procurement regulations. the most recent regulations applicable are the public contracts regulations 2015.
these regulations set value thresholds for contracts, above which certain procedures must be applied to the tendering and award of contract. for dcms, these thresholds are presently set at:
goods - £106,047
services - £106,047
works - £4,104,394
the regulations set out rules relating to advertising the requirement by way of a notice in the official journal of the european union (ojeu) including:
the manner in which tenders may be sought
minimum timescales for tendering
the criteria which may and may not be applied to the selection of tenderers, and
the contractor and technical specifications that may be applied
procurement policy
we are fully committed to government policy on procurement as set out in guidance from the cabinet office under the crown commercial services (ccs).
this has 2 basic objectives:
to achieve continuing improvement in value for money based on whole-life cost and quality
to enhance the competitiveness of suppliers through the development of procurement systems and practices
we are also committed to developing the use of e-procurement as a way of improving efficiency.
our procurement strategy
wherever possible and cost effective we make use of central framework arrangements set up by crown commercial service or by other government departments.
where a suitable framework agreement is not available:
multiple quotations are sought for requirements with an estimated value between £5,000 to £10,000 (ex vat)
requirements with an estimated value of more than £10,000 (ex vat) will be advertised via contracts finder, where applicable
requirements with an estimated value of more than £100,000 (ex vat) will be advertised via the official journal of the european union (ojeu), where applicable
all requirements go through the commercial team.
while individual tendering procedures will be tailored to the specific needs of the contract there are some general principles that we seek to apply:
specifications will focus on the required output
all tenderers will have the same chance and be treated fairly and equally
tender documents will be clear and easy to understand
over specification will be avoided
client contractor relationship
in all dealings with dcms, officials will seek to preserve the highest standards of integrity, objectivity, fairness, efficiency and professionalism. in turn, we expect contractors to meet these same standards.
ethics in procurement require high standards of conduct which ensure that the probity of officials and the propriety of their actions is above question. this means that:
all dealings with officials should be fair and even-handed
all of our contracts contain provisions relating to corrupt gifts
sustainable procurement
we are committed to adopting good environmental practice. while always ensuring best value for money, procurement can play a vital role in assisting green policy objectives.
some of the ways in which the department incorporates environmental factors into purchasing decisions are:
wherever possible, when specifying goods, ensuring that less environmentally damaging products are specified. a simple example would be when ordering furniture, any woods used should be from either a recycled wood products or from a sustainably grown sources
calculating the whole life cost of specifying an environmentally friendly product
under ec procurement directives, tenderers will not be excluded from bidding on non-economic grounds. tenderers can be excluded if they fail to meet specific green procurement requirements, but not because of other general environmental considerations.
tenders
evaluation of tenders
if you are tendering for a contract with dcms, you will be informed of the broad evaluation criteria used for assessing bids as part of the tender documentation. bids are usually assessed on the ‘most economically advantageous tender’ which includes both technical / quality and pricing factors.
all tenderers are assessed against the same criteria. this might involve you attending a presentation or interview where you can present your bid in more detail, or we can seek clarification. we award a contract as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.
unsuccessful tenders
within the limits of some commercial confidentiality, the department will always offer unsuccessful tenderers the reasons why their bid failed. such debriefing can be by phone or face to face.
this should be viewed as a 2-way process.
the comments from the department should be viewed as constructive. they are aimed at making unsuccessful tenderers aware of certain weaknesses and strengths and enabling them to better compete for future work.
dcms commercial pipeline
the dcms commercial pipeline can be viewed dcms commercial pipeline published march 2023 (pdf, 250 kb, 5 pages). the pipeline is an indicative 24 month forward look of potential commercial activity to be undertaken by the department but may be subject to change. all enquiries regarding the pipeline information should be sent to commercial@dcms.gov.uk.
terms & conditions
dcms use a suite of standard terms and conditions proportionate to the requirement, which are issued to potential tenderers as part of the tender documentation.
dcms issue purchase orders (pos) to support all contracts, as part of our purchase to pay (p2p) system.
where purchases are not supported by a specific written contract, the po includes dcms standard terms and conditions (pdf, 166 kb, 2 pages).
for any queries please contact commercial@dcms.gov.uk.

what we’re doing to improve accessibility
smart survey accessibility
this policy explains how accessible the documents hm treasury publishes on gov.uk are. it covers pdfs, spreadsheets, presentations and other types of documents. it does not cover content published on gov.uk as html: the main gov.uk accessibility statement covers that.
using our documents
hmt publishes documents in a range of formats, including html, pdf, excel, ods, csv and powerpoint.
we want as many people as possible to be able to use those documents. for example, when we produce a document we will make sure to:
provide an html option where possible
tag headings and other parts of the document properly, so screen readers can understand the page structure
make sure we add alt text to images and logos
write clear, explanatory titles for any charts, tables and graphs
limit the use of capital letters
clearly define links in text with underline and colour and make sure they describe themselves well
arrange text in single column instead of multiple column, where possible
structure content on pages and in documents, so that it has a logical hierarchy with clear headings and sub-headings
write simply and in plain english
ensure correct colour contrast levels are reached
how accessible our documents are
new documents we publish and documents you need to download or fill in to access one of the services we provide should be fully accessible.
however, we know that some of our older documents (published before 23 september 2018) are not accessible. for example, some of them:
are scans or photocopies and are not marked up in a way that allows screen reader users to understand them
are not tagged up properly - for example, they do not contain proper headings
are not written in plain english
this mostly applies to our pdfs and other documents published before 23 september 2018 and some video content. these types of documents are exempt from the regulations, so we do not currently have any plans to make them accessible. but if you need to access information in one of these document types, you can contact us and ask for an alternative format.
what to do if you cannot use one of our documents
if you need a document we’ve published in a different format:
email public.enquiries@hmtreasury.gov.uk
call 020 7270 5000
or write to: the correspondence and enquiry unit, 1 horse guards road, london sw1a 2hq united kingdom
we’ll consider the request and get back to you in 15 working days.
reporting accessibility problems with one of our documents
we’re always looking to improve the accessibility of our documents. if you find any problems not listed on this page or you think we’re not meeting accessibility requirements, contact: public.enquiries@hmtreasury.gov.uk.
enforcement procedure
the equality and human rights commission (ehrc) is responsible for enforcing the public sector bodies (websites and mobile applications) (no. 2) accessibility regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). if you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the equality advisory and support service (eass).
technical information about the accessibility of our documents
hm treasury is committed to making our documents accessible, in accordance with the public sector bodies (websites and mobile applications) (no. 2) accessibility regulations 2018.
the documents hm treasury publishes are partially compliant with the web content accessibility guidelines version 2.1 aa standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.
non-accessible content
the content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons:
non compliance with the accessibility regulations
some of our pdfs are not accessible as they are not tagged properly and are missing alt text
some of our links are not linked through in the correct way because the url has been pasted after the text
some of our documents are scans. we will update these with accessible documents as soon as possible
some of our documents are excel documents, which are not as accessible as .csv or .ods files
a few of our documents have diagrams. these images do not have a text alternative, so the information in them is not available to people using a screen reader. this does not meet wcag 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).
we plan to add text alternatives for all diagrams going forwards. when we publish new documents we’ll make sure our use of diagrams meet accessibility standards.
disproportionate burden
some of our pdfs are not accessible but would be a disproportionate burden to update, particularly those which are extremely long and used by a low number of people.
accessible versions will be provided if needed and can be requested through the above contact details or the request button on screen.
content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations
many of our older pdfs and word documents do not meet accessibility standards - for example, they may not be structured so they’re accessible to a screen reader. this does not meet wcag 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2.
we plan to either fix these or replace them with accessible html pages.
the accessibility regulations do not require us to fix pdfs or other documents published before 23 september 2018 if they’re not essential to providing our services.
any new pdfs or word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.
how we tested our documents
we last tested a representative sample of our documents in september 2020. the test was carried out by hm treasury.
we tested:
pdfs
htmls
open docs
scans
excel docs
what we’re doing to improve accessibility
we are going to ensure all future documents are published in accessible formats where possible.
we will be adding text to all diagrams, tagging documents properly and making documents which do not represent a disproportionate burden accessible as soon as we can.
we will develop a new word template that will be more accessible than our current template as it will have tagging pre-set throughout the document, alt text pre-populated on logos, and document properties included.
smart survey accessibility
hm treasury uses third-party software, built by smartsurvey, for its online contact form. smartsurvey forms and surveys are partially compliant with the wcag 2.1 level aa standard.
for information on how accessible smartsurvey forms and surveys are, see the smartsurvey accessibility statement.

feedback and research at fco
the fco promotes the united kingdom’s interests overseas, supporting our citizens and businesses around the globe. we offer a wide range of services handling anything from a major crisis evacuation to the issue of emergency travel documents or verification of a document.
we aim to provide a high quality service and are keen to receive feedback, which we use to assess and improve the way our services are provided and work with a small number of partner research agencies to collect feedback about our services.
if you apply for a service online you will be offered an opportunity to provide consent at the time of application. you will be able to make an informed choice about whether or not you wish to share your personal data (name, email, telephone and service you received/reason why you contacted us) for the purposes of being contacted for feedback by our partner agency.
if you provide consent to share your data you will not automatically be selected for an interview; our partner agency randomly select customers to participate.
your data will continue to remain protected at all times and processed in accordance with the applicable data protection legislation including the general data protection regulation (gdpr) and the data protection act (dpa).
if you are not an online customer but instead have sought consular assistance overseas and have provided your contact details as part of that service, you may be approached by us to ask you to take part in our feedback programme. we may do this via a number of channels; over the phone, via sms text, email or face to face.
if you provide consent to share your data, you may later withdraw that consent at any stage, including after you have shared feedback. you can withdraw consent by emailing consular.research@fco.gov.uk, stating “withdrawal of consent” in the subject line of the email and providing your full name, email address and the name of the service you received.
please see the research privacy notice for more information.

corporate information
introduction to dbs
the disclosure and barring service (dbs) helps employers make safer recruitment decisions each year by processing and issuing dbs checks for england, wales, the channel islands and the isle of man. dbs also maintains the adults’ and children’s barred lists, and makes considered decisions as to whether an individual should be included on one or both of these lists and barred from engaging in regulated activity.
dbs checks
our disclosure teams carry out dbs checks (previously known as crb, or criminal record checks).
there are four types of dbs check, and each type results in a dbs certificate being issued to an individual. employers can then ask to see the certificate to ensure that they are recruiting suitable people into their organisation.
the four levels of dbs check are:
basic dbs check
standard dbs check
enhanced dbs check
enhanced with barred list(s) dbs check
the information contained on each type of check is different.
basic dbs check
a basic dbs check is for any purpose, including employment. the certificate will contain details of convictions and conditional cautions that are considered to be unspent under the terms of the rehabilitation of offenders act (roa) 1974.
an individual can apply for a basic check directly to dbs through our online application route, or an employer can apply for a basic check on an individual’s behalf, through a responsible organisation, if they have consent.
standard dbs check
a standard dbs check is suitable for certain roles, such as a security guard. the certificate will contain details of both spent and unspent convictions, cautions, reprimands and warnings that are held on the police national computer, which are not subject to filtering.
an individual cannot apply for a standard check by themselves. there must be a recruiting organisation who needs the applicant to get the check. this is then sent to dbs through a registered body.
the service is free for volunteers.
enhanced dbs check
an enhanced dbs check is suitable for people working with children or adults in certain circumstances such as those in receipt of healthcare or personal care. an enhanced dbs check is also suitable for a small number of other roles such as taxi licence applications or people working in the gambling commission.
the certificate will contain the same details as a standard certificate and, if the role is eligible, an employer can request that one or both of the dbs barred lists are checked.
the certificate may also contain non-conviction information supplied by relevant police forces, if it is deemed relevant and ought to be contained in the certificate.
an individual cannot apply for an enhanced dbs check by themselves. there must be a recruiting organisation who needs the applicant to get the check. this is then sent to dbs through a registered body.
the service is free for volunteers.
enhanced with barred lists dbs check
an enhanced with barred lists dbs check is also suitable for people working with children or adults in certain circumstances such as those in receipt of healthcare or personal care.
an enhanced with barred lists certificate will contain the same information as an enhanced dbs certificate, but will also include a check of one or both barred lists.
eligibility
eligibility for standard, enhanced, and enhanced with barred lists dbs checks is prescribed in legislation. recruiters should only request a dbs check on an individual when they are legally allowed to do so – they must be entitled by law to ask an individual to reveal their full criminal history. this is known as asking ‘an exempted question.’
an exempted question applies when the individual will be working in specific occupations, for certain licences and specified positions. these are covered by the rehabilitation of offenders act 1974 (exceptions) order 1975.
the minimum age at which someone can be asked to apply for a criminal record check is 16 years old.
the dbs eligibility tool can be used to determine what type of check a role could be eligible for, as can our eligibility guidance.
barring
an enhanced with barred lists dbs check will include a check of one or both of the barred lists that dbs manages and maintains. if an individual is listed, this will appear on their dbs certificate.
it is our responsibility at dbs to maintain these lists. this area of our work involves making fair, consistent, and thorough decisions that are appropriate to the behaviour that has occurred, and consider the risk of future harm.
people are brought to the attention of our barring team in one of three ways:
automatic barring offence, also known as ‘autobar’
disclosure
referral
automatic, also known as autobar
this is when someone has been newly-convicted or cautioned for a serious offence and they are considered for immediate barring, either with or without the opportunity to make representations. this information comes from the police national computer.
disclosure
this is when someone applies for an enhanced dbs check to work with children or adults in certain circumstances, such as those in receipt of healthcare or personal care, and the check reveals relevant information that results in the individual being considered for inclusion on one or both of the barred lists.
referral
this is when an employer, volunteer manager, or other organisation has concerns that someone has either caused harm or has the potential to cause harm to vulnerable groups and submits a barring referral to dbs.
regulated activity providers (employers or volunteer managers of people working in regulated activity in england, wales, and northern ireland) and personnel suppliers have a legal duty to refer to dbs where certain conditions are met.
referrals can be made online or via post. to submit an online referral, create a dbs online account and once logged in, select ‘submit a referral’. alternatively, you can complete the dbs paper referral form and send to:
disclosure and barring service
po box 3963
royal wootton bassett
sn4 4hh
it is important that anyone referring someone to us provides as much information as possible. more information regarding barring referrals can be found in our barring referrals guidance.
barring representations
where an individual is the subject of any of the above three barring referral types (excluding ‘autobar without representation’), the individual will be given the opportunity to provide ‘representations’ as to why they feel it would be inappropriate or disproportionate for dbs to include them on one or both of the barred lists.
dbs will consider the individual’s representations before making a final barring decision. further information about barring representations can be found in our barring referrals: making representations guidance.
test for regulated activity
dbs can only bar a person from working within regulated activity with children or adults if we believe the person is, has been, or might in the future be, engaged in regulated activity.
the only exception to this is where a person is cautioned or convicted for a relevant (automatic barring) offence and is not eligible to submit representations against their inclusion on a barred list.
where a person is cautioned or convicted of a relevant (automatic barring) offence with the right to make representations, dbs will ask the person to submit their representations and consider these before making a final barring decision.
update service
the update service is an online subscription, for standard, enhanced and enhanced with barred lists dbs checks, that allows applicants to keep their dbs certificates up-to-date and allows employers to view an applicant’s certificate.
the update service cannot currently be used for basic dbs checks.
who we work with
dbs works with a number of different organisations and departments, including but not limited to:
police forces in england, wales, scotland, northern ireland, the channel islands and the isle of man – the police provide information that is held locally, or on the police national computer
acro criminal records office (acro) – manages criminal record information and improves the exchange of criminal records and biometric information
responsible organisations – a responsible organisation is an organisation that is registered with dbs to submit basic dbs checks
registered bodies - a registered body is an organisation that is registered with dbs to submit standard, enhanced, and enhanced with barred lists dbs checks
registered bodies
a registered body is an organisation that is registered with dbs to submit standard, enhanced and enhanced with barred lists dbs checks, and is entitled by law to ask an individual to reveal their full criminal history – also known as asking ‘an exempted question’.

if you want to be notified when an update is made to the dbs gov.uk website, or new content is added, you can subscribe with your email address, here.
bills and legislation
the rehabilitation of offenders act (roa) 1974 sets out in legislation rehabilitation periods, and that individuals do not have to disclose spent convictions unless they are covered in the rehabilitation of offenders act 1975 (exceptions) order 1975
the rehabilitation of offenders act 1975 (exceptions) order 1975 sets out the exceptions for when an individual can be asked about spent convictions – known as asking ‘an exempted question’
the safeguarding vulnerable groups act 2006 sets out the scope of regulated activity and operation of the barring element of dbs, which was previously undertaken by the independent safeguarding authority (isa)
the criminal records bureau, which is now part of dbs, was established under part v of the police act 1997. this was updated as a result of part 5 of the protection of freedoms act 2012.
part 5 of the protection of freedoms act 2012 covers the reduction in scope of the definition of regulated activity, new services provided by dbs, and disregarding convictions and cautions for consensual gay sex.

about us
we supervise the hallmarking activities of the 4 assay offices in the uk to ensure there is adequate provision of hallmarking within the uk.
contents
responsibilities
priorities
who we are
corporate information
responsibilities
we are responsible for:
working with the assay offices and trading standards to ensure that hallmarking law is enforced
creating regulations to help the assay offices (the official uk bodies who test the purity of precious metals) in their work and to help the uk jewellery trade grow
proposing legal changes and advising the secretary of state for business and trade
maintaining the high standards of the uk’s hallmarking facilities
monitoring the work of the uk assay offices and their established sub-offices (including any sub-offices offshore)
priorities
for 2022, our priorities are:
enterprise, promoting hallmarking as the guarantee of the integrity of the precious metals industry
improving the regulation of precious metals marketed online
encouraging risk-based and proportionate enforcement of hallmarking across trading standards
operational integrity
council members and chair, inductions, appraisals and recruitment
governance and administration, review in line with the framework document
read our corporate statement to find out how we are performing against our priorities.
who we are
the council
the assay offices appoint 6 members to the council:
2 from birmingham assay office
1 from edinburgh assay office
2 from london assay office
1 from sheffield assay office
see the membership page for details.
we may co-opt (elect people from outside the assay offices) up to 2 further members. such members are usually recommended by the edinburgh and sheffield assay offices. the assay masters (assay office chief executives) can’t be council members, but they have a right to attend and speak at meetings.
ten council members are appointed by the secretary of state. these members hold office for terms of 3 years.
we are funded entirely by the 4 uk assay offices who split the costs between them.
we normally meet twice a year where we receive a report from each assay office on its activities, and are supplied with statistical information which includes the number of articles assayed.
the assay offices
assay offices test the purity of precious metals, to protect consumers from buying fake items. if an item conforms with the legal requirements for purity, the assay office marks it with the appropriate hallmark. in the uk, a hallmark can only be applied by one of the 4 assay offices.
there are 4 assay offices in the uk:
birmingham assay office
edinburgh assay office
london assay office
sheffield assay office

quality assurance framework
our social research aims to provide high-quality evidence to inform policy development and delivery.
research following children and young people of the 2020s
we’re running a new programme of research to understand the lives of children and young people growing up in the 2020s. the studies will provide vital insights into the wellbeing and education outcomes of children and young people in the key phases of education, from early years to post-16.
the following studies are being conducted on behalf of dfe and are underway.
children of the 2020s - ipsos is conducting the study between 2022 and 2027, following children’s learning and development from age 9 months to 5 years.
five to twelve - the national centre for social research (natcen) is conducting the study from 2023 until 2029, following children and their families from year 1 to year 6. if you have been contacted about participating in the study, send enquiries to fivetotwelve@natcen.ac.uk or freephone 0800 652 4568, monday to friday 9am to 5pm.
areas of research interest
dfe’s areas of research interest sets out the topics we would like to engage external researchers with. we expect to release further areas of research prompted by the challenges posed by coronavirus (covid-19) shortly.
dfe data for research
read our guidance on accessing dfe data extracts from the national pupil database (npd), school workforce, individualised learner record and higher education statistics agency.
research projects
routes to market for social and economic research
all new projects are being procured via 2 crown commercial service dynamic purchasing systems:
low value purchase system - provides public sector buyers with a new route to market for their below threshold common goods and services (under £120,000)
research and insights marketplace - enables central government and the wider public sector to commission social, market and economic research expertise and services
if you want to be invited to tender for research commissioned by dfe, you should register as a supplier on both systems.
registration is free and there is no limit to the number of suppliers who can join.
jaggaer: the dfe e-tendering portal
jaggaer is an e-tendering system used by dfe and its executive agencies. it is a password-protected online service.
as a potential supplier, you should register with jaggaer so that you can:
view opportunities to tender
submit tender responses
for help with registration, use the support links on the jaggaer portal.
publications
use the style guide and template to write your research publications.
you can find our research reports published since may 2010 in gov.uk’s publications section.
research published before may 2010 is available from the uk government web archive.
quality assurance framework
the framework sets out a standardised approach to quality assurance to ensure that analysis is:
fit for purpose
reliable
accurate
transparent
accountable
read the dfe quality assurance framework for analysis (pdf, 688 kb, 49 pages).

about us
as the government’s housing and regeneration agency we believe that affordable, quality homes in well-designed places are key to improving people’s lives. together with our partners, we’re accelerating the pace of house building and regeneration across the country, as we seek to deliver homes and places people are proud to live in – for generations to come.
homes england
we make this happen by using our powers, expertise, land, capital and influence to:
form partnerships that bridge the gap between the public and private sector, in order to deliver new homes and regenerate places that meet local needs and aspirations
champion the creation of sustainable homes, communities and places that are brilliantly designed for the people that live there now, and in the future
support the creation of a more resilient, diverse and innovative housing sector by helping new market entrants and smes (small and medium-sized enterprises) grow, encouraging greater use of modern methods of construction and by promoting the utmost attention to building safety
it’s an ambitious and exciting agenda that can only be achieved through collaboration and commitment. whether you’re a local authority, housebuilder, investor, developer – whatever your role in the built environment, we’re your partner in housing and regeneration, and we’re here to help.

we are committed to our customer charter and providing a professional service to everyone that we deal with. to enable this, we need you to tell us when we get things wrong.
we define complaints as any expression of dissatisfaction about the service provided to you. we will listen to your complaints, treat them seriously and where things go wrong learn from this so that we can continuously improve our service.
you can contact us about any aspect of the service you’ve received from us, including:
mistakes that have been made
unreasonable delays
how you’ve been treated
not being kept informed
we will not investigate complaints:
about government policy or law
that have already been investigated or are currently being investigated by the parliamentary and health service ombudsman
that are, or have been, subject to legal proceedings
how to make a complaint
if you’d like to complain about any aspect of the service you’ve received from us, let the office you have been dealing with know as soon as possible. we’ll do our best to put things right.
you can contact us by email or in writing. when you contact us, please tell us:
your full name and preferred method of contact
which area of the mmo you are complaining about
what happened, when it happened and how it affected you
what you want to happen to put things right
you can send an email to info@marinemanagement.org.uk or in writing to mmo complaints, lancaster house, hampshire court, newcastle upon tyne, ne4 7yh.
the three tiers of our complaints procedure
our complaint procedure contains three stages of escalation.
tier one
this is the first opportunity for mmo to resolve your complaint and most complaints can be resolved at this point. upon receipt, we will contact the relevant team and ask them to deal with your complaint.
where possible, we will attempt to resolve your concerns by phone and will follow up all conversations in writing.
tier two
if you are dissatisfied with the initial response you may request a review by an appropriate senior lead within the relevant team. please explain the full details of why you consider that your complaint has not been addressed at tier one, and we will carry out an investigation into your concerns.
tier three
if after tier two you are not satisfied you can ask any member of parliament to refer complaints about administrative actions by the mmo to the parliamentary ombudsman (also known as the parliamentary commissioner for administration).

if your complaint relates to a breach of environmental law, you can escalate your complaint to the office for environmental protection (oep).
the two most common ways in which a public authority could fail to comply with environmental law are:
failing to take proper account of environmental law when carrying out its activities, for example not carrying out an environmental impact assessment
unlawfully exercising, or failing to exercise, any activities it has to carry out under environmental law, for example not properly regulating environmentally harmful activities it is responsible for licensing

timescales for handling complaints
tier 1 - maximum 20 working days
acknowledgement within 5 working days
full response within 20 working days
tier 2 - maximum 20 working days
acknowledgement within 5 working days
full response within 20 working days
extending the time limits
we aim to complete all complaints within the timescales above; however, if a complaint is very complex it may occasionally be necessary to extend the time limit. if this is the case, we will keep you informed of progress with the investigation, the reasons for the delay, and the new deadline.
unreasonable customer contact
we aim to provide a professional service on every occasion to all our customers. our customer charter sets out our commitment to the level of service we will provide. in return, we expect our customers to behave appropriately and treat our employees with courtesy, consideration, and respect, to allow them to carry out their work.
we recognise that sometimes things can go wrong and might need to be put right. our complaint procedure covers how we handle complaints and where necessary, what actions we take to put things right.
there will also be a small number of cases where we consider a customer, either individually or as part of a group, might be behaving in ways that we consider are inappropriate and unreasonable, despite our efforts to help.
principles and aims
this policy provides clarity for our colleagues and customers what is expected of them, what they can do, who can authorise actions and how to respond to these situations.
it also enables us to deal with unreasonable customer behaviour consistently and professionally, outlining the steps we may take to deal with such behaviours.
what is considered unreasonable behaviour?
it is difficult to produce a comprehensive list of actions we consider to be unreasonable, and cases should always be considered on their own specific merits. however, we would generally categorise unreasonable and unacceptable behaviour under two main headings.
unreasonably persistent or vexatious contact
this consists of contact (written or verbal) which we consider places an unreasonable demand on our colleague’s time.
for example, customers who:
persist in pursuing a matter when they have already exhausted other statutory routes of appeal.
do not clearly identify the precise issues which they wish to be investigated, despite reasonable efforts to help them specify their concerns.
continue to seek to pursue an issue, including complaints, where the concerns identified are not within the remit of the mmo and this has been previously explained.
persist in pursuing a complaint where our complaints procedure has been fully and properly implemented and exhausted
change in the substance of a complaint or continually raise new issues or seek to prolong contact by continually raising further concerns or questions upon receipt of a response.
remain unwilling to accept documented evidence of action despite previous engagement.
remain unwilling to accept that the mmo has reached a final decision on a chosen course of action.
deny receiving an adequate response despite previously issued correspondence specifically answering their questions
focus on trivial matters to an extent which is out of proportion to its significance and continue to focus on this point.
have has an excessive number of contacts with the mmo placing unreasonable demands on our time and resources.
adopting a ‘scatter gun’ approach. this includes pursuing parallel complaints, or other contact, on the same issue with a variety of individuals and/or teams within the mmo.
aggressive or unacceptable behaviour
this consists of behaviour (written or verbal) that might intimidate, bully, harass or offend our employees.
for example:
secretly recording meetings and conversations without advance warning.
making malicious or unjustified allegations about mmo colleagues and/or using abusive, offensive or threatening language.
any comments relating to disability, religion, belief, perceived gender of other protected characteristic.
submitting falsified documents from themselves to assist any case against the mmo.
making threatening contact, either in person, via telephone or email.
any form of physical violence, including threats to carry this out.
any form of derogatory racial, ageist, homophobic and/or sexist remarks.
actions that may be taken
before any action is taken the customer will be provided with a warning and directed to a copy of this policy. this is to provide them with an opportunity to correct their behaviour.
if the unreasonable behaviour continues, action will be taken that is considered to be proportionate to the nature and frequency of the customers contact. this will be set out in writing to the customer and the reasons for any action will be clearly explained.
the following action may be taken, taking the specific behaviour and circumstances into account:
placing limits on the number and duration of contacts with colleagues per week or month.
only addressing correspondence sent by the customer in writing and to info@marinemanagement.org.uk
banning a customer from visiting any mmo office except by appointment.
letting a customer know that the mmo will no longer reply to or acknowledge any further contact from them on a specific topic.
where an ongoing service is being provided to the customer, limiting this to the legal minimum required only.
refusing to register and process any further contact from a customer altogether, including complaints.
taking legal action against a customer where appropriate.
appeal/review
all mmo customers have the right of review, and this will be set out in any decision letter.
request for a review must be made in writing, including by email, within two weeks of the date of notification of the decision made under the policy.
we will respond to all appeals within 20 working days of receipt of the request for a review.
when we will review existing decisions to apply policy
there will be a review of existing decisions to apply the policy every 12 months.
limits will be lifted, and relationships returned to normal, unless there are good grounds to extend them.
we will inform customer of the outcome of the review. if limits are to continue, we must explain the reasons and state when the limits will next be reviewed.
you can access a pdf copy of our unreasonable customer behaviour policy at this link: mmo unreasonable customer behaviour policy - march 2022 (pdf, 703 kb, 4 pages)
complaints against an mmo appointee to an inshore fisheries conservation authority (ifca)
complaints against an mmo appointee should be directed to the chair of the ifca (or mmo representative to the ifca if the complaint is about the chair).
in the first instance, the ifca will deal with any complaint. if the ifca chair decides that the appointee has broken their terms and conditions of appointment the ifca will contact the mmo, who will investigate, and if necessary, terminate the membership of the appointee.
if a complainant does not feel that the ifca has addressed their concerns satisfactorily, they should contact the mmo at ifcas@marinemanagement.org.uk.
any evidence to support the concerns raised should be included. the mmo will then investigate, and if necessary, terminate the membership of the appointee.
complaints against an ifca
we are not responsible for the overall conduct of ifcas. an ifca is a committee of a local authority, or a joint committee of several local authorities. ifcas also report against high level objectives set by the department for environment, food and rural affairs (defra).
complaints against the overall conduct of an ifca should be directed, in the following order, to:
the chair of the ifca
the sponsoring body in the relevant local authority
the local government ombudsman
the complainant should also inform the mmo of any complaint relating to structural or systematic issues with the ifcas, which the communications team will pass on to the ifca sponsorship team in defra.

what we are doing to improve accessibility
this policy explains how accessible the documents the air accidents investigation branch (aaib) publishes on gov.uk are. it primarily concerns pdfs. it does not cover content published on gov.uk as html: the main gov.uk accessibility statement will cover that.
using our documents
aaib publishes documents in a range of formats, predominantly pdfs.
we want as many people as possible to be able to use those documents. for example, when we produce a document we make sure to:
provide an html option or summary where possible
tag headings and other parts of the document properly, so screen readers can understand the page structure
include alt text alongside non-decorative images, so people who cannot see them understand what they are there for
avoid using tables, except when we are presenting data
write in plain english where possible (some technical language is required due to the nature of our investigation reports)
how accessible our documents are
we are working towards making all new documents and those published after 23 september 2018 fully accessible.
many older documents (published before 23 september 2018) are less accessible. for example, some of them:
are photocopies and are not marked up in a way that allows screen reader users to understand them
are not fully tagged - for example, they do not contain proper headings
are not written in plain english, in part due to the nature of the document
this mostly applies to our investigation reports. these types of documents are exempt from the regulations, so we do not currently have any plans to make them accessible.
if you need to access information in one of these document types, you can contact aaib’s publications team and ask for an alternative format.
what to do if you cannot use one of our documents
if you need a document we have published in a different format:
email enquiries@aaib.gov.uk
publications
air accidents investigation branch
farnborough house
berkshire copse road
aldershot, hampshire

gu11 2hh
united kingdom
we will consider the request and get back to you in 7 working days.
reporting accessibility problems with one of our documents
we are always looking to improve the accessibility of our documents. if you find any problems not listed on this page or you think we are not meeting accessibility requirements, contact our publications team.
enforcement procedure
the equality and human rights commission (ehrc) is responsible for enforcing the public sector bodies (websites and mobile applications) (no. 2) accessibility regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). if you are not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the equality advisory and support service (eass).
technical information about the accessibility of our documents
aaib is committed to making our documents accessible, in accordance with the public sector bodies (websites and mobile applications) (no. 2) accessibility regulations 2018.
the documents aaib publishes are not compliant with the web content accessibility guidelines version 2.1 aa standard. the non-accessible sections are listed below.
non accessible content
the content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
non compliance with the accessibility regulations
some of our documents are produced by third parties, particularly those published as annexes to our investigation reports. we are not always able to make these fully compliant, for example adding alternative text to images or diagrams. this does not meet wcag 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).
where possible, we will try to fix these. if you want a particular document in an accessible format email the publication team, and we will see if we can help.
disproportionate burden
there over a thousand historic pdf documents on our website. new publications will be our priority, but we aim to fix any older documents that are relevant and frequently downloaded, as soon as we can.
we do not intend to make every pdf fully accessible. however, if you want a particular document in an accessible format email the publication team, and we will see if we can help.
content that is not within the scope of the accessibility regulations
many of our older pdfs documents do not meet accessibility standards - for example, they may not be structured so they are accessible to a screen reader. this does not meet wcag 2.1 success criterion 2.4.10 (section headings).
the accessibility regulations do not require us to fix pdfs or other documents published before 23 september 2018 if they are not essential to providing our services. for example, we currently do not plan to fix:
publications related to our investigations published before 23 september 2018
any new pdfs or other content we publish will meet accessibility standards where possible.
how we tested our documents
we last tested a sample of our documents on 23 september 2019.
we tested:
a cross section of pdfs
what we are doing to improve accessibility
aaib staff are currently undergoing relevant training and procedures will be put in place to ensure that all new documents we produce are accessible.
we are reviewing content published after 23 september 2018 to make them more accessible to people using screen readers.
we will review content published before 23 september 2018 depending on relevance, frequency of use or if requested to do so.
this page was prepared on 21 september 2019. it was last updated on 24 september 2019.

corporate information
introduction to dbs
the disclosure and barring service (dbs) helps employers make safer recruitment decisions each year by processing and issuing dbs checks for england, wales, the channel islands and the isle of man. dbs also maintains the adults’ and children’s barred lists, and makes considered decisions as to whether an individual should be included on one or both of these lists and barred from engaging in regulated activity.
dbs checks
our disclosure teams carry out dbs checks (previously known as crb, or criminal record checks).
there are four types of dbs check, and each type results in a dbs certificate being issued to an individual. employers can then ask to see the certificate to ensure that they are recruiting suitable people into their organisation.
the four levels of dbs check are:
basic dbs check
standard dbs check
enhanced dbs check
enhanced with barred list(s) dbs check
the information contained on each type of check is different.
basic dbs check
a basic dbs check is for any purpose, including employment. the certificate will contain details of convictions and conditional cautions that are considered to be unspent under the terms of the rehabilitation of offenders act (roa) 1974.
an individual can apply for a basic check directly to dbs through our online application route, or an employer can apply for a basic check on an individual’s behalf, through a responsible organisation, if they have consent.
standard dbs check
a standard dbs check is suitable for certain roles, such as a security guard. the certificate will contain details of both spent and unspent convictions, cautions, reprimands and warnings that are held on the police national computer, which are not subject to filtering.
an individual cannot apply for a standard check by themselves. there must be a recruiting organisation who needs the applicant to get the check. this is then sent to dbs through a registered body.
the service is free for volunteers.
enhanced dbs check
an enhanced dbs check is suitable for people working with children or adults in certain circumstances such as those in receipt of healthcare or personal care. an enhanced dbs check is also suitable for a small number of other roles such as taxi licence applications or people working in the gambling commission.
the certificate will contain the same details as a standard certificate and, if the role is eligible, an employer can request that one or both of the dbs barred lists are checked.
the certificate may also contain non-conviction information supplied by relevant police forces, if it is deemed relevant and ought to be contained in the certificate.
an individual cannot apply for an enhanced dbs check by themselves. there must be a recruiting organisation who needs the applicant to get the check. this is then sent to dbs through a registered body.
the service is free for volunteers.
enhanced with barred lists dbs check
an enhanced with barred lists dbs check is also suitable for people working with children or adults in certain circumstances such as those in receipt of healthcare or personal care.
an enhanced with barred lists certificate will contain the same information as an enhanced dbs certificate, but will also include a check of one or both barred lists.
eligibility
eligibility for standard, enhanced, and enhanced with barred lists dbs checks is prescribed in legislation. recruiters should only request a dbs check on an individual when they are legally allowed to do so – they must be entitled by law to ask an individual to reveal their full criminal history. this is known as asking ‘an exempted question.’
an exempted question applies when the individual will be working in specific occupations, for certain licences and specified positions. these are covered by the rehabilitation of offenders act 1974 (exceptions) order 1975.
the minimum age at which someone can be asked to apply for a criminal record check is 16 years old.
the dbs eligibility tool can be used to determine what type of check a role could be eligible for, as can our eligibility guidance.
barring
an enhanced with barred lists dbs check will include a check of one or both of the barred lists that dbs manages and maintains. if an individual is listed, this will appear on their dbs certificate.
it is our responsibility at dbs to maintain these lists. this area of our work involves making fair, consistent, and thorough decisions that are appropriate to the behaviour that has occurred, and consider the risk of future harm.
people are brought to the attention of our barring team in one of three ways:
automatic barring offence, also known as ‘autobar’
disclosure
referral
automatic, also known as autobar
this is when someone has been newly-convicted or cautioned for a serious offence and they are considered for immediate barring, either with or without the opportunity to make representations. this information comes from the police national computer.
disclosure
this is when someone applies for an enhanced dbs check to work with children or adults in certain circumstances, such as those in receipt of healthcare or personal care, and the check reveals relevant information that results in the individual being considered for inclusion on one or both of the barred lists.
referral
this is when an employer, volunteer manager, or other organisation has concerns that someone has either caused harm or has the potential to cause harm to vulnerable groups and submits a barring referral to dbs.
regulated activity providers (employers or volunteer managers of people working in regulated activity in england, wales, and northern ireland) and personnel suppliers have a legal duty to refer to dbs where certain conditions are met.
referrals can be made online or via post. to submit an online referral, create a dbs online account and once logged in, select ‘submit a referral’. alternatively, you can complete the dbs paper referral form and send to:
disclosure and barring service
po box 3963
royal wootton bassett
sn4 4hh
it is important that anyone referring someone to us provides as much information as possible. more information regarding barring referrals can be found in our barring referrals guidance.
barring representations
where an individual is the subject of any of the above three barring referral types (excluding ‘autobar without representation’), the individual will be given the opportunity to provide ‘representations’ as to why they feel it would be inappropriate or disproportionate for dbs to include them on one or both of the barred lists.
dbs will consider the individual’s representations before making a final barring decision. further information about barring representations can be found in our barring referrals: making representations guidance.
test for regulated activity
dbs can only bar a person from working within regulated activity with children or adults if we believe the person is, has been, or might in the future be, engaged in regulated activity.
the only exception to this is where a person is cautioned or convicted for a relevant (automatic barring) offence and is not eligible to submit representations against their inclusion on a barred list.
where a person is cautioned or convicted of a relevant (automatic barring) offence with the right to make representations, dbs will ask the person to submit their representations and consider these before making a final barring decision.
update service
the update service is an online subscription, for standard, enhanced and enhanced with barred lists dbs checks, that allows applicants to keep their dbs certificates up-to-date and allows employers to view an applicant’s certificate.
the update service cannot currently be used for basic dbs checks.
who we work with
dbs works with a number of different organisations and departments, including but not limited to:
police forces in england, wales, scotland, northern ireland, the channel islands and the isle of man – the police provide information that is held locally, or on the police national computer
acro criminal records office (acro) – manages criminal record information and improves the exchange of criminal records and biometric information
responsible organisations – a responsible organisation is an organisation that is registered with dbs to submit basic dbs checks
registered bodies - a registered body is an organisation that is registered with dbs to submit standard, enhanced, and enhanced with barred lists dbs checks
registered bodies
a registered body is an organisation that is registered with dbs to submit standard, enhanced and enhanced with barred lists dbs checks, and is entitled by law to ask an individual to reveal their full criminal history – also known as asking ‘an exempted question’.
subscribe to dbs updates
if you want to be notified when an update is made to the dbs gov.uk website, or new content is added, you can subscribe with your email address, here.
bills and legislation
the rehabilitation of offenders act (roa) 1974 sets out in legislation rehabilitation periods, and that individuals do not have to disclose spent convictions unless they are covered in the rehabilitation of offenders act 1975 (exceptions) order 1975
the rehabilitation of offenders act 1975 (exceptions) order 1975 sets out the exceptions for when an individual can be asked about spent convictions – known as asking ‘an exempted question’
the safeguarding vulnerable groups act 2006 sets out the scope of regulated activity and operation of the barring element of dbs, which was previously undertaken by the independent safeguarding authority (isa)
the criminal records bureau, which is now part of dbs, was established under part v of the police act 1997. this was updated as a result of part 5 of the protection of freedoms act 2012.
part 5 of the protection of freedoms act 2012 covers the reduction in scope of the definition of regulated activity, new services provided by dbs, and disregarding convictions and cautions for consensual gay sex.

tendering for contracts and transparency
to comply with government regulations we use an approach based on the value of the contract, and whether a public-sector contract already exists that can be used:
we use 3 systems to advertise and to manage our contracts:
framework contracts awarded by crown commercial services or other procurement hubs for utilisation by the wider public sector government procurement service website
new procurement opportunities with a cumulative value of over £10,000 contracts finder website
new higher-value procurement opportunities with a cumulative total over the current eu threshold tender electronic daily website
all public-sector procurements are subject to european commission (ec) treaty principles of non-discrimination, equal treatment and transparency.
nda will publish all contract awards over £20,000 on contracts finder website.
to register and place bids for live procurements please visit the atamis eprocurement system.
general terms and conditions of contract
all suppliers of goods and services to the nda should familiarise themselves with our terms and conditions.

intellectual property policy
for our own nda operations (not tier 1, 2 and 3 contracts), we operate a strict “no purchase order, no pay” policy. you’ll need to reference your purchase order number. your primary procurement contact should be able to supply this if you do not already have it.
revisions to payment terms
nda recognises that prompt payment is a key issue for suppliers, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (smes).
the nda estate sme steering groups raised concerns about certain common commercial issues and barriers. they identified payment terms as one of the issues that needed to be tackled. the issue arises not with the site licence companies (slcs) per se, but further down the supply chain, where there are examples of 90-day or 120-day payment terms being demanded.
such long payment terms are not acceptable. terms such as ‘pay when paid’ are also not acceptable. nda has decided therefore to introduce a mandatory payment flowdown to the slcs’ terms and conditions, applicable to all new sub-contracts and sub-sub contracts through the supply chain, including new call-off from existing frameworks.
site licence company (slc) payment terms are generally nett monthly – the payment flowdown will therefore require that this is the maximum payment term allowable, but does not prevent shorter terms being agreed.

sme action plan
the government has set a target for 33% of central government spend to go to small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) by 2022. we are committed to supporting this target and look to ensure a fair and equal opportunity for all to bid for our contracts.
we also encourage our larger suppliers to consider smes within their sub-contracting opportunities directly and indirectly through the supply chain. all government departments have an sme action plan to support this aspiration. nda has its own action plan: nda sme action plan 2019 to 2022
supply chain charter
the supply chain charter for nuclear decommissioning sites aims to foster good working relations across the nda group’s supply chain.

supply chain event
in conjunction with nda businesses, we host an annual event for suppliers in the nuclear decommissioning supply chain.

international secondments
the fco is the uk government department responsible for protecting and promoting british interests around the world, through the fco in london and our network of over 270 diplomatic posts in 168 countries and territories.
find out more about a career in the fco by visiting our pages on the civil service careers website.
we employ a diverse range of talented people capable of delivering to a high standard, often under pressure and sometimes in difficult places. we want the modern fco to reflect the very best of 21st century britain and encourage applications from all suitably qualified applicants irrespective of background or circumstances. our diversity and equality report 2016 includes data on the equality impact of the foreign office’s employment practices and activities.
in return, we guarantee a fascinating, personally rewarding career at the centre of world events. we regularly score highly in surveys of ‘employers graduates would most like to work for’. the civil service has been in the top 10 of the times top 100 graduate employers over the last decade and moved up to 2nd place in the times top 100 graduate employers 2017 to 2018.
our staff
the fco employs around 13,000 staff around the world. roughly a third is made up of uk-based british civil servants whose careers typically include work in the uk and postings overseas; and around two thirds are employed locally by our british diplomatic missions overseas (such as an embassy, high commission, or consulate). applicants for these roles should be based in that country and usually need to be able to work in the main local language. for information on our local staff vacancies, please visit the web page for the country you are interested in working in.
we aim to recruit a diverse workforce - talented people, capable of delivering to a high standard, often under pressure and sometimes in challenging environments. we also offer maternity, adoption or shared parental leave of up to 26 weeks full pay followed by 13 weeks of statutory pay and a further 13 weeks unpaid, and paternity leave of 2 weeks full pay. to learn more about our work, and what you could do, follow us on twitter, facebook or linkedin. to find jobs at the fco, visit the civil service jobs website.
recruitment
recruitment into the fco’s uk-based workforce is normally either as a generalist into the diplomatic or home civil service cadres where staff rotate between a variety of roles, including overseas, or as a specialist (taking up a specific role requiring specialist skills, such as research analysts, lawyers).
all appointments to the fco are made in strict accordance with the key recruitment principles of the civil service commission.
the civil service-wide recruitment freeze introduced in may 2010 limits new appointments to frontline and business-critical jobs only. this has generally restricted fco generalist recruitment permitted under the freeze to the diplomatic service fast stream. we also participate in a number of other fast stream schemes including:
government economic service fast stream
goverment communication service fast stream
digital data technology service fast stream
finance fast stream
commercial fast stream
human resources fast stream
apprenticeships
in contributing to the government’s goal of 3 million apprenticeships by 2020, the fco is committed to developing our apprenticeship programme. in 2018 to 2019, we have recruited apprentices in business administration, communications, human resources, finance (accountancy) and commercial procurement. we recruit apprentices via our own external recruitment and via the government communication service schemes.
current vacancies
all our vacancies are published on the civil service jobs website and can be found by using the ‘organisation’ search engine on the website. we encourage you to visit this site regularly and set up vacancy alerts so that you do not miss our opportunities.
work experience
the fco aims to recruit a talented and diverse workforce which reflects the society we serve. in order to generate interest in fco careers from a broader applicant base, we offer a range of work experience opportunities each year. we hope that by giving individuals from a range of backgrounds the opportunity to sample working at the fco they may consider the fco as a future employer, as well as gaining beneficial work experience.
undertaking work experience or internship with us does not in any way guarantee future employment with the fco or offer any preferential treatment in the selection processes. our recruitment for permanent employment is merit-based in strict accordance with the key recruitment principles of the civil service commission.
we regret that the graduate internship scheme has been cancelled for 2020, due to the unprecedented impact of coronavirus (covid-19) on our operations. we still expect to launch our 2021 scheme next year in the spring. details will be published on this page nearer the time.
alongside our own graduate internship, we offer placements under schemes run by other government departments such as:
civil service fast stream (for graduates)
summer diversity internship programme (for ethnic minority students, disabled students and those from under-represented socio-economic backgrounds)
the application windows for each of the government schemes vary, so you should check the relevant website for further details.
in order to ensure our opportunities are accessible to all those who are eligible, we do not offer any work experience opportunities to individuals on an ad-hoc basis. we do not have the resources to acknowledge or respond to speculative applications.
our work experience opportunities, which are paid, are mainly focused on attracting individuals from backgrounds that are currently under-represented in our workforce, and on those who bring skills which we require to achieve our objectives. all work experience placements are awarded strictly on merit, after a competitive application process.
you can also follow us on twitter, facebook, linked in or sign up to our rss feeds.
international secondments
the uk supports international efforts to prevent violent conflict, to resolve existing conflicts, and to build peace in post-conflict situations.
in support of this, the fco seconds civilian experts and police (serving and retired officers) to international missions run by the european union (eu), united nations (un) and organisation for security and cooperation in europe (osce).
find out more about international secondments with the fco, for serving and retired police, and civilian experts.

our purpose
defra, in partnership with its arms’ length bodies, publish a broad range of statistics and data on the environment, food, farming and biosecurity and marine. we see our statistics as a valuable public asset. through them we seek to provide a window on the world across the areas covered by defra’s policy and delivery remits and to inform the judgements and decisions made by the public, by organisations and by government.
our portfolio
defra group publish regular and ad hoc statistics which provide accurate and impartial information across four main themes. browse our main portfolios:
environment
food, farming and biosecurity
marine
rural
our latest and upcoming publications
in current circumstances, the release dates of forthcoming defra group statistics publications may need to change, for example where data capture has been impacted by covid-19 restrictions. our aim is to flag any changes to planned publication dates as soon as we can. any decisions to change publications dates will be made in line with guidance from the office for statistics regulation.
for queries about specific planned release dates, please contact the relevant mailboxes.
a separate calendar of release dates across the group for the year ahead, providing a split by month, is available defra statistics release calendar, annual and monthly (ods, 36.9 kb).
our standards
we publish our national and official statistics guided by the uk statistics authority’s code of practice for statistics.
many of these are national statistics, identified by the round ‘tick’ logo with the words, ‘national statistics’, which are subject to assessment by the uk statistics authority. reports of all assessments are published on the authority’s website.
how we meet the standards of the code
the arrangements we have in place to ensure we comply with the code are set out in the documents below:
defra policy statement on revisions and corrections
defra group statistics quality statement
defra group breaches of the code of practice for official statistics
pre-release access to official statistics
we publish details of how we comply with the pre-release access to official statistics order 2008 and a list of the roles of those currently granted pre-release access to our key official statistics.
defra group pre-release access to official statistics compliance statement
list of statistics with pre-release access (ods, 11.7 kb)
developing our portfolios
defra and defra group more broadly has a wide portfolio of statistics and our commitment is to the continued development of that portfolio. informed by the code of practice for statistics, much of our focus is on understanding of external user needs. we are building a range of approaches for this – including direct engagement (e.g. via the @defrastats twitter account) and through enhanced web analytics. we will continue to evolve in response to feedback by looking at accessibility of formats and continue to look for opportunities to increase value. looking further forward, we will continue to assess the opportunities provided by new technologies such as e-dna and earth observation.
within each of our areas of interest, we will look to find the best long term balance between:
overall portfolio summary products such as the compendium of food and farming statistics.
continued production of regular individual official statistical releases on specific topics.
production of simpler more data focused releases (where user insight tells us that the external interest is in the numbers rather than the commentary).
where we see the potential value of new official statistics products or developing existing products, we will look to use the mechanisms in the code of practice for statistics. specifically, we may introduce new experimental statistics, where we decide to develop a new output or modify an existing one. experimental statistics are by definition official statistics and are within the scope of the code of practice. during development, we seek feedback from users on their suitability and quality.
another option open to us is to use the recently introduced voluntary application of the code of practice approach.
across defra group, the following experimental statistics are in development:

research integrity
quality assurance
research and analysis provides evidence for decision-making, ensuring defra’s polices are based on a sound, comprehensive understanding of current evidence. it helps us find new policy solutions and identify and tackle future issues.
we use the term ‘evidence’ to encompass material from a variety of disciplines – science research, statistics, economics, social research or operational research, and geographical information. we use a variety of quality assurance processes.
science advisory council
defra’s science advisory council provides independent advice and challenge to defra’s chief scientific adviser and ministers on the science underpinning defra policies.
science research and analysis
to inform sound policy-making, defra needs access to the right information and needs to be confident of the quality of that information. understanding the knowledge base and using targeted investment to fill critical gaps will help achieve value for money and innovative approaches.
our refreshed defra group research and innovation interests document sets out our high level areas of science, evidence and analysis interest across the defra group.
information about individual projects is available in our science and research projects database
commissioning research and analysis projects
research and analysis projects are commissioned through a competitive process and advertised on our e-tendering site. you can express your interest by registering for an account and logging in.
research project reporting
contractors should use the following forms when reporting to defra on projects:
annual/interim project report form (evid3) - to report on progress in delivering research projects
evidence project final report form (evid4) - to report on final project results and outputs
open access policy for publications
our defra group open access policy for research publications aims to increase access to, sharing and use of findings arising from research funded by the defra group.
statistics
across defra group, our statisticians produce a wide range of official and national statistics providing insight for external users and for policy-makers on state and on change across our environmental, food and farming, rural and marine portfolios. the products are developed in accordance with the principles and guidelines set out in the uk statistics authority’s code of practice for official statistics.
economics
defra economists provide analysis, appraisal and evaluation for all aspects of defra policy, to ensure policy decisions are informed by high quality and robust evidence in order to meet defra’s strategic objectives.
social research
good social science research helps make good government strategy, policy and delivery. social science research informs the development, implementation and evaluation of a wide range of government policies. the best results are often the result of teamwork, with government social research profession members, other analysts and policy or delivery officials working together throughout the development and implementation of an idea to ensure it is as evidence based as possible. engagement as early as possible in this process helps ensure the results of any analytical work are as useful as possible.
operational research
operational research is all about helping people to understand complex problems, achieving the best outcomes and making the best use of public money. it provides flexible techniques that can be applied to a variety of problems, from discussions and logical problem structuring through to analysing statistics and building predictive models. it is especially useful to conduct ‘what if’ analyses, to help policy-makers evaluate different policy options.
geospatial data
geospatial data is any data that is referenced to a specific location, such as a postcode, field parcel or grid reference. types of data include imagery, features, basemaps and tabular data with links to specific locations.
defra makes extensive use of geospatial data to support the development, monitoring and delivery of its policies, as well as underpinning the communication of the impact of those policies to a wide variety of audiences. defra is one of the leading users of geospatial data in government and has been at the forefront of a number of innovative developments using geographic information systems (gis).
defra is the lead department for the implementation of the inspire regulations. if you would like to know more, email geography@defra.gov.uk
defra group has a large number of members of the government geography profession.
research integrity
defra has signed up to the principles of the concordat to support research integrity, which provides a national framework for good research conduct and its governance.
defra publishes an annual compliance statement summarising the processes and measures in place to support research integrity across defra group. this includes the governance, culture, guidance, training, external engagement, and open science principles that underpin the research that is conducted in defra.
quality assurance
defra makes a substantial investment in commissioning, assessing and using evidence to inform policy and it is important to ensure that evidence is fit for purpose.
peer review
defra uses peer review of selected evidence proposals and outputs to help ensure the evidence it funds is good quality and fit-for-purpose.
the joint code of practice for research
the joint code of practice for research (jcopr) sets out standards for the quality of science and the quality of research processes that contractors who carry out research on behalf of defra, and other signatory organisations, must follow.
the joint code of practice for veterinary activities
the joint code of practice for veterinary activities sets out standards for the quality of evidence processes, to help assure the quality of veterinary data across animal health activities.
social research
the government social research (gsr) code sets out 7 principles to guide the work and behaviour of the government social research profession.

the ministry of defence (mod) is a central government department with a mission to protect our country and provide the ultimate guarantee of its security and independence, as well as helping to protect its values and interests abroad.
to do this we must meet a complex range of threats and challenges in a rapidly changing world. we must adapt to stay ahead and shape our capability to address tomorrow’s threats, not yesterday’s. we will build more versatile and agile forces for the future, and ensure our people have what they need to do what we ask of them. we cannot do everything on our own, so we must work effectively with our allies and partners.
we offer a range of careers both in the armed forces, reserves and civilians so however you want to contribute to our mission, either through serving in the british army, royal navy, royal air force or as a civil servant, there will be something to suit you.
join the armed forces
if you are interested in a career in defence, please see the armed forces websites:
royal navy
british army
royal air force
join the reserves

apprenticeships
mod is the largest provider of apprenticeships in the uk. find out about apprenticeships for civil servants and the armed forces.
apprenticeships in the ministry of defence guard service
a wide range of apprenticeships are available to new and existing mgs staff, making them a great option for anyone looking to enhance their knowledge and skills in their current role or to support career progression. apprenticeships are available in many professional areas, including operational delivery, customer service and leadership and management.
the mgs recognise the value of learning in enabling sustainable delivery of its business objectives and have invested in a full time apprenticeship coordinator to provide help and support to the apprentice and line manager.
school leavers and welbeck college
school leavers
whether involved in combat, peacekeeping duties or the provision of humanitarian aid following natural disasters, the armed forces depend on the support and expertise provided by our civilian staff. we would like this to be you.
the mod offers many varied opportunities for school leavers throughout the uk where you can make a real difference to defence. the number of different careers are too many to list in full, but they include personal secretary, pay clerk, commercial officer, project and admin support, finance clerk, commodity manager, course administrator and recruitment and marketing, along with many others.
all these roles are absolutely vital to our mission in defence, giving a unique vision and access to some of the most interesting work in government. perhaps you could be a commercial officer buying vehicles for the army. perhaps you could be a personal secretary to a senior civil servant who decides the latest defence policy. perhaps you could be a commodity manager routeing supplies to a recent disaster area.
but we don’t just focus on your current job, we place an enormous emphasis on your future. every single person in the organisation is given comprehensive training and development, including the opportunity to develop cross disciplines.
as the mod is so large it is entirely possible to change career direction, perhaps even study for professional qualifications, while retaining your status and similar conditions of employment, including your pension and leave allowance. examples would be engineers moving into personnel or accountancy, and administrators becoming graphic designers or logicians.
this is in addition to a number of management development schemes aimed at the full spectrum of the mod workforce, designed to help you fulfil your true potential.
welbeck: the defence sixth form college
welbeck college in leicestershire is an mod sponsored sixth form college that invests in the future of young people who have a strong desire to take up a science or engineering based career in the armed forces or the civil service.
welbeck has provided the army with many of its future technical officers for over 50 years. in 2004 the college became a quad-service institution, admitting students with a career ambition to join the royal navy, the british army, the royal air force or to become mod civil service engineers.
the college has become one of the uk’s top sixth form colleges and has an outstanding academic reputation. it offers a unique programme of personal, physical and intellectual development which provides our students with a rounded education specifically designed to meet the needs of today’s modern technical armed forces.
the programme does not end after a 2 year a-level programme, the mod continues to monitor and support students through university and on to professional training with their respective armed service or within the mod civil service.
graduate recruitment programmes
fast stream
our premiere development scheme for graduates is fast stream, although many graduates also enter through applying for vacancies on civil service jobs.
defence commercial graduate programme
the defence commercial graduate programme recruits graduates for mod purchasing and contract management roles. full details available in the commercial graduate brochure.
desg
the mod also recruits engineering and science graduates into desg via various schemes.
security vetting
we process 3 main types of national security vetting (nsv) checks and clearances.
counter terrorist check (ctc) for people employed in posts with proximity to public figures, access to information or material assessed to be of value to terrorists or unescorted access to establishments assessed to be at risk from terrorist attack. a ctc does not allow a person access to or knowledge of protectively marked assets.
security check (sc) for people employed in posts which have substantial access to secret assets or occasional controlled access to top secret assets.
developed vetting (dv) is needed for people with substantial unsupervised access to top secret assets.
a small number of clearances are granted where the risks are managed through follow up work and monitoring. we call this activity ‘aftercare’. we also process aftercare for all mod clearances that are granted normally.
see united kingdom security vetting: forms and guidance.
diversity and inclusion
the ministry of defence is committed to recruiting and retaining the best possible people from across the country, regardless of background, gender, ethnicity, working pattern, caring responsibilities, sexual orientation or, for civil servants, whether they are disabled.
this is not only morally the right thing to do, but is fundamental to the operational effectiveness of defence.
we are striving to be an employer of choice through recognising, encouraging and celebrating diversity, and ensuring everyone in defence plays their part in promoting an inclusive working environment and respecting and valuing the unique contribution of each individual.
our work to become a more diverse and inclusive organisation is being driven by the defence diversity and inclusion programme which was established in 2013 and covers both civilian and military employees.
as a part of this programme we are working to meet the government’s aspiration for 10% of new recruits into the armed forces to be from bame communities by 2020. additionally we are striving to meet a target of 15% of new recruits into the armed forces to be female by 2020.
while recruitment is an important element of our work, the wider defence diversity and inclusion programme takes a much broader view of diversity and inclusion and is driving real change by embedding diversity and inclusion within our leadership and culture and taking steps to increase the retention and progression of people from under represented groups. this all encompassing approach to diversity and inclusion is essential if the department is to retain the high quality people that we recruit.

all candidates will be treated respectfully, equitably and honestly irrespective of race, ethnic origin, religion or belief, gender, sexual orientation or social background. the armed forces recognise and value individuals from diverse backgrounds who bring with them fresh ideas, knowledge, experience and talent.
family friendly policies in the armed forces
the armed forces offer occupational leave schemes which follow, and in some cases, exceed statutory provision for maternity, paternity and adoption leave.
armed forces occupational maternity scheme
all servicewomen regardless of their length of service are entitled to 52 weeks of maternity leave. eligible servicewomen are also entitled to receive statutory maternity pay. the armed forces occupational maternity scheme (afoms) provides qualifying women (those who have at least a year’s continuous service and who intend to return to work for a minimum of 12 months following maternity leave) with full pay for the first 26 weeks of ordinary maternity leave.
servicewomen who have given birth are screened from deployment in the uk or overseas for at least 6 months after the birth of their child, unless they volunteer otherwise. the services also endeavour not to deploy both serving parents at the same time, where this does not compromise operational capability.
the armed forces occupational paternity leave scheme provides qualifying fathers with 14 days of ordinary paternity leave, instead of the statutory provision of 10 days, with 2 weeks’ full pay rather than the statutory paternity pay rate at the time of the birth of a child or a child’s placement in the case of adoptions. additional paternity leave was introduced for members of the armed forces in 2011 and this enables parents to share responsibility for looking after their children in the case of births and placements for adoption.
the armed forces are exempt from the flexible working provisions of uk employment legislation, as working patterns that might compromise the operational flexibility of the armed forces are incompatible with regular service. arrangements are in place to improve, where possible, the work-life balance of both male and female personnel. these include:
transfer of leave between spouses and civil partners: this allows a service person to donate or receive up to 10 days of annual leave to their civil partner or spouse. this can be useful if one partner has used up much of their leave, or if a partner has more leave than they can carry over into the next year.
call forward of leave: this allows a service person to bring 10 days of leave from the next leave year, and use them in the current leave year. this can be helpful if the service person is aware that they will deploy in the next leave year, and will find themselves unable to use all of that year’s leave entitlement, due to operational commitments.
enhanced leave: this allows service personnel who have served in the armed forces for 15 years or more a once in career opportunity to take 10 weeks (50 working days) off work in a block, by trading in their 30 days leave allowance for that year. this gives personnel the opportunity to take up once in a lifetime opportunities, have that extension built, or simply take a period of much deserved down time.
flexible working: this has always existed within the armed forces, but are being more widely encouraged. there are 3 types of flexible working:
compressed hours: allows service personnel to potentially work slightly longer some days of the week in order to take a shorter day.
working from home: allows service personnel to use existing it to work from home on either a regular or infrequent basis.
variable start and finish times: allows a service person to start and finish at different times during the working week.
further schemes and services available for armed forces personnel and their families, including support through the armed forces covenant on education, employment, housing, finance and accommodation, are available here.
accommodation for those who serve
being a regular member of the armed forces infers a commitment to move, or be moved, to locations around the uk and overseas. we understand the impact this can have on service personnel and particularly their families and children who may travel with them. with this in mind, we have made it a condition of service to ensure personnel are provided with high quality subsided accommodation whilst they are serving.
the accommodation is a fundamental part of the overall package for service personnel and, depending on individual circumstances, can take the form of either publicly provided family or single accommodation either at their duty station or very nearby to it. mod has targets to ensure the accommodation provided is of good quality, suitably located and affordable; indeed, when compared to renting similar property types in the private sector, charges payable for mod provided accommodation are considerably lower.
in addition to providing services accommodation, the mod also operates the forces help to buy scheme. the scheme offers military personnel an interest free advance of up to 50% of their gross annual salary (capped at £25,000) to assist them buying their first home or, in particular circumstances, extending their existing home or moving property within the uk or republic of ireland. the advance is repaid directly from salary over 10 years.
more broadly, and in recognition of those personnel wanting to own their own home when they leave the military, the government has given personnel priority for government funded shared ownership schemes including the popular help to buy equity scheme. further details about these and other affordable housing schemes can be found at forces help to buy: help to get on the property ladder.

previous standards
gad adheres to the standards set out below.
the actuaries’ code
the actuaries’ code sets overriding principles for all members of the institute and faculty of actuaries (ifoa). it’s the ethical code of conduct that all members of the ifoa must adhere to.
the code has 6 principles:
integrity
competence and care
impartiality
compliance
speaking up
communication
the impartiality principle includes provisions related to conflicts of interest. at gad, we follow the requirements of the institute and faculty of actuaries relating to conflicts of interest.
quality assurance scheme
gad is proud to be accredited under the institute and faculty of actuaries’ quality assurance scheme (qas).
this is a voluntary accreditation scheme which recognises organisations’ commitments to quality actuarial work and the importance of the working environment.
the accreditation process includes an independent assessment visit. organisations must demonstrate a commitment to meeting the qas outcomes: professionalism, development and training, and organisational culture.
technical actuarial standards
gad’s uk work is produced in accordance with the financial reporting council’s (frc) technical actuarial standards (tas). the generic standard, tas 100, applies to all work which meets the frc’s definition of technical actuarial work. additional tas standards apply to specified areas of work, where the frc has identified risks to the public interest.
at gad, we seek to achieve a high standard in all our work. even if not formally in scope, we work to the spirit of the tass to help ensure the quality of our work.
other actuarial standards
in addition, all work will comply with any other relevant standards including those issued by the institute and faculty of actuaries and the financial reporting council. where we provide actuarial advice to clients based outside of the uk this will include complying with the requirements of any relevant local actuarial standards and guidance.
the civil service code
the civil service code sets out the standards of behaviour expected of civil servants.
functional standards
gad has adopted the government functional standards and these are embedded within our processes. functional standards exist to create a coherent, effective and mutually understood way of doing business within government organisations and across organisational boundaries. the standards provide a stable basis for assurance, risk management and capability improvement.
internal guidance
gad also has internal guidance on specific areas, which is available on request.
previous standards
details of the standards we have previously applied to our work are available on request.

about us
as the government’s housing and regeneration agency we believe that affordable, quality homes in well-designed places are key to improving people’s lives. together with our partners, we’re accelerating the pace of house building and regeneration across the country, as we seek to deliver homes and places people are proud to live in – for generations to come.
homes england
we make this happen by using our powers, expertise, land, capital and influence to:
form partnerships that bridge the gap between the public and private sector, in order to deliver new homes and regenerate places that meet local needs and aspirations
champion the creation of sustainable homes, communities and places that are brilliantly designed for the people that live there now, and in the future
support the creation of a more resilient, diverse and innovative housing sector by helping new market entrants and smes (small and medium-sized enterprises) grow, encouraging greater use of modern methods of construction and by promoting the utmost attention to building safety
it’s an ambitious and exciting agenda that can only be achieved through collaboration and commitment. whether you’re a local authority, housebuilder, investor, developer – whatever your role in the built environment, we’re your partner in housing and regeneration, and we’re here to help.
you can read about our mission and our strategic objectives in our strategic plan.

guidance on how to complain
before you make a complaint
contact the office you’ve been dealing with
ask for your complaint to go to a senior manager
wait for our final response
contact the independent case examiner
1. before you make a complaint
you can make a complaint if you’re unhappy with the service provided by dwp, for example if:
mistakes have been made
there were unreasonable delays
you feel you’ve been treated poorly
you haven’t been kept informed
a complaint is defined as any expression of dissatisfaction about the service provided which is not resolved by operational staff as normal business.
we will not investigate complaints:
about government policy or law
that have already been investigated or are currently being investigated by the independent case examiner or the parliamentary and health service ombudsman
that are, or have been, subject to legal proceedings, including legal settlements
challenge or appeal a benefit decision
you cannot make a complaint to challenge a benefit decision (this is known as a ‘mandatory reconsideration’) or appeal against a benefit decision, overpayment decision, child maintenance assessment or sanction.
read about how to request a mandatory reconsideration of a benefits decision.
if you disagree with the decision in a mandatory reconsideration notice, you can appeal to the social security and child support tribunal.
state pension age changes
at present, we are not investigating complaints about 1950s women and state pension age changes.
we stopped investigating these complaints on 30 november 2018 when the issue went before the high court. both the high court and the court of appeal have given judgment on this matter, in favour of the government. the supreme court refused permission to appeal but the claimants have 6 months from the date of that decision to appeal to the european court of human rights.
in the meantime, the parliamentary and health service ombudsman began an investigation. dwp will not investigate a matter that is being considered by the ombudsman.
if you have already complained to us, we will write again to inform you of the next steps.
we will continue to investigate complaints not related to state pension age changes under the normal dwp complaints procedure.
2. contact the office you’ve been dealing with
if you’d like to complain about any aspect of the service you’ve received, let the office you have been dealing with know as soon as possible.
you can contact them by phone, in person or in writing. universal credit claimants can also use their journal.
you need to let them know:
your national insurance number – unless you are an employer
your full name, address and contact numbers
which benefit you are complaining about
what happened, when it happened and how it affected you
what you want to happen to put things right
if we’ve made a mistake, we’ll put it right as soon as possible and apologise immediately. if you’ve experienced unfair treatment or suffered financially, we may consider making a special payment to you.
who to contact
use the contact details at the top of any recent letters we’ve sent you or the contact details below.
if you live in northern ireland, go to the department for communities website for more information.
to complain about an organisation that provides dwp services, for example employment programmes or health assessment providers, contact them directly. if you don’t agree with their response, they will tell you how to take things further.

about us
as the government’s housing and regeneration agency we believe that affordable, quality homes in well-designed places are key to improving people’s lives. together with our partners, we’re accelerating the pace of house building and regeneration across the country, as we seek to deliver homes and places people are proud to live in – for generations to come.
homes england
we make this happen by using our powers, expertise, land, capital and influence to:
form partnerships that bridge the gap between the public and private sector, in order to deliver new homes and regenerate places that meet local needs and aspirations
champion the creation of sustainable homes, communities and places that are brilliantly designed for the people that live there now, and in the future
support the creation of a more resilient, diverse and innovative housing sector by helping new market entrants and smes (small and medium-sized enterprises) grow, encouraging greater use of modern methods of construction and by promoting the utmost attention to building safety
it’s an ambitious and exciting agenda that can only be achieved through collaboration and commitment. whether you’re a local authority, housebuilder, investor, developer – whatever your role in the built environment, we’re your partner in housing and regeneration, and we’re here to help.
you can read about our mission and our strategic objectives in our strategic plan.

diversity and inclusion

the civil service needs a workforce with the very best possible mix of existing and future talent.
graduate entry

completing your personal statement
the purpose of a personal statement is to showcase your relevant skills and experience against the job requirements.
requirements are often referred to as the person specification or essential criteria.
the statement is your opportunity to give evidenced examples of how you fit the requirement and why you should get the job.
the following steps may help you tailor your skills and experience to the role you are applying for. you can:
stick to the word limit: a brief statement won’t provide the evidence needed to allow your application to be assessed fully. there will generally be a set word limit and we encourage you to produce as close to that number as possible to provide the required depth of detail and evidence
use the star (situation, task, action, result) model as a basis for your answers. think about what was needed, what you did and how you did it, what happened and what the outcome was
develop a draft offline first, so you can check your spelling and grammar
re-read the requirement, then read it again, to make sure you completely understand what is being looked for
seek a second opinion to check that what you have written is clear and answers the questions posed by the requirement
read it again, to make sure you are happy with it and your relevant skills and experience are clearly evidenced, before you upload it and submit
it is important that you ask questions if you are unsure about anything within the recruitment process. you can get in touch with the hiring manager or responsible recruitment team referenced within the advert / candidate pack. they are on hand to provide guidance and will be expecting to hear from you.
good luck with your statement!

how accessible are our statistics
we are committed to making our statistical outputs accessible. we have reviewed our statistical outputs and for the large majority of our statistical series, the most recent publication includes accessible versions of all outputs, in line with the public sector bodies (websites and mobile applications) accessibility regulations 2018 (the “accessibility regulations”) . there are a small number of statistical series where the elements of the latest release are not fully accessible. in particular, some of our spreadsheets may not be clearly structured with labelled tables, and labelled headings. columns headings may be blank. workbooks tabs may not have a clear title. this does not meet success criterion 1.3.1 (info and relationships) .
we are working on these remaining series and will ensure that accessible versions of the latest releases are available by the end of 2022 at the latest.
in accordance with the accessibility regulations, we have assessed the impact of making all statistics published between 23 september 2018 and 23 september 2020 fully accessible. this was deemed to be a disproportionate burden for the following reasons:
beis published around 350 statistical publications in the period 23 september 2018 to 22 september 2020. the majority of these publications are not fully accessible. making all publications fully accessible would have large resource implications, which would significantly impact on our ability to meet the current statistical needs of our users.
users of routine regular statistics bulletins should only access the most recently published iteration, which may include revisions, methodological improvements and changes, and incorporates retrospection. the latest iteration thus generally supersedes all earlier iterations.
google analytics evidence demonstrates that usage is high for the most recent iteration only, falling to negligible levels after the release of subsequent iterations, so actual usage does not support a need to proactively reproduce earlier iterations. for ad hoc releases the same trend is observed, indicating ad hocs are of primary interest close to the time of release, and this interest does not persist.
in line with the accessibility regulations, we will provide a specific statistical publication in a different format if requested.
the equality and human rights commission (in great britain) and the equality commission for northern ireland (in northern ireland) are responsible for enforcing the accessibility regulations. if you are unsatisfied with your response from beis, you may contact the equality advisory and support service or the equality commission for northern ireland.
corporate procedures and standards
we produce national and official statistics in accordance with the guidance provided in the code of practice for statistics. details on how we do this are set out in the documents below.
beis statement of compliance with the pre-release access to official statistics order 2008

archived statistics
gov.uk offers the most recent statistics beis has published. this includes statistics previously published by the department for business innovation and skills (bis) and the department of energy and climate change (decc) (both now closed).
earlier versions of the former department for business, innovation and skills website and the associated historic publications are available from the national archives.

about us
as the government’s housing and regeneration agency we believe that affordable, quality homes in well-designed places are key to improving people’s lives. together with our partners, we’re accelerating the pace of house building and regeneration across the country, as we seek to deliver homes and places people are proud to live in – for generations to come.

support the creation of a more resilient, diverse and innovative housing sector by helping new market entrants and smes (small and medium-sized enterprises) grow, encouraging greater use of modern methods of construction and by promoting the utmost attention to building safety
it’s an ambitious and exciting agenda that can only be achieved through collaboration and commitment. whether you’re a local authority, housebuilder, investor, developer – whatever your role in the built environment, we’re your partner in housing and regeneration, and we’re here to help.

work-life balance
we realise the importance of a life outside work and promote a healthy work-life balance for all our staff.
in addition, we understand that many of our staff have young children or other dependents and we endeavor to provide flexible working in line with our policies wherever possible, while ensuring that the needs of the business are met.
in order to provide a flexible way of working for staff, some departments in mhra operate a flexi-time policy. core hours vary across departments depending on the requirements of the business.
learning and development
we are committed to providing learning and development for our staff. as part of this commitment, we provide access to a curriculum of courses that are available in-house or via the civil service learning portal. in addition, staff are able to (with manager’s approval) take up external courses such as degrees, diplomas, or msc courses.
to ensure staff are fully inducted into the agency and are able to perform effectively in their role, there is a three-stage induction programme with an overview of all teams and departments built in, as well as a chance to network with the executive team.
our commitment is also evident in the continued professional development programmes we facilitate each month to continuously boost skills and knowledge, and further develop talent in the agency.
team building
we are committed to improving internal working relationships and communication through all-staff meetings, briefings at divisional meetings and the use of our staff intranet. in addition to this, our open-plan offices encourage communication and interaction between staff.
there are opportunities to join the staff network and have a say in how matters that affect staff are developed and dealt with.
team development days/away days provide a good way for teams to bond whilst working out strategically how the team will meet its objectives. this is a way to celebrate success, spend some time together and support each other with further development.

opening times:

find out about call charges: https://www.gov.uk/call-charges
how we treat your complaints
when we receive a complaint, we immediately refer it to an appropriate staff member who will then carry out an investigation.
we will reply in writing, or by telephone, within 15 working days from when we receive your complaint. if it is not possible for us to fully respond to you within this time, we will let you know and tell you what we are doing to deal with your complaint, when you can expect the full reply and from whom.
we will always acknowledge where things could have been done better and tell you what we will do to avoid the same thing happening again. equally, if we don’t agree with your complaint, we will let you know why.
what to do if you aren’t satisfied
the full reply to your complaint will include details of who to contact next if you think we have not dealt with it properly. this will normally be an appropriate senior departmental official.
that is the final stage of review for any complaint within dfe but, if you are still unhappy, you can refer your complaint to the parliamentary and health service ombudsman through your local mp.
our customer service standards
our ministerial and public communications division deals with most of our letters, emails, telephone enquiries and consultations.
we aim to:
respond to your letters and emails (including complaints) within 15 working days, or 20 days for freedom of information requests (in line with government standards)
answer at least 90% of calls within 30 seconds between 9.30am and 5pm on working weekdays
give you a response from the person best placed to answer your questions or provide the advice you need
be as polite, clear and helpful as possible
encourage you to give us feedback on our service so we can improve it
however we cannot respond to complainants who use obscenities, racist or homophobic language, or who are personally offensive about members of our staff.
questions we can’t help with
the procedure explained here is not for complaints about particular government policies. if you have a complaint about a policy, you can contact the minister for that policy, or alternatively contact your local mp.
complain about a school or an academy
if you need to complain about a school or an academy, you should first approach them direct and complete their complaints procedure. this should be published on their website. you can use the ‘get information about schools’ service to find the school’s website and view their complaints procedure.
find out who to complain to if you believe your complaint wasn’t handled correctly.
complaints advice for schools
all schools, including academies and free schools, must set up a complaints procedure.
further guidance for schools and guidance for academies is available.
complain about an early years provider
if you need to complain about an early years setting or childcare provider, you should approach them directly.
all early years settings (including childminders) must set up a complaints procedure.
contact ofsted if you feel your complaint was not resolved or if you think ofsted need to be made aware of it.
complain about local authority children’s services
if you need to complain about children’s social care or the child death review process within a local authority, you should approach the local authority directly.
all local authorities must set up a complaints procedure. contact your local authority directly to find out how to make a complaint.
contact your local ombudsman if you feel your complaint was not handled according to the local authority’s complaints procedure. you should also contact your local ombudsman if you wish to complain about the way your local authority handled a child death review.
complain about a higher education (he) provider
if you have a complaint about your he provider you should contact them directly.
your provider will have a complaints procedure you can follow and will send you a ‘completion of procedures’ letter at the end of the process.
contact the office of the independent adjudicator for higher education (oia) if your complaint cannot be resolved though the provider’s complaints process.
the oia can only support current or former he students.
the government:
cannot get involved in individual disputes between english universities and their students
does not review oia decisions
complain about a skills bootcamps course
learners and employers who want to complain about a course should contact their training providers. all skills bootcamp training providers must have a complaints procedure.
if you feel your complaint has been handled poorly, or the training provider has unduly delayed their response, you can complain about the handling of your complaint.
we will need the following information:
the name of the skills bootcamp course and training provider
the details of your complaint, including key dates
a copy of the original complaint sent to the training provider
if available, a copy of the letter or email from the training provider setting out the final response to your appeal
permission to disclose details of your complaint to the training provider
if you’re acting on behalf of a learner, evidence of their permission to do so
complain about an initial teacher training (itt) application
you can use the apply for teacher training page if you have a complaint about an itt application, including if you’ve been treated unfairly.
report a concern about a child or young person’s safety or welfare
if you are concerned about a child or young person, you should:
call 999 if you think the child or young person is in immediate danger
call the local police on 101 if you think a crime has been committed against the child or young person
contact your local council if you think a child or young person is at risk or is being abused or neglected
whistleblowing
if you work in an early years or educational setting, or a children’s social care service, and are concerned about suspected wrongdoing, you should follow the institution’s process for ‘blowing the whistle’.
if you are a professional with concerns about how child protection issues are being handled in your organisation, or another organisation, you should contact the national child abuse whistleblowing advice line on 0800 028 0285 or help@nspcc.org.uk.
all local-authority-maintained schools should set up a whistleblowing procedure.
report fraud
if you believe there is fraud or financial wrongdoing at an organisation we fund email full details, including the name of the organisation, to fraud.reports@education.gov.uk.
we will investigate cases where there is enough evidence.
during an investigation, we will try to keep your identity confidential, but we cannot guarantee it. in sufficiently serious cases, we may reveal your identity to the police or other authorities.

administer bursary payments on behalf of many uk he providers
work with hmrc to collect repayments through paye and self-assessment systems while directly collecting from borrowers outside the uk tax system or those nearing the end of their repayment term.

written requests
information not published under this scheme, or not available elsewhere on gov.uk website, can be requested by e-mailing:
email: foirequests@slc.co.uk
requests are dealt with in accordance with the timescales of the foi act or other relevant legislation (eg the general data protection act 2018, student finance regulations).
information not made available
there will be occasions when we will not be able to supply all the information requested. these will only be in respect of information specifically exempted under the freedom of information act, in particular when we are constrained by considerations of:
national security
legal and contractual obligations
our duty to keep sensitive information about individuals confidential
we will always make clear on such occasions why information is withheld. members of the public have the right to appeal to the information commissioner against such a decision. anything not published under the scheme can be requested under the freedom of information act by e-mailing: foirequests@slc.co.uk
format
normally material will be made available electronically. paper copies will be made available on request.
charges
in general, slc does not charge for information provision, but retains the right to charge for written requests in line with the foi regulations. where a request for information would be excessively costly to deliver, slc will endeavour to liaise with the requesting body to determine a less costly solution. this decision will be reviewed on the same timeframe as the review of the publication scheme.

under the equality act 2010, we have a legal duty to publish information that shows compliance with the public sector equality duty, and to publish our equality objectives.
equalities in policymaking and delivery
equality and diversity are critical to delivering dfe’s vision: we enable children and learners to thrive by protecting the vulnerable and ensuring the delivery of excellent standards of education, training and care. this helps realise everyone’s potential – and that powers our economy, strengthens society and increases fairness.
specific examples of our equality analysis
to deliver on our wider equality and diversity objectives, we invest in excellent analysis and research, some good-practice examples of which are provided here.
equality impact assessments:
higher education reform: equality impact assessment
school rebuilding programme: equalities impact assessments

who we are
we employ around 17,000 staff and operate from locations in england, wales, scotland and northern ireland.
our responsibilities
through the courts and tribunals we give people and businesses access to justice, including:
victims and witnesses of crime
defendants accused of crimes
consumers in debt or with other disputes
people involved in the adoption or protection of children
businesses involved in commercial disputes
individuals asserting their employment rights or challenging the decisions of government bodies
people affected by relationship breakdown
we follow the ministry of justice’s strategic vision for reform, to create a more effective, less costly and more responsive justice system for the public.
we’re responsible for:
providing the supporting administration for a fair, efficient and accessible courts and tribunal system
supporting an independent judiciary in the administration of justice
driving improvements across all aspects of the administration of the courts and tribunals
collaborating effectively with other justice organisations and agencies, including the legal professions, to improve access to justice
working with government departments and agencies to improve the quality and timeliness of their decision-making, which will reduce the number of cases coming before courts and tribunals
we launched our £1bn reform programme in 2016. four years on, and working closely with the wider judiciary, legal professionals and users of our justice system – are making considerable progress towards making that long-term vision a reality.
our reform programme page contains more information and updates from each of the jurisdictional areas.

overview
at natural england, science, evidence and analysis are at the heart of our advice, operations and regulatory activity.
to achieve our vision of thriving nature for people and planet, we need to understand:
what changes are occurring in the natural environment
what interventions and actions work well
our science, evidence and evaluation strategy sets out how we will achieve our ambition to be an evidence-led organisation. we work in partnership, across ecological, economic and social sciences to underpin our actions and decisions with robust data and evidence.
our science, evidence and analytical capability continues to grow. 79% of our staff are linked with one or more civil service professions. over a quarter of our staff have professional membership of one or more industry professional bodies.
our chief scientist, dr tim hill, takes the lead on this work.
our annual chief scientist report explains how we use evidence in nature’s recovery.
our natural england action plan also sets out our current priorities.
investing in science and evidence
natural england’s science and evidence portfolio oversees the evidence needs of the organisation. it delivers projects through a combination of in-house expertise, collaborative work with partners, grants and external contracts. examples include:
the natural capital ecosystem assessment programme
refining dna-based methods for monitoring, assessing and managing the environment - for example the application of edna techniques in mapping great crested newt populations
delivering nature-based solutions for climate change at the landscape scale programme
preparation of a state of natural capital report and embedding natural capital evidence in our work
read our publications in our access to evidence catalogue.
supporting strategic research and innovation
building partnerships for nature’s recovery is natural england’s mission. there are many ways to work in partnership with us, from informal arrangements to more formalised partnership agreements.
we also support a range of studentships and internships each year, working with a wide range of universities and research institutes. our national nature reserves research portal has information about suggested topics for dissertation projects based on our national nature reserves.
to look to the future, natural england utilises horizon scanning, systems thinking and innovation to consider emerging issues. we worked closely with the government office for science to shape the futures toolkit which we use in practice to direct our futures thinking.
using our evidence
high quality science, data and evidence underpin the advice we provide on the natural environment.
we continue to improve and develop new and existing projects. this means our best available evidence can be applied to decision making by investing in:
modernising and updating our digital and data systems
delivering environmental research, monitoring and analysis
evolving technologies including earth observation and data science techniques
evaluating our work
you can find out more about some of our environmental monitoring activities and how we apply new technologies on our natural england blog. this covers projects such as our people and nature survey (pans), and the creation of a national scale habitat map from satellite imagery and field observations.
you can use natural england’s data and derived evidence products or statistics in your work or study.
we have published our core principles and ways of working with data and evidence as a set of standards.
evaluating our work
we are committed to evaluating and learning from our projects, programmes, and delivery. we do this to understand what works for people and the natural environment, in line with formal government guidance set out in the magenta book. evaluation is a critical part of being an evidence-led organisation, in line with our science evidence and evaluation strategy.
we are keen to work with the wider sector to address the challenges of how we:
evaluate and learn from our projects and programmes
can innovate and build knowledge about what works for nature recovery

5 may 2023: corrections to the childcare and early years providers survey 2022
an error has been identified which affects results from the childcare and early years providers survey: 2022. revised figures were published on 5 may 2023.
the error came about because a small number of childcare providers (approximately 0.9% of the providers that responded to the survey) were incorrectly counted in the statistics. they should not have been included, because they do not provide childcare to children aged 0 to 4.
the error has been thoroughly investigated. as a result of the error, previously published estimates of the total number of childcare providers in england were approximately 600 (or 1.0%) higher than they should have been. estimates of the total number of paid childcare staff in england were approximately 5,400 (or 1.6%) higher than they should have been.
further details of the error and the effect it had on the figures are provided in the methodology section of the corrected statistics. we apologise for any inconvenience caused.

5 july 2022: technical issue with key stage 2 attainment statistics
this morning, dfe released national headline statistics on key stage 2 attainment. there were technical issues with our explore education statistics platform that meant the statistics were not available at 9:30am. these issues were unrelated to those experienced by schools accessing their individual results.
once this issue was identified, as an interim solution, the statistics were made available through an accessible pdf document that went live on gov.uk at approximately 10:45am. the issues with the explore education statistics platform have now been rectified, with statistics available through that platform at approximately 11:10am.
i would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused and to assure you that i take the issue very seriously. we are reviewing the website and any improvements that can be made to avoid this happening again in future.

13 june 2022: changes to the publication of the fe choices learner satisfaction survey
the fe choices learner satisfaction surveys 2019 to 2020 and 2020 to 2021 were cancelled due to the coronavirus (covid-19) outbreak.
in 2020 to 2021, the department for education (dfe) conducted the fe covid-19 learner and apprentice experience survey to understand the experiences of fe learners during the covid-19 outbreak. this was published in april 2022.
dfe does not intend to run the satisfaction survey again in its current form. dfe will instead be considering the most useful information to collect from learners that best supports the proposals laid out in last year’s public consultation document skills for jobs: a new further education funding and accountability system, taking into account the responses to that consultation.
neil mcivor, dfe chief statistician
3 february 2022: correction to apprenticeship national achievement rates
an error has been discovered which affects the 2019 to 2020 national apprenticeship achievement rate, which was originally published in march 2021 in the apprenticeships and traineeships release.
the error has identified people who had withdrawn from their apprenticeship programme but who, at the time of publishing, were thought to have continued into the next year.
in line with the code of practice for statistics, we have taken down rates for 2019 to 2020 until new data is available. this only impacts on the section in the release headed ‘national achievement rate tables’ (narts). other areas of the release are not affected. i would like to apologise for this error and for the data being unavailable while the updated figures are calculated.
my teams need to complete the full production cycle for 2020 to 2021 in order to provide new data for 2020 to 2021 and revisions to any preceding years, which will include full quality assurance of the 2019 to 2020 data.
the error is likely to lead to a reduction to the overall 2019 to 2020 rate that was previously published, but the size of the impact can only be robustly quantified once the revised data is calculated. this revised data for 2019 to 2020 will form part of the national high-level 3-year time series, containing data for 2018/2019 to 2020/2021, which is scheduled for publication in march 2022. once that data has been calculated and quality assured, national level data for 2019 to 2020 will be available again.
in publishing the 2019 to 2020 narts in march 2021, the release did not contain any provider-level data, including provider type following the government’s announcement that the data would not be used for accountability purposes. the release only covered high-level national aggregations which are made available for transparency only.
for provider-level data, you should use the last full data published for 2018 to 2019.

28 january 2021: correction to workforce absence data for teaching assistants and other staff
an error was identified that affected national level absence rates for ‘teaching assistants and other staff’ published on 19 january in the ‘attendance in education and early years settings during the coronavirus (covid-19) outbreak’ statistical publication.
the affected data were removed from the publication on 27 january and corrected on 28 january. known users of this data are being contacted directly to alert them to this correction.
the error meant that absence rates were overreported for ‘teaching assistants and other staff’ at national level. the corrected data shows that teaching assistants and other staff have broadly similar absence rates to teachers and school leaders.
a full list of affected measures and further details about the cause of this error is available in the methodology section of the release. data used by government as management information, as set out in the ‘data sharing’ section of the publication, was unaffected.
i would like to apologise for this error and assure you that i take the issue of data quality very seriously. we are reviewing how this was missed through our checking processes to improve them in future.

the independence is preserved by the adjudicator’s terms of appointment.

we do this by being impartial and increasingly effective and efficient in our administration. we help the honest majority to get their tax right and make it hard for the dishonest minority to cheat the system.

how we tested our documents
what we’re doing to improve accessibility
it covers pdfs, spreadsheets, presentations and other types of documents.
it doesn’t cover content published on gov.uk as html: the main gov.uk accessibility statement will cover that.
using our documents
sellafield ltd publishes documents in a range of formats, including: pdfs and excel documents.
we want as many people as possible to be able to use those documents. for example, when we produce a document we make sure to:
provide an html option where possible
tag headings and other parts of the document properly, so screen readers can understand the page structure
make sure we include alt text alongside non-decorative images, so people who can’t see them understand what they’re there for
avoid using tables, except when we’re presenting data
write in plain english
how accessible our documents are
new documents we publish and documents you need to download or fill in to access one of the services we provide should be fully accessible.
however, we know that some of our older documents (published before 23 september 2018) aren’t accessible. for example, some of them:
are just photocopies and aren’t marked up in a way that allows screen reader users to understand them
aren’t tagged up properly - for example, they don’t contain proper headings
aren’t written in plain english
this mostly applies to our office file formats which are needed for active administrative processes. these types of documents are exempt from the regulations, we currently don’t have any plans to make them accessible.
what to do if you can’t use one of our documents
if you need a document we’ve published in a different format:
email: enquiries@sellafieldsites.com
call: 019467 73350
we’ll consider the request and get back to you in 5 working days.
reporting accessibility problems with one of our documents
we’re always looking to improve the accessibility of our documents. if you find any problems that aren’t listed on this page or you think we’re not meeting accessibility requirements, use the details above to contact us.
enforcement procedure
the equality and human rights commission (ehrc) is responsible for enforcing the public sector bodies (websites and mobile applications)(no.2) accessibility regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). if you’re happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the equality advisory and support services (eass).
technical information about the accessibility of our documents
we are committed to making our documents accessible, in accordance with the public sector bodies (websites and mobile applications)(no.2) accessibility regulations 2018.
the documents we publish are partially compliant with the web content accessibility guidelines version 2.1 aa standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.
non accessible content
the content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
non compliance with the accessibility regulations
a few of our documents have diagrams. these images don’t have a text alternative, so the information in them isn’t available to people using screen reader. this doesn’t meet wcag 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content)
we plan to add text alternatives for all diagrams by september 2020. when we publish new documents we’ll make sure our diagrams meet accessibility standards.
a few of our audio files have no captions/subtitles. these files don’t have a text alternative, so the information in them isn’t available to people with hearing difficulties. this doesn’t meet wcag 2.1 success criterion 1.2.1 audio-only and video-only (pre recorded)
we plan to add subtitles to all audio files by september 2020. when we publish new documents we’ll make sure our audio files meets accessibility standards.
many of our older pdfs and word documents don’t meet accessibility standards - for example, they may not be structured so they’re accessible to a screen reader. this doesn’t meet wcag 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2.
some of our pdfs and word documents are essential to providing our service. for example, we have pdfs with information on how users can access our services, and forms published as word documents. by september 2020, we plan to either fix these or replace them with accessible html pages.
disproportionate burden
content that’s not within the scope of accessibility regulations
many of our older pdfs and word documents do not meet accessibility standards - for example, they may not be structured so they’re accessible to a screen reader. this does not meet wcag 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (name, role, value)
the accessibility regulations don’t require us to fix pdfs or other documents published before 23 september 2018 if they’re not essential to providing our services. for example, we don’t plan to fix any of our strategy documents.
any new pdfs or word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.
how we tested our documents
we last tested a sample of our documents on 5 september 2019.
we tested:
a pdf document
an excel document
a word document
what we’re doing to improve accessibility
we are ensuring that all authors of documents that are published externally are aware of the requirements to create accessible document, and we are training employees responsible for creating and publishing documents so that they can check that all future publications meet accessibility standards.
the last 12 months of published pdf documents will be converted in a pdf/a, pdf/x or pdf/e format and republished on gov.uk. for those documents that are in an excel format, these will be converted into html files and also republished on gov.uk.
where word documents have been used, these will be checked against the accessibility checker in microsoft office and amended if needed. these documents will then be republished on gov.uk
this page was prepared on the 17 september. it was last updated on the 17 september.

accommodation for those who serve
the ministry of defence (mod) is a central government department with a mission to protect our country and provide the ultimate guarantee of its security and independence, as well as helping to protect its values and interests abroad.
to do this we must meet a complex range of threats and challenges in a rapidly changing world. we must adapt to stay ahead and shape our capability to address tomorrow’s threats, not yesterday’s. we will build more versatile and agile forces for the future, and ensure our people have what they need to do what we ask of them. we cannot do everything on our own, so we must work effectively with our allies and partners.
we offer a range of careers both in the armed forces, reserves and civilians so however you want to contribute to our mission, either through serving in the british army, royal navy, royal air force or as a civil servant, there will be something to suit you.
join the armed forces

join the reserves
the uk reserve forces play a vital part in our nation’s defence. find out how you can get involved and what is on offer for reserves.
is it for you?
all types of people are putting their spare time to better use as reserves in the armed forces. being a reserve is as rewarding as it is challenging. you’ll train and deploy alongside our regular forces, doing things you never pictured yourself doing, learning new skills and meeting people who, like you, want more from life. read about it from others who have taken up the challenge: reserves case studies.

we employ people in so many different roles and in many locations across the uk and abroad. we have jobs in policy, finance, hr, it commercial and project management and all the types of jobs you would expect to find in a government department. we also employ doctors, dentists, teachers, police, fire service, quantity surveyors, engineers to name a few. we have many opportunities to become an apprentice in the ministry of defence. so think of any type of job and you may find it in the mod.

apprenticeships
mod is the largest provider of apprenticeships in the uk. find out about apprenticeships for civil servants and the armed forces.
apprenticeships in the ministry of defence guard service
a wide range of apprenticeships are available to new and existing mgs staff, making them a great option for anyone looking to enhance their knowledge and skills in their current role or to support career progression. apprenticeships are available in many professional areas, including operational delivery, customer service and leadership and management.
the mgs recognise the value of learning in enabling sustainable delivery of its business objectives and have invested in a full time apprenticeship coordinator to provide help and support to the apprentice and line manager.
school leavers and welbeck college
school leavers
whether involved in combat, peacekeeping duties or the provision of humanitarian aid following natural disasters, the armed forces depend on the support and expertise provided by our civilian staff. we would like this to be you.
the mod offers many varied opportunities for school leavers throughout the uk where you can make a real difference to defence. the number of different careers are too many to list in full, but they include personal secretary, pay clerk, commercial officer, project and admin support, finance clerk, commodity manager, course administrator and recruitment and marketing, along with many others.
all these roles are absolutely vital to our mission in defence, giving a unique vision and access to some of the most interesting work in government. perhaps you could be a commercial officer buying vehicles for the army. perhaps you could be a personal secretary to a senior civil servant who decides the latest defence policy. perhaps you could be a commodity manager routeing supplies to a recent disaster area.
but we don’t just focus on your current job, we place an enormous emphasis on your future. every single person in the organisation is given comprehensive training and development, including the opportunity to develop cross disciplines.
as the mod is so large it is entirely possible to change career direction, perhaps even study for professional qualifications, while retaining your status and similar conditions of employment, including your pension and leave allowance. examples would be engineers moving into personnel or accountancy, and administrators becoming graphic designers or logicians.
this is in addition to a number of management development schemes aimed at the full spectrum of the mod workforce, designed to help you fulfil your true potential.
welbeck: the defence sixth form college
welbeck college in leicestershire is an mod sponsored sixth form college that invests in the future of young people who have a strong desire to take up a science or engineering based career in the armed forces or the civil service.
welbeck has provided the army with many of its future technical officers for over 50 years. in 2004 the college became a quad-service institution, admitting students with a career ambition to join the royal navy, the british army, the royal air force or to become mod civil service engineers.
the college has become one of the uk’s top sixth form colleges and has an outstanding academic reputation. it offers a unique programme of personal, physical and intellectual development which provides our students with a rounded education specifically designed to meet the needs of today’s modern technical armed forces.
the programme does not end after a 2 year a-level programme, the mod continues to monitor and support students through university and on to professional training with their respective armed service or within the mod civil service.
graduate recruitment programmes
fast stream
our premiere development scheme for graduates is fast stream, although many graduates also enter through applying for vacancies on civil service jobs.
defence commercial graduate programme
the defence commercial graduate programme recruits graduates for mod purchasing and contract management roles. full details available in the commercial graduate brochure.
desg
the mod also recruits engineering and science graduates into desg via various schemes.
security vetting
we process 3 main types of national security vetting (nsv) checks and clearances.
counter terrorist check (ctc) for people employed in posts with proximity to public figures, access to information or material assessed to be of value to terrorists or unescorted access to establishments assessed to be at risk from terrorist attack. a ctc does not allow a person access to or knowledge of protectively marked assets.
security check (sc) for people employed in posts which have substantial access to secret assets or occasional controlled access to top secret assets.
developed vetting (dv) is needed for people with substantial unsupervised access to top secret assets.
a small number of clearances are granted where the risks are managed through follow up work and monitoring. we call this activity ‘aftercare’. we also process aftercare for all mod clearances that are granted normally.
see united kingdom security vetting: forms and guidance.
diversity and inclusion
the ministry of defence is committed to recruiting and retaining the best possible people from across the country, regardless of background, gender, ethnicity, working pattern, caring responsibilities, sexual orientation or, for civil servants, whether they are disabled.
this is not only morally the right thing to do, but is fundamental to the operational effectiveness of defence.
we are striving to be an employer of choice through recognising, encouraging and celebrating diversity, and ensuring everyone in defence plays their part in promoting an inclusive working environment and respecting and valuing the unique contribution of each individual.
our work to become a more diverse and inclusive organisation is being driven by the defence diversity and inclusion programme which was established in 2013 and covers both civilian and military employees.
as a part of this programme we are working to meet the government’s aspiration for 10% of new recruits into the armed forces to be from bame communities by 2020. additionally we are striving to meet a target of 15% of new recruits into the armed forces to be female by 2020.
while recruitment is an important element of our work, the wider defence diversity and inclusion programme takes a much broader view of diversity and inclusion and is driving real change by embedding diversity and inclusion within our leadership and culture and taking steps to increase the retention and progression of people from under represented groups. this all encompassing approach to diversity and inclusion is essential if the department is to retain the high quality people that we recruit.

all candidates will be treated respectfully, equitably and honestly irrespective of race, ethnic origin, religion or belief, gender, sexual orientation or social background. the armed forces recognise and value individuals from diverse backgrounds who bring with them fresh ideas, knowledge, experience and talent.
family friendly policies in the armed forces
the armed forces offer occupational leave schemes which follow, and in some cases, exceed statutory provision for maternity, paternity and adoption leave.
armed forces occupational maternity scheme
all servicewomen regardless of their length of service are entitled to 52 weeks of maternity leave. eligible servicewomen are also entitled to receive statutory maternity pay. the armed forces occupational maternity scheme (afoms) provides qualifying women (those who have at least a year’s continuous service and who intend to return to work for a minimum of 12 months following maternity leave) with full pay for the first 26 weeks of ordinary maternity leave.
servicewomen who have given birth are screened from deployment in the uk or overseas for at least 6 months after the birth of their child, unless they volunteer otherwise. the services also endeavour not to deploy both serving parents at the same time, where this does not compromise operational capability.
the armed forces occupational paternity leave scheme provides qualifying fathers with 14 days of ordinary paternity leave, instead of the statutory provision of 10 days, with 2 weeks’ full pay rather than the statutory paternity pay rate at the time of the birth of a child or a child’s placement in the case of adoptions. additional paternity leave was introduced for members of the armed forces in 2011 and this enables parents to share responsibility for looking after their children in the case of births and placements for adoption.
the armed forces are exempt from the flexible working provisions of uk employment legislation, as working patterns that might compromise the operational flexibility of the armed forces are incompatible with regular service. arrangements are in place to improve, where possible, the work-life balance of both male and female personnel. these include:
transfer of leave between spouses and civil partners: this allows a service person to donate or receive up to 10 days of annual leave to their civil partner or spouse. this can be useful if one partner has used up much of their leave, or if a partner has more leave than they can carry over into the next year.
call forward of leave: this allows a service person to bring 10 days of leave from the next leave year, and use them in the current leave year. this can be helpful if the service person is aware that they will deploy in the next leave year, and will find themselves unable to use all of that year’s leave entitlement, due to operational commitments.
enhanced leave: this allows service personnel who have served in the armed forces for 15 years or more a once in career opportunity to take 10 weeks (50 working days) off work in a block, by trading in their 30 days leave allowance for that year. this gives personnel the opportunity to take up once in a lifetime opportunities, have that extension built, or simply take a period of much deserved down time.
flexible working: this has always existed within the armed forces, but are being more widely encouraged. there are 3 types of flexible working:
compressed hours: allows service personnel to potentially work slightly longer some days of the week in order to take a shorter day.
working from home: allows service personnel to use existing it to work from home on either a regular or infrequent basis.
variable start and finish times: allows a service person to start and finish at different times during the working week.
further schemes and services available for armed forces personnel and their families, including support through the armed forces covenant on education, employment, housing, finance and accommodation, are available here.
accommodation for those who serve
being a regular member of the armed forces infers a commitment to move, or be moved, to locations around the uk and overseas. we understand the impact this can have on service personnel and particularly their families and children who may travel with them. with this in mind, we have made it a condition of service to ensure personnel are provided with high quality subsided accommodation whilst they are serving.
the accommodation is a fundamental part of the overall package for service personnel and, depending on individual circumstances, can take the form of either publicly provided family or single accommodation either at their duty station or very nearby to it. mod has targets to ensure the accommodation provided is of good quality, suitably located and affordable; indeed, when compared to renting similar property types in the private sector, charges payable for mod provided accommodation are considerably lower.
in addition to providing services accommodation, the mod also operates the forces help to buy scheme. the scheme offers military personnel an interest free advance of up to 50% of their gross annual salary (capped at £25,000) to assist them buying their first home or, in particular circumstances, extending their existing home or moving property within the uk or republic of ireland. the advance is repaid directly from salary over 10 years.
more broadly, and in recognition of those personnel wanting to own their own home when they leave the military, the government has given personnel priority for government funded shared ownership schemes including the popular help to buy equity scheme. further details about these and other affordable housing schemes can be found at forces help to buy: help to get on the property ladder.

quality assurance framework
our social research aims to provide high-quality evidence to inform policy development and delivery.
research following children and young people of the 2020s
we’re running a new programme of research to understand the lives of children and young people growing up in the 2020s. the studies will provide vital insights into the wellbeing and education outcomes of children and young people in the key phases of education, from early years to post-16.
the following studies are being conducted on behalf of dfe and are underway.
children of the 2020s - ipsos is conducting the study between 2022 and 2027, following children’s learning and development from age 9 months to 5 years.
five to twelve - the national centre for social research (natcen) is conducting the study from 2023 until 2029, following children and their families from year 1 to year 6. if you have been contacted about participating in the study, send enquiries to fivetotwelve@natcen.ac.uk or freephone 0800 652 4568, monday to friday 9am to 5pm.
areas of research interest
dfe’s areas of research interest sets out the topics we would like to engage external researchers with. we expect to release further areas of research prompted by the challenges posed by coronavirus (covid-19) shortly.
dfe data for research
read our guidance on accessing dfe data extracts from the national pupil database (npd), school workforce, individualised learner record and higher education statistics agency.
research projects
routes to market for social and economic research
all new projects are being procured via 2 crown commercial service dynamic purchasing systems:
low value purchase system - provides public sector buyers with a new route to market for their below threshold common goods and services (under £120,000)
research and insights marketplace - enables central government and the wider public sector to commission social, market and economic research expertise and services
if you want to be invited to tender for research commissioned by dfe, you should register as a supplier on both systems.
registration is free and there is no limit to the number of suppliers who can join.
jaggaer: the dfe e-tendering portal
jaggaer is an e-tendering system used by dfe and its executive agencies. it is a password-protected online service.
as a potential supplier, you should register with jaggaer so that you can:
view opportunities to tender
submit tender responses
for help with registration, use the support links on the jaggaer portal.
publications
use the style guide and template to write your research publications.
you can find our research reports published since may 2010 in gov.uk’s publications section.
research published before may 2010 is available from the uk government web archive.
quality assurance framework
the framework sets out a standardised approach to quality assurance to ensure that analysis is:
fit for purpose
reliable
accurate
transparent
accountable

how we process your personal data
uk procurement law
we must follow uk laws that govern how we may buy goods, services and works over a specified value or ‘threshold’.
where we expect the estimated value of a contract to be over the relevant threshold, we must advertise our requirements on the find a tender service (fts).
the procurement thresholds are published by the cabinet office.
transforming public procurement (tpp)
in december 2020, the cabinet office published the green paper ‘transforming public procurement’ which set out significant reforms aimed at speeding up and simplifying public procurement. the development and implementation of these reforms is owned and managed by the cabinet office.
the transforming public procurement programme aims to improve the way public procurement is regulated in order to:
c​reate a simpler and more flexible, commercial system that better meets our country’s needs while remaining compliant with our international obligations
open up public procurement to new entrants such as small businesses and social enterprises so that they can compete for and win more public contracts
embed transparency throughout the commercial lifecycle so that the spending of taxpayers’ money can be properly scrutinised
the procurement bill, which will reform the existing procurement rules, has now received royal assent. you can view the new procurement act on the uk legislation website, and the official record of the bill’s progress through parliament, with all supporting documents on the parliamentary website.
visit the designated tpp page to find out more about how public procurement will change to improve the way supplies, services and works are procured for the public sector.
latest contracting opportunities
we, and our executive agencies, advertise new contracting opportunities in the following places, where appropriate:
the uk e-notification service, find a tender (fts)
dfe’s research page
contracts finder
specialist publications, and trade, national and local press
jaggaer
forthcoming opportunities
we use a variety of means to notify suppliers of future opportunities, including:
advertising prior information notices (pin) on the fts website
publishing notices on contracts finder
publishing opportunities to tender on jaggaer
department for education commercial pipeline data: 2020 to 2021
duns numbers
‘duns numbers’ provide us with valuable information about which suppliers are bidding for our contracts. we encourage interested suppliers to register with duns numbers.
prompt payment policy
we follow government policy and pay all correctly submitted invoices within 10 days of receiving them at the physical or electronic address that we’ve specified.
educational and children’s social care professionals dynamic purchasing system (ecsc dps)
the education and children’s social care dynamic purchasing system (ecsc dps) has moved to the jaggaer commercial platform.
we use the ecsc dps to buy professional, educational and children’s social care services to support government policy in schools and local authorities.
if you would like to apply to join the ecsc dps, you can do so by logging in or registering on the jaggaer portal.
as a potential supplier you should register with jaggaer and apply to join the ecsc dps so that you can:
apply to become a member of the ecsc dps
view ecsc dps opportunities to tender
submit ecsc dps tender responses
prior to 22 december 2020, the dfe used redimo2 to host the ecsc dps. all ecsc dps members who gained approval prior to the 22 december 2020 will be migrated to jaggaer with their membership status retained.
further information on how this will be managed and any action required has been issued directly to existing members.
for any queries, please email the commercial contact point team.
commercial contact point team
email commercial.contactpoint@education.gov.uk
terms and conditions for using the ecsc dps

jaggaer: the dfe etendering portal

as a potential supplier you should register with jaggaer so that you can:

for help with registration please use the support links on the jaggaer portal.
standard terms and conditions for dfe contracts
if you would like to know which terms and conditions apply when bidding for a particular dfe contract, contact the person named in the advertisement and tender documentation.
generally, we use the cabinet office short form, mid-tier and model services contract terms and conditions which are regularly updated. we may augment these terms with a small number of dfe specific terms and conditions.

overview
we carry out driving tests, approve people to be driving instructors and mot testers, carry out tests to make sure lorries and buses are safe to drive, carry out roadside checks on drivers and vehicles, and monitor vehicle recalls.
find out more about the services we provide.
we are an executive agency of the department for transport (dft). the data controller for dvsa is dft – a data controller determines the reasons and how personal data is processed. for more information, see the information commissioner’s office (ico) data protection public register. dft’s registration number is z7122992.
so that you can use these services, we need to collect, use, store and sometimes share your personal information.
what personal data is
personal data is information that can identify a living person. it lets you identify them either:
directly, for example, their name
indirectly, for example, their driving licence number
personal data can include things such as:
names
identification numbers
location data
online usernames or id
data about health, genetics, economics, culture, social identity or ethnicity
your personal data is protected by law. it protects how it is collected, used and stored.
when we need your data
when we need to collect, store or use your personal data, we will:
have a good reason to do it and only ask for what we need
do so in a fair and transparent way
tell you why we need your information and how we’ll use it
only use your information how we say we’ll use it, and not in a way you would not expect without asking/telling you first
only keep what we need, and will not keep it for longer than we need
make sure it’s accurate and up to date, and that nobody has access to it who should not
keep it safe and secure
if you use one of our websites, we will share anonymised data with gov.uk and the government digital service on how you used the site. this will usually be via google analytics.
give us accurate data and tell us when things change
make sure the data you give us is accurate and let us know if it changes. for example, if you change your:
name
address
telephone number
if your data is not correct, if could have an impact on you, for example, communications from us may go to your previous address or email address or if you pass your test your driving licence may go to a previous address
your sensitive (special category) data
we follow extra rules when we collect, use and store more sensitive personal data. this is called ‘special category’ data. it includes things like race, ethnic origin, trade union membership, health and sexual orientation.
criminal data
when we process personal data to enforce criminal law, we categorise individuals so that their role is clear, for example, witness, victim, suspect or convicted criminal.
we record whether the information is opinion or fact, and keep detailed logs of how we handle the data.
we may include your personal data in press releases following successful prosecutions.
we may also process criminal data during the recruitment process. we will only seek this information once a job offer has been made to you and we will inform you that we are doing so.
mandatory retention
we have been told to keep all documents, correspondence, notes, emails and all other information – however held – which contain or may contain content relating directly or indirectly to the sexual abuse of children. a child, in this case, is any person under the age of 18.
reasons we can process your personal data
we can only process personal data for one or more of the following reasons:
you’ve freely given your consent, it’s clear what you’re consenting to, and how you can withdraw your consent
you’ve entered (or intend to enter) into a contract with us
for legal reasons
to protect someone’s ‘vital interests’ (a matter of life or death)
to perform a public task or perform a specific task that’s in the public interest
for our own or a third party’s legitimate interests - but only where the personal data is going to be used in ways that are reasonably expected and are not intrusive, or where there are compelling reasons to process it
these reasons are sometimes called ‘lawful bases’.
the reason we process your personal data affects the rights you have over it. we process data to meet our legal obligations and to perform public tasks.
your rights over your personal data
by law, you have the right to:
access your data - you can access your personal data free of charge and in any format
be informed - you should know and understand what happens with your data and why
be forgotten - without a ‘compelling reason’ to keep your data, we must delete it
move your data - you can obtain and reuse your personal data with other services
limit how your data is used - you can block and put restrictions on how your data’s used, if it’s inaccurate or unnecessary
say no - you can stop direct marketing and data processing when there’s no ‘compelling reason’ to do it
make changes to your data - you can update any data about you that’s out of date or false, without delay
human-made decision making - you can stop automated decisions being made about you, if it has legal or significant consequences
we aim to respond to your request within one month. we can take up to 3 months to respond if your request is complex. we’ll contact you within the first month to let you know if it’s going to take longer than one month.
we cannot respond to requests made by online portals unless we’re able to verify your identity.
contact our data protection team to use any of these rights.
dvsa data protection
dataprotection@dvsa.gov.uk
freedom of information and environmental information regulations
when you request information under freedom of information rules or the environmental information regulations, we may need to consult with other departments to give you a coordinated response.
if your request should have been sent to another organisation, we’ll reply and tell you who to send it to. we will not send your request to the other organisation for you.
sometimes we need to share your request for information with other organisations who help us run our services. we will not share any information that identifies you unless it is necessary to do so.
we keep a record of your request for 2 years. we only keep it for longer if it’s necessary because of an ongoing issue.
forms
if you fill in an online or paper application form, there will usually be a separate privacy notice with the form.
where a privacy notice has not yet been added to the form, we still follow all the rules and processes set out in this personal information charter to keep your personal data safe and secure.
emails and letters
when you write to us, we’ll use your personal data to look into the issue you’ve raised and send you a reply.
we usually keep a record of your email or letter for 2 years. we do keep some for longer if the service or system has a policy that says it has to be kept for longer.
if your email or letter is about something another government department or agency is responsible for, we will usually pass it to them to reply to you or tell you where to send it.
telephone calls
if you phone our customer service centre, we record the call for monitoring and training purposes, and to improve customer experience in the future.
we keep call recordings for one year. we may keep a recording for longer if needed, for example as part of an ongoing complaint or investigation.
distribution lists
we keep a number of distribution lists to communicate with our stakeholders as part of our functions as a government agency, where you have given your consent or for legitimate interests.
each list is only used for the purpose that the individuals on the list were told about at the time we collected their information or that you gave your consent for.
we provide an email alert service that lets you choose what updates to get. you can manage your preferences and subscribe at any time.
there’s a separate privacy notice for this service.
research
to design services that are easy to use and valued by the people who need them, we need to understand their circumstances, influences and expectations. research helps us understand this and whether the changes we make improve road safety.
the nature of the research determines what personal data is collected about you. when the research project has finished, we remove or anonymise all personal data from the records.
we publish the results of research on gov.uk, but we make sure you cannot be identified in it.
when we do a research project, you’ll be told about its purpose, what personal data we collect about you, if it will be shared with any other organisation and if it will be combined with other data.
we will:
ask for your consent to be part of a research project
tell you which lawful bases we’re relying on for our research, for example, public task or consent
email research2@dvsa.gov.uk if you do not want to take part in research, or if you originally said you wanted to, but have changed your mind and want to stop.
if we do not carry out the research directly ourselves, we’ll share your personal data with research companies we have a contract with to do research for us.
when we share your data
we may share personal data within our organisation or with other bodies where we are permitted to do so by law.
there are some cases where we can pass on your data without telling you - for example, to prevent or detect crime, or in order to produce anonymised statistics.
in all cases, whether data is shared internally or externally, we will be governed by data protection law.
public records
a small proportion of our records are transferred to the national archives, in line with legal obligations for the collection, disposal and preservation of records.
the public records act sets out which records are selected, transferred and preserved. records defined as ‘public records’ must be openly accessible, unless they’re exempt under the freedom of information act.
children’s privacy protection
our services are not designed for, or intentionally targeted at, children 13 years of age or younger. we do not intentionally collect or maintain data about anyone under the age of 13.
what we do to keep your data safe and secure
when we introduce new technology or new policies and processes, we consider your privacy from the start. we’ll carry out a data protection impact assessment (dpia) when it will help.
we always carry out a dpia when we:
use new technologies
consider there is a high risk to your rights and freedoms
if a risk is found and we cannot find a way to reduce the impact or likelihood of the risk happening, we’ll ask the department for transport (as the department that oversees us) and the information commissioner for advice.
you can request a copy of any dpia we’ve carried out by emailing pia@dvsa.gov.uk.
how we keep your data secure
we protect your personal data from unauthorised access, accidental loss, destruction and damage.
we carry out regular reviews and audits to make sure the way we collect, use and store personal data meets government security standards.
we also arrange for it health checks and penetration testing to be carried out on our systems. this is done by independent check approved individuals. these people:
have a contract with us
may have access to your personal data
must follow our policy on the acceptable use of it and communications equipment - they agree to do this before they carry out any work
we only transfer your personal data overseas if there are appropriate safeguards in place to protect it.
we will test changes to our systems using dummy data. where this is not possible, we will look at other options. if the only option is to test using your personal data, we shall:
ensure the system has had an it health check and any risks have been identified and addressed to a tolerable level
seek approval from relevant senior staff within dvsa
only test with the minimum amount of your personal data
only use dvsa staff or contracted supplier staff to test with live data and consider whether they need enhanced security clearance before doing so
securely remove your data from testing as soon as it has been completed
training and guidance we give to our staff
we train all our staff about the importance of protecting personal and other sensitive data.
anyone who routinely accesses personal data as part of their job has to do more in-depth training. anyone with access to large volumes of personal data has to carry out training tailored to their role.
our managers with formal responsibility for large datasets take extra training. this makes sure they have a clear understanding of what they need to do to keep the data under their control safe and secure.
all civil servants have to follow the civil service code. this has 4 core values of integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality. these values apply to how we handle personal data.
data breach notification
we do everything we can to keep your personal data secure.
we’ll tell the information commissioner’s office straight away (and always within 72 hours) if we become aware of a data breach. we’ll do this if the breach creates a risk to your rights and freedoms, including:
financial loss
breach of confidentiality
discrimination
damage to your reputation
significant social or economic damage
we’ll tell you straight away if we think there’s a high risk to you. we will:
give you our data protection manager’s contact details
explain the likely consequences of the breach
tell you what measures we’ve taken or plan to address the breach, including any steps taken to limit potential damaging effects
if we cannot contact you directly, we’ll try to make you aware through other means, such as a public announcement.
complain about how we’ve handled your data
if you believe your data has been misused, you can write to our data protection manager to complain about the way we’ve handled your personal data.

email information.handling@dvsa.gov.uk
we’ll send you a full response within 10 working days. if we cannot respond fully in that time, we’ll tell you why and let you know when we can respond in full.
contact dvsa customer services if you have a query that is not about how your personal data is used.
if you want to complain about our response
complain to the information commissioner if you’re not happy with the way we responded to your complaint about how we handled your data. they provide independent advice about data protection, privacy and data sharing issues.
privacy notices for our services and activities
each of our services and activities has a privacy notice. it tells you:
what personal data is collected, used and stored
how long the data is stored for
why the personal data is collected
how the personal data is used including who it’ll be shared with, if applicable
whether your data will be transferred or accessed outside of the uk, and what legal protection it will have, if applicable
most of our online services have a privacy notice link at the bottom of the service’s pages. you can use it to read the privacy notice for that service.
if an online service does not yet have a privacy notice link at the bottom of its pages, you can find it on the list of dvsa privacy notices.
you can also find privacy notices for our other activities on the list of dvsa privacy notices.

what we do
we are the uk’s tax, payments and customs authority, and we have a vital purpose: we collect the money that pays for the uk’s public services and help families and individuals with targeted financial support.
we do this by being impartial and increasingly effective and efficient in our administration. we help the honest majority to get their tax right and make it hard for the dishonest minority to cheat the system.
hmrc is a non-ministerial department, supported by 2 agencies and public bodies.

tendering for contracts and transparency
to comply with government regulations we use an approach based on the value of the contract, and whether a public-sector contract already exists that can be used:
we use 3 systems to advertise and to manage our contracts:
framework contracts awarded by crown commercial services or other procurement hubs for utilisation by the wider public sector government procurement service website
new procurement opportunities with a cumulative value of over £10,000 contracts finder website
new higher-value procurement opportunities with a cumulative total over the current eu threshold tender electronic daily website
all public-sector procurements are subject to european commission (ec) treaty principles of non-discrimination, equal treatment and transparency.
nda will publish all contract awards over £20,000 on contracts finder website.
to register and place bids for live procurements please visit the atamis eprocurement system.
general terms and conditions of contract
all suppliers of goods and services to the nda should familiarise themselves with our terms and conditions.

intellectual property policy
for our own nda operations (not tier 1, 2 and 3 contracts), we operate a strict “no purchase order, no pay” policy. you’ll need to reference your purchase order number. your primary procurement contact should be able to supply this if you do not already have it.
revisions to payment terms
nda recognises that prompt payment is a key issue for suppliers, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (smes).
the nda estate sme steering groups raised concerns about certain common commercial issues and barriers. they identified payment terms as one of the issues that needed to be tackled. the issue arises not with the site licence companies (slcs) per se, but further down the supply chain, where there are examples of 90-day or 120-day payment terms being demanded.
such long payment terms are not acceptable. terms such as ‘pay when paid’ are also not acceptable. nda has decided therefore to introduce a mandatory payment flowdown to the slcs’ terms and conditions, applicable to all new sub-contracts and sub-sub contracts through the supply chain, including new call-off from existing frameworks.
site licence company (slc) payment terms are generally nett monthly – the payment flowdown will therefore require that this is the maximum payment term allowable, but does not prevent shorter terms being agreed.

sme action plan
the government has set a target for 33% of central government spend to go to small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) by 2022. we are committed to supporting this target and look to ensure a fair and equal opportunity for all to bid for our contracts.
we also encourage our larger suppliers to consider smes within their sub-contracting opportunities directly and indirectly through the supply chain. all government departments have an sme action plan to support this aspiration. nda has its own action plan: nda sme action plan 2019 to 2022

the supply chain charter for nuclear decommissioning sites aims to foster good working relations across the nda group’s supply chain.

we employ a diverse range of talented people capable of delivering to a high standard, often under pressure and sometimes in difficult places. we want the modern fco to reflect the very best of 21st century britain and encourage applications from all suitably qualified applicants irrespective of background or circumstances. our diversity and equality report 2016 includes data on the equality impact of the foreign office’s employment practices and activities.
in return, we guarantee a fascinating, personally rewarding career at the centre of world events. we regularly score highly in surveys of ‘employers graduates would most like to work for’. the civil service has been in the top 10 of the times top 100 graduate employers over the last decade and moved up to 2nd place in the times top 100 graduate employers 2017 to 2018.
our staff
the fco employs around 13,000 staff around the world. roughly a third is made up of uk-based british civil servants whose careers typically include work in the uk and postings overseas; and around two thirds are employed locally by our british diplomatic missions overseas (such as an embassy, high commission, or consulate). applicants for these roles should be based in that country and usually need to be able to work in the main local language. for information on our local staff vacancies, please visit the web page for the country you are interested in working in.
we aim to recruit a diverse workforce - talented people, capable of delivering to a high standard, often under pressure and sometimes in challenging environments. we also offer maternity, adoption or shared parental leave of up to 26 weeks full pay followed by 13 weeks of statutory pay and a further 13 weeks unpaid, and paternity leave of 2 weeks full pay. to learn more about our work, and what you could do, follow us on twitter, facebook or linkedin. to find jobs at the fco, visit the civil service jobs website.
recruitment
recruitment into the fco’s uk-based workforce is normally either as a generalist into the diplomatic or home civil service cadres where staff rotate between a variety of roles, including overseas, or as a specialist (taking up a specific role requiring specialist skills, such as research analysts, lawyers).
all appointments to the fco are made in strict accordance with the key recruitment principles of the civil service commission.
the civil service-wide recruitment freeze introduced in may 2010 limits new appointments to frontline and business-critical jobs only. this has generally restricted fco generalist recruitment permitted under the freeze to the diplomatic service fast stream. we also participate in a number of other fast stream schemes including:
government economic service fast stream
goverment communication service fast stream
digital data technology service fast stream
finance fast stream
commercial fast stream
human resources fast stream
apprenticeships
in contributing to the government’s goal of 3 million apprenticeships by 2020, the fco is committed to developing our apprenticeship programme. in 2018 to 2019, we have recruited apprentices in business administration, communications, human resources, finance (accountancy) and commercial procurement. we recruit apprentices via our own external recruitment and via the government communication service schemes.
current vacancies
all our vacancies are published on the civil service jobs website and can be found by using the ‘organisation’ search engine on the website. we encourage you to visit this site regularly and set up vacancy alerts so that you do not miss our opportunities.
work experience
the fco aims to recruit a talented and diverse workforce which reflects the society we serve. in order to generate interest in fco careers from a broader applicant base, we offer a range of work experience opportunities each year. we hope that by giving individuals from a range of backgrounds the opportunity to sample working at the fco they may consider the fco as a future employer, as well as gaining beneficial work experience.
undertaking work experience or internship with us does not in any way guarantee future employment with the fco or offer any preferential treatment in the selection processes. our recruitment for permanent employment is merit-based in strict accordance with the key recruitment principles of the civil service commission.
we regret that the graduate internship scheme has been cancelled for 2020, due to the unprecedented impact of coronavirus (covid-19) on our operations. we still expect to launch our 2021 scheme next year in the spring. details will be published on this page nearer the time.
alongside our own graduate internship, we offer placements under schemes run by other government departments such as:
civil service fast stream (for graduates)
summer diversity internship programme (for ethnic minority students, disabled students and those from under-represented socio-economic backgrounds)
the application windows for each of the government schemes vary, so you should check the relevant website for further details.
in order to ensure our opportunities are accessible to all those who are eligible, we do not offer any work experience opportunities to individuals on an ad-hoc basis. we do not have the resources to acknowledge or respond to speculative applications.
our work experience opportunities, which are paid, are mainly focused on attracting individuals from backgrounds that are currently under-represented in our workforce, and on those who bring skills which we require to achieve our objectives. all work experience placements are awarded strictly on merit, after a competitive application process.
you can also follow us on twitter, facebook, linked in or sign up to our rss feeds.
international secondments
the uk supports international efforts to prevent violent conflict, to resolve existing conflicts, and to build peace in post-conflict situations.
in support of this, the fco seconds civilian experts and police (serving and retired officers) to international missions run by the european union (eu), united nations (un) and organisation for security and cooperation in europe (osce).
find out more about international secondments with the fco, for serving and retired police, and civilian experts.

what we do
we are the uk’s tax, payments and customs authority, and we have a vital purpose: we collect the money that pays for the uk’s public services and help families and individuals with targeted financial support.
we do this by being impartial and increasingly effective and efficient in our administration. we help the honest majority to get their tax right and make it hard for the dishonest minority to cheat the system.
hmrc is a non-ministerial department, supported by 2 agencies and public bodies.

how we process your personal data
uk procurement law
we must follow uk laws that govern how we may buy goods, services and works over a specified value or ‘threshold’.
where we expect the estimated value of a contract to be over the relevant threshold, we must advertise our requirements on the find a tender service (fts).
the procurement thresholds are published by the cabinet office.
transforming public procurement (tpp)
in december 2020, the cabinet office published the green paper ‘transforming public procurement’ which set out significant reforms aimed at speeding up and simplifying public procurement. the development and implementation of these reforms is owned and managed by the cabinet office.
the transforming public procurement programme aims to improve the way public procurement is regulated in order to:
c​reate a simpler and more flexible, commercial system that better meets our country’s needs while remaining compliant with our international obligations
open up public procurement to new entrants such as small businesses and social enterprises so that they can compete for and win more public contracts
embed transparency throughout the commercial lifecycle so that the spending of taxpayers’ money can be properly scrutinised
the procurement bill, which will reform the existing procurement rules, has now received royal assent. you can view the new procurement act on the uk legislation website, and the official record of the bill’s progress through parliament, with all supporting documents on the parliamentary website.
visit the designated tpp page to find out more about how public procurement will change to improve the way supplies, services and works are procured for the public sector.
latest contracting opportunities
we, and our executive agencies, advertise new contracting opportunities in the following places, where appropriate:
the uk e-notification service, find a tender (fts)
dfe’s research page
contracts finder
specialist publications, and trade, national and local press

forthcoming opportunities
we use a variety of means to notify suppliers of future opportunities, including:
advertising prior information notices (pin) on the fts website
publishing notices on contracts finder
publishing opportunities to tender on jaggaer
department for education commercial pipeline data: 2020 to 2021
duns numbers
‘duns numbers’ provide us with valuable information about which suppliers are bidding for our contracts. we encourage interested suppliers to register with duns numbers.
prompt payment policy
we follow government policy and pay all correctly submitted invoices within 10 days of receiving them at the physical or electronic address that we’ve specified.
educational and children’s social care professionals dynamic purchasing system (ecsc dps)
the education and children’s social care dynamic purchasing system (ecsc dps) has moved to the jaggaer commercial platform.
we use the ecsc dps to buy professional, educational and children’s social care services to support government policy in schools and local authorities.
if you would like to apply to join the ecsc dps, you can do so by logging in or registering on the jaggaer portal.
as a potential supplier you should register with jaggaer and apply to join the ecsc dps so that you can:
apply to become a member of the ecsc dps
view ecsc dps opportunities to tender
submit ecsc dps tender responses
prior to 22 december 2020, the dfe used redimo2 to host the ecsc dps. all ecsc dps members who gained approval prior to the 22 december 2020 will be migrated to jaggaer with their membership status retained.
further information on how this will be managed and any action required has been issued directly to existing members.
for any queries, please email the commercial contact point team.
commercial contact point team
email commercial.contactpoint@education.gov.uk
terms and conditions for using the ecsc dps

standard terms and conditions for dfe contracts
if you would like to know which terms and conditions apply when bidding for a particular dfe contract, contact the person named in the advertisement and tender documentation.
generally, we use the cabinet office short form, mid-tier and model services contract terms and conditions which are regularly updated. we may augment these terms with a small number of dfe specific terms and conditions.
where buying from a framework we use the corresponding crown commercial service framework terms and conditions. again, we may augment these terms with a small number of dfe specific terms and conditions.
purchase orders
our purchase orders (documents that ask a company to supply goods and give details of price, method and date of payment) are subject to our terms and conditions for goods (pdf, 148 kb, 8 pages).
key performance indicators (kpis) for government’s most important contracts
you can now view a list of central government’s most important contracts, showing up to 4 relevant key performance indicators (kpis) for those contracts, and the performance of the vendor against those kpis.
small and medium enterprises (smes)
our aim is to maximise opportunities for smes to participate in our procurement opportunities, by encouraging competition and reducing barriers to participation wherever possible.
we encourage smes to work with us directly or as part of the supply chain by:
having a tender process that treats smes fairly and by trying to keep our tender documents simple
supporting commercial relationships between the department and smes and smes and larger organisations
monitoring our sme spend and reporting to cabinet office for publication
opportunities for smes
we advertise new opportunities on contracts finder.
we also run innovation days where suppliers can meet each other and showcase what they offer. we advertise these on linkedin and twitter.

our sme action plan outlines how dfe is procuring and working with smes. the plan covers:
how we procure and support smes
the progress made so far

social value
we implement procurement best practice by focusing on achieving value for money, transparency and seek to treat all contractors (including smes) fairly and equitably and recognise the important contribution that small businesses can make to the delivery of our organisational objectives and strategies. see ukaea’s supply chain charter for more information about our approach to procurement, and our social value charter for how we aim to generate additional benefits from our procurements.
social value is of great importance to ukaea and we have been developing processes to ensure the importance is represented throughout ukaea’s staff and culture. by reaching out to the supply chain, we have begun devising metrics that can successfully be met by the wider supply chain as part of our procurement procedures. as part of this project, we have published a social value dashboard capturing the key findings of our data collection. you can view the anonymised results here: ukaea social value dashboard, february 2022 (pdf, 3.16 mb, 1 page)
the goal of fusion research is to provide a low carbon energy source for the second half of this century. whilst on the path to sustainable fusion energy, we aim to make our progress as environmentally friendly as possible. ukaea takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously and ensures all statutory obligations relating to waste management and discharges to the environment are strictly complied with.
early in 2021, the ukaea executive committee reviewed and approved our first sustainability strategy document. ukaea is committed to contributing to long-term environmental sustainability. it is this ambition that forms the focus of this strategy, together with the ways in which we are planning to achieve that. this document outlines the main sustainability aspects related to ukaea’s operations as well as our plans for addressing these and the rationale behind the adopted approach. more information on our sustainability goals and performance can be found in our annual report and accounts for 2021/22.
our modern slavery statement for the financial year 22/23 outlines our due diligence and how we are mitigating the risk of modern slavery. we encourage our suppliers to read our statement to understand ukaea’s policies in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking.
opportunities
our external spend is in excess of £100 million per year and covers a wide range of opportunities for suppliers.
ukaea manages and posts opportunities through eu supply to the platforms contracts finder and find a tender. contracts finder is a one-stop-shop for suppliers to identify contract opportunities. for opportunities above eu procurement thresholds, we advertise on find a tender.
expressions of interest, requests to participate or enquiries, where applicable, should be submitted directly to the procurement representative named in the advertisement who is responsible for that package of work.
selection questionnaires (sqs) will be clearly stated within the procurement advertisements and will require submission of information about competencies, qualifications, organisation and relevant experience for the particular project advertised.
ukaea is an executive non-departmental public body and operates in accordance with uk government policy. it is essential that a valid purchase order is in place before commencement of any works, supplies or services for, or on behalf of ukaea. failure to operate in accordance with this requirement will restrict enablement of payment. in effect no order no payment. please see managing public money for more information.
due to the actions of the russian government, with immediate effect, ukaea will not be conducting any procurement, commercial, business development or supply chain activity with any russian entity. this includes any goods or services originating from a russian source, even if not necessarily the main contractor. when conducting business with ukaea, the supply chain should confirm they are wholly aligned with this policy.
the uk stands with ukraine; russia’s assault on ukraine is an unprovoked, premeditated attack against a sovereign democratic state. the uk and our international partners stand united in condemning the russian government’s reprehensible actions, which are an egregious violation of international law and the un charter.
procurement pipeline
ukaea’s procurement pipeline is reviewed and published every quarter and outlines probable, upcoming procurement opportunities with relevant details such as the responsible procurement officer who can be contacted for more information.
note that information may be subject to change.
routes to market
we use a number of methods to purchase goods and services. the approach taken will depend on the contract value, type of product/service, the complexity of the requirement and the duration of the agreement
low value off the shelf purchases (current threshold <£20,000) – a simple purchase order with terms and conditions is issued for low value purchases. see ukaea standard purchase order conditions (pdf, 319 kb, 8 pages) for more information
opportunities – contracts are set up following a competitive tender exercise or single supply contracts are set up in exceptional circumstances. tender exercises are published as opportunities on the cabinet office contracts finder or find a tender portals
collaborative supply agreements – we use the government negotiated collaborative agreements wherever possible, and place contracts through the government procurement service portal
framework agreements – a framework agreement is an arrangement where terms, conditions and often pricing are agreed with a supplier(s) for a set period, which then allows orders to be placed quickly without a full tender being completed. a tender exercise is undertaken to set the framework up in the first instance
procurement during covid-19
towards the end of 2021, ukaea adopted a hybrid approach to working where possible. at both our culham and rotherham sites, the majority of our office based employees are working under the hybrid model whilst operational teams have remained full time to support delivery of our key operational programmes. this approach has been effective with continuing in-person collaboration and teamworking. ukaea has continued to monitor the impact of covid-19 on the supply chain. summaries from previous data collection can be found below.
ukaea supply chain - covid-19 summary update, august 2020 (pdf, 3.46 mb, 1 page)
ukaea supply chain - covid-19 summary update, february 2021 (pdf, 2.39 mb, 1 page)
ukaea is actively supporting the supply chain but if you have any questions, please email our procurement team at procurement@ukaea.uk.
supplier events
ukaea have a suite of events held throughout the calendar year to continue engaging with the supply chain and providing regular updates. these are held at three levels: ukaea-wide, programme-specific and tender-specific.
for general ukaea updates, we have developed an annual structure of suppliers events that we will host focusing on various aspects of ukaea activities.
spring: executive overview
summer: programme & project overview
winter: procurement overview
we have been looking into regular programme specific events to update suppliers who are keen to get involved with particular projects and activities. in september 2021, we began our step partnering forum series and will continue these as well as considering other ukaea programmes offering tailored events.
lastly, ukaea host regular pre-market engagement activities and industry days linked with specific itts and projects. the primary aim is to ensure potential suppliers fully understand the requirements of tenders or to retrieve feedback from the relevant experts and develop innovative solutions. to ensure the supply chain is kept up to date with our supplier events and industry days, there is an option to join our supplier mailing list. to find potential collaborators, consider registering to our industry directory and linkedin supplier’s network group. suppliers can also check our procurement portals for information on market engagement activities.
supply chain newsletter
ukaea’s supply chain newsletter is published quarterly to provide updates on the organisation and its supply chain activities.
see our most recent publishing here: supply chain newsletter, november 2023.
information and links for all previous editions can all be found in our supply chain newsletter archive.

who we are
we employ around 17,000 staff and operate from locations in england, wales, scotland and northern ireland.
our responsibilities
through the courts and tribunals we give people and businesses access to justice, including:
victims and witnesses of crime
defendants accused of crimes
consumers in debt or with other disputes
people involved in the adoption or protection of children
businesses involved in commercial disputes
individuals asserting their employment rights or challenging the decisions of government bodies
people affected by relationship breakdown
we follow the ministry of justice’s strategic vision for reform, to create a more effective, less costly and more responsive justice system for the public.
we’re responsible for:
providing the supporting administration for a fair, efficient and accessible courts and tribunal system
supporting an independent judiciary in the administration of justice
driving improvements across all aspects of the administration of the courts and tribunals
collaborating effectively with other justice organisations and agencies, including the legal professions, to improve access to justice
working with government departments and agencies to improve the quality and timeliness of their decision-making, which will reduce the number of cases coming before courts and tribunals
we launched our £1bn reform programme in 2016. four years on, and working closely with the wider judiciary, legal professionals and users of our justice system – are making considerable progress towards making that long-term vision a reality.
our reform programme page contains more information and updates from each of the jurisdictional areas.

how we treat your complaints
when we receive a complaint, we immediately refer it to an appropriate staff member who will then carry out an investigation.
we will reply in writing, or by telephone, within 15 working days from when we receive your complaint. if it is not possible for us to fully respond to you within this time, we will let you know and tell you what we are doing to deal with your complaint, when you can expect the full reply and from whom.
we will always acknowledge where things could have been done better and tell you what we will do to avoid the same thing happening again. equally, if we don’t agree with your complaint, we will let you know why.
what to do if you aren’t satisfied
the full reply to your complaint will include details of who to contact next if you think we have not dealt with it properly. this will normally be an appropriate senior departmental official.
that is the final stage of review for any complaint within dfe but, if you are still unhappy, you can refer your complaint to the parliamentary and health service ombudsman through your local mp.
our customer service standards

give you a response from the person best placed to answer your questions or provide the advice you need
be as polite, clear and helpful as possible
encourage you to give us feedback on our service so we can improve it
however we cannot respond to complainants who use obscenities, racist or homophobic language, or who are personally offensive about members of our staff.
questions we can’t help with
the procedure explained here is not for complaints about particular government policies. if you have a complaint about a policy, you can contact the minister for that policy, or alternatively contact your local mp.
complain about a school or an academy

all local authorities must set up a complaints procedure. contact your local authority directly to find out how to make a complaint.

does not review oia decisions
complain about a skills bootcamps course
learners and employers who want to complain about a course should contact their training providers. all skills bootcamp training providers must have a complaints procedure.
if you feel your complaint has been handled poorly, or the training provider has unduly delayed their response, you can complain about the handling of your complaint.
we will need the following information:
the name of the skills bootcamp course and training provider
the details of your complaint, including key dates
a copy of the original complaint sent to the training provider
if available, a copy of the letter or email from the training provider setting out the final response to your appeal
permission to disclose details of your complaint to the training provider

contact your local council if you think a child or young person is at risk or is being abused or neglected

if you work in an early years or educational setting, or a children’s social care service, and are concerned about suspected wrongdoing, you should follow the institution’s process for ‘blowing the whistle’.
if you are a professional with concerns about how child protection issues are being handled in your organisation, or another organisation, you should contact the national child abuse whistleblowing advice line on 0800 028 0285 or help@nspcc.org.uk.
all local-authority-maintained schools should set up a whistleblowing procedure.
report fraud
if you believe there is fraud or financial wrongdoing at an organisation we fund email full details, including the name of the organisation, to fraud.reports@education.gov.uk.
we will investigate cases where there is enough evidence.

how accessible are our statistics
we are committed to making our statistical outputs accessible. we have reviewed our statistical outputs and for the large majority of our statistical series, the most recent publication includes accessible versions of all outputs, in line with the public sector bodies (websites and mobile applications) accessibility regulations 2018 (the “accessibility regulations”) . there are a small number of statistical series where the elements of the latest release are not fully accessible. in particular, some of our spreadsheets may not be clearly structured with labelled tables, and labelled headings. columns headings may be blank. workbooks tabs may not have a clear title. this does not meet success criterion 1.3.1 (info and relationships) .
we are working on these remaining series and will ensure that accessible versions of the latest releases are available by the end of 2022 at the latest.
in accordance with the accessibility regulations, we have assessed the impact of making all statistics published between 23 september 2018 and 23 september 2020 fully accessible. this was deemed to be a disproportionate burden for the following reasons:
beis published around 350 statistical publications in the period 23 september 2018 to 22 september 2020. the majority of these publications are not fully accessible. making all publications fully accessible would have large resource implications, which would significantly impact on our ability to meet the current statistical needs of our users.
users of routine regular statistics bulletins should only access the most recently published iteration, which may include revisions, methodological improvements and changes, and incorporates retrospection. the latest iteration thus generally supersedes all earlier iterations.
google analytics evidence demonstrates that usage is high for the most recent iteration only, falling to negligible levels after the release of subsequent iterations, so actual usage does not support a need to proactively reproduce earlier iterations. for ad hoc releases the same trend is observed, indicating ad hocs are of primary interest close to the time of release, and this interest does not persist.
in line with the accessibility regulations, we will provide a specific statistical publication in a different format if requested.
the equality and human rights commission (in great britain) and the equality commission for northern ireland (in northern ireland) are responsible for enforcing the accessibility regulations. if you are unsatisfied with your response from beis, you may contact the equality advisory and support service or the equality commission for northern ireland.
corporate procedures and standards

mission & goals
ukaea’s mission is to lead the delivery of sustainable fusion energy and maximise the scientific and economic benefit.
the five interconnected strategic goals to deliver on this mission are:
solve challenges of sustainable fusion energy - from design through to decommissioning - with world-leading science and engineering.
enable partners to design, deliver, and operate commercial fusion power plants.
drive uk economic growth and a thriving industry that exports fusion technology around the world.
create clusters that accelerate innovation in fusion and related technologies.
develop the talented, diverse people needed to deliver fusion energy.
fusion, the process that powers the sun, can play a big part in our low-carbon energy future. ukaea manages the uk fusion programme. our scientists and engineers are working with partners around the globe to develop fusion as a new source of sustainable energy for tomorrow’s power stations. ukaea’s research can be accessed at the ukaea scientific publications site.
our activities
ukaea has hosted the jet (joint european torus) facility at culham since its design started in 1973. first operation was in 1983 and since then it has set world records for fusion performance. jet is normally run and
funded as a joint facility with eurofusion. as the uk is not currently associated to euratom (and by extension eurofusion) eurofusion is not currently funding jet. as a result, ukaea has continued to fund full jet running costs to maintain the world class science done at this facility. the mast upgrade facility, also based at culham, is leading the world in research into compact fusion devices.
new facilities linked to our fusion research are now operational at culham and at a fusion technology centre near rotherham, south yorkshire.
materials research facility (mrf), is a new uk facility for micro-characterisation of materials now open to university and industry users. it is part of the national nuclear user facility initiative.
remote applications in challenging environments facility (race) is conducting r&d and commercial activities in the field of robotics and autonomous systems.
fusion technology facilities at culham and rotherham are sparking the solutions to key challenges in developing fusion power plants.
the hydrogen-3 advanced technology (h3at) centre is researching fuel technology for fusion power; in particular, tritium - one of the two main fuels needed for commercial fusion.
oxfordshire advanced skills (oas) is a training centre enabling oxfordshire business to offer young people hi-tech and engineering apprenticeships of the highest quality.
building on this broad and extensive fusion research and technology programme, ukaea is now embarking on the design of a uk fusion power station - the spherical tokamak for energy production, known as step. an initial concept design phase for step has started, with the ultimate aim of producing net electricity from fusion around 2040.
in addition, we are responsible for several pension schemes, and own land at the harwell campus and culham science centre sites in oxfordshire, and are committed to further develop these thriving science, technology and business parks.
history of the uk atomic energy authority
early years
the uk atomic energy authority (ukaea) was formed in 1954 when the british government set up a new body to oversee the nation’s nuclear research programme. the role was to provide britain’s atomic weapons deterrent and develop reactor technologies for the nuclear power stations of the future.
early achievements included the opening of the world’s first full-scale nuclear power station at calder hall - which led to the construction of ten further magnox stations - and the dounreay fast reactor, which went critical in 1959.
ukaea was also exploring the potential of fusion energy, and opened a purpose-built fusion laboratory at culham in 1960.
diversification
from 1965, ukaea branched out into commercial and non-nuclear activities to take advantage of spin-off potential from nuclear technology. the atomic research programme also continued, with ukaea leading plans for new reactor types including advanced gas-cooled reactors and fast reactors.
a reorganisation of the uk’s civil nuclear industry in the early 1970s saw changes to ukaea’s structure and role. the transfer of responsibilities in weapons research, fuel production, isotope production and radiological protection to other organisations allowed us to focus on our research mission.
commercial activities continued to grow across the sites, with harwell alone generating £50 million per year from over 1,200 contracts by 1985. they covered a diverse range of areas, from space tribology to petroleum services and reactor safety testing. aea technology was formed in 1989 to act as the ukaea’s commercial arm, and was eventually privatised in 1996.
decommissioning
the civil nuclear programme ended with the closure of the prototype fast reactor at dounreay in 1994. ukaea had already turned its attention to a new task - that of restoring the environment of its sites as reactors finished operating. since then we have made extensive progress, and in 2005 we safely dismantled our fifteenth reactor - zebra - at winfrith.
in april 2005 the nuclear decommissioning authority (nda) was formed to take responsibility for the uk’s civil nuclear clean-up programme. ukaea became a contractor to the nda for management of decommissioning at dounreay, harwell, windscale, winfrith and the jet facilities at culham. also in 2005, the government approved the authority’s plans to expand and compete for wider business.
in april 2008, ukaea limited was formed as a commercial arm, subsidiary company dounreay site restoration limited (dsrl) was licensed by the nii, and the windscale site was merged into the newly licensed sellafield limited. this was followed in february 2009 by the licensing of subsidiary company research sites restoration limited (rsrl), covering the harwell and winfrith sites.
following a sale process announced by government in march 2009, ukaea limited, together with its subsidiary companies dsrl and rsrl, were sold to babcock international group plc on 31st october 2009. the remaining ukaea organisation then focused on fusion energy research at culham.

do you want to help shape the future of the world’s energy? we are recruiting to a wide range of scientific, engineering and technical posts to enable us to meet the growing demands of our challenging european and uk fusion energy programmes.
we have professionally accredited training schemes for graduates and apprentices, and strong links with universities around the uk for phd placements.
we can offer a wide range of employee benefits including excellent professional development and mentoring programmes, a final salary pension scheme, bonus scheme, flexible working, and relocation expenses.
you can find career opportunities and job vacancies at ukaea on the ukaea careers website.
benefits
annual leave
the annual leave entitlement for employees is 25 days (pro rata for part-time employees) rising to 28 days after five years of service and then to 30 days after ten years of service. in addition employees are entitled to 10.5 days holiday (including bank holidays and privilege days). employees work a revised working week to cover the days that fall between christmas and new year when the site is closed. this means that no annual leave needs to be saved to cover these days. employees are able to carry over up to ten days of annual leave to the next leave year, if they wish. there is also the opportunity to accrue time off in lieu of extra work carried out as overtime, instead of receiving a payment, subject to line manager’s discretion.
pension
employees of ukaea are automatically enrolled into the ukaea combined pension scheme (cps), which is a final salary defined benefit scheme. it includes the following benefits for members:
a pension and lump sum payment at normal pension age of 60. the pension is based on final salary and calculated as: years’ service x pensionable final earnings x 1/80th. the lump sum is: 3 x the annual pension;
options at retirement to convert lump sum into additional pension or to commute pension to additional lump sum;
options for early retirement or partial retirement;
death in service benefits including lump sum of 2 x pensionable final earnings and spouse and dependents pensions;
spouse and dependents pensions on death after retirement;
ill health benefits of payment of pension and lump sum with possible enhancement;
additional voluntary contributions scheme.
employee contributions qualify for tax relief and the ukaea also contributes. some benefits are reduced for service less than 2 years. employees can opt out of the scheme. further details of the scheme can be found at the following website: ukaea pension scheme
note: the cps is expected to close for future accrual of benefits at some point in the future as part of the reform of all public sector pensions, and most ukaea employees and all new employees will then be transferred to the civil servants and others pension scheme (known as alpha) for future benefits. this is a career average revalued earnings (care) defined benefits scheme. it includes very similar benefits to the cps, but the pension is built up each year based on 2.32% of salary and inflation each year. further details of the alpha scheme can be found at the following website: alpha pension scheme
benefits earned in the cps at the date of the change to the alpha arrangement will be frozen and when paid will be based on service to the date of joining the alpha scheme and pensionable final earnings when the member leaves the alpha scheme or leave employment (whichever is earlier) i.e. the link to final salary for cps benefits is maintained.
bonus scheme
employees are normally entitled to bonus payments depending on corporate performance in any given financial year. milestones are set up in a way so that employees’ performance has influence on performance in a given area. bonus payments are paid on an annual basis as a percentage of salary (maximum 7%).
relocation
new entrants who are required to move their home to take up a permanent appointment may, at line manager’s discretion, be given some assistance towards their removal expenses. this is subject to a ceiling of £8,000.
flexible working
all roles are open to job sharing unless otherwise stated.
part-time working
we are proud to promote working part-time to enable employees to maintain a healthy life-work balance. depending on the business needs, this can range from shortened days to allow for ‘the school run’ to shortened weeks to fit with life style choices and most ports between.
emergency family leave (time off for dependants)
at discretion a member of staff can request time off work to deal with an emergency involving a dependant. this leave is to allow employees to deal with unexpected or sudden problems and to make longer term arrangements as necessary. there is no qualifying period necessary for this leave and depending on circumstances some of the time off may qualify to be paid.
maternity leave
where an employee qualifies for contractual maternity pay (at least one year’s effective service), she will receive her normal rate of pay during the 26 week ordinary maternity leave period.
following this the first 13 weeks of additional maternity leave will be paid at the appropriate rate of smp. the remaining 13 weeks of additional maternity leave will be unpaid.
adoption leave and paternity leave schemes are also offered.
wider benefits
core values
we prides itself on being a great place to work and is committed to the continual development of our people. the core values are pioneering, excellence and innovation and these are at the heart of the management development programme which fosters development and in so doing grows our organisation to meet current and future needs.
there is a friendly and collaborative atmosphere at culham. ideas and results are openly shared meetings and there are opportunity to hear from external scientific speakers – both from the international fusion community and the wider scientific world.
learning and development
we are committed to developing all members of staff by offering a wide range of programmes and support to suit their individual career aspiration. in engineering these range from an advanced apprenticeship scheme certified by imeche and iet, and a graduate scheme also certified by imeche and iet with iop pending. we are similarly accredited for our continuous professional development schemes and are members of the iet power academy. in physics we offer phd and msc opportunities, and culham fellowships. in addition to the structured development schemes we also provide individual development as needed by the business and career trajectories.
mentoring scheme
to help support its staff through their careers and professional development, we have introduced a mentoring programme. mentoring is a relationship in which one person, the mentor, helps another, the mentee, to discover more about themselves, their potential and capability. it can assist an individual by enabling them to seek guidance, support, help and feedback. the mentoring programme is a formal process which will be regularly reviewed and monitored. it recognises that individuals have different goals and aspirations and it endeavours to meet the individual’s requirements and needs as well as those of the organisation.
athena swan
we support the principles of athena swan and have been awarded the bronze award. this is in recognition of the commitment we have made to advancing women’s careers in stem areas.
cycle to work scheme
cyclescheme provides employees with the opportunity to purchase a new bike through a salary sacrifice scheme. employees are entitled to borrow up to £1,000 for a bike and accessories.
parking facilities
excellent parking facilities are available across the site. parking spaces located close to offices and free of charge. the site is monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
health and wellbeing
research has shown that healthy and happy staff contribute more to their employer as well as the nation as a whole. as part of our health and wellbeing programme, we provide a range of free benefits helping to further improve your health and wellbeing. there is an on-site occupational health service. there is also an employee assistance programme which is a welfare initiative, available to all staff, by telephone, giving support and counselling, covering a wide variety of subject areas, such as financial, personal, work-related and legal.
eating and drinking
at culham we have catering outlets such as shops, a sandwich bar and a restaurant offering a great range of food and drinks for staff to choose from throughout the day. the majority of the food is made in-house.
there is also a costa coffee outlet offering fresh coffee and cakes.
social clubs and events
there is a social club (cssa) which organises discounted theatre trips to various london theatres for its members, as well as supporting a wide range of clubs and societies. in addition cssa organises a range of events on site such as christmas parties for kids, bonfire nights and other events. this winter, colleagues have been challenged to a winter triathlon which includes a pub-style quiz, a skittles match and traditional aunt sally contest. last year the senior management team issued a softball challenge, 23 teams of 10 players responded playing in a league and knockout stages. the final was played at a staff fun day where 1,100 employees, contractors and their families enjoyed a wide range of free events, music and a traditional hog roast.
health, safety and environment
good safety, health and environmental management is an integral part of the efficient management of ukaea. the high standards of safety, health, and environmental protection needed to undertake world-class research at ukaea are only achieved through the vigorous commitment of everyone, including top management, to continual improvement. our goal is, therefore, to cause no harm to people, property or the environment.
in commitment to proper safety, health and environmental management, we will:
ensure compliance with all legal obligations and any other systems or standards ukaea chooses to comply with;
require that all those who work for us to conform with the requirements of the ukaea safety, health and environment management system;
provide healthy and safe workplaces with safe equipment and safe procedures of work;
commit to preventing pollution and the protection of the environment through responsible utilisation of resources, particularly in relation to energy usage and management of waste;
integrate safety, health and environmental considerations into all aspects of the organisation;
though the annual assurance improvement programme set and annually review safety, health, and environmental objectives and targets to assess and improve safety, health and environmental performance and report that performance openly;
implement inherently safer and cleaner technologies, processes and procedures;
create a safe, healthy and environmentally responsible working culture;
this policy is implemented through the arrangements defined in the ukaea management systems manual and associated procedures, is communicated to all within the organisation and available to external interested parties. the policy will be reviewed annually and, where necessary, proposals made for its improvement.
each individual employee within ukaea is responsible for upholding this policy in their area of work and for taking action to maintain standards.

quality assurance framework
our social research aims to provide high-quality evidence to inform policy development and delivery.
research following children and young people of the 2020s
we’re running a new programme of research to understand the lives of children and young people growing up in the 2020s. the studies will provide vital insights into the wellbeing and education outcomes of children and young people in the key phases of education, from early years to post-16.
the following studies are being conducted on behalf of dfe and are underway.
children of the 2020s - ipsos is conducting the study between 2022 and 2027, following children’s learning and development from age 9 months to 5 years.
five to twelve - the national centre for social research (natcen) is conducting the study from 2023 until 2029, following children and their families from year 1 to year 6. if you have been contacted about participating in the study, send enquiries to fivetotwelve@natcen.ac.uk or freephone 0800 652 4568, monday to friday 9am to 5pm.
areas of research interest
dfe’s areas of research interest sets out the topics we would like to engage external researchers with. we expect to release further areas of research prompted by the challenges posed by coronavirus (covid-19) shortly.
dfe data for research
read our guidance on accessing dfe data extracts from the national pupil database (npd), school workforce, individualised learner record and higher education statistics agency.
research projects
routes to market for social and economic research
all new projects are being procured via 2 crown commercial service dynamic purchasing systems:
low value purchase system - provides public sector buyers with a new route to market for their below threshold common goods and services (under £120,000)
research and insights marketplace - enables central government and the wider public sector to commission social, market and economic research expertise and services
if you want to be invited to tender for research commissioned by dfe, you should register as a supplier on both systems.
registration is free and there is no limit to the number of suppliers who can join.
jaggaer: the dfe e-tendering portal
jaggaer is an e-tendering system used by dfe and its executive agencies. it is a password-protected online service.
as a potential supplier, you should register with jaggaer so that you can:
view opportunities to tender
submit tender responses
for help with registration, use the support links on the jaggaer portal.
publications
use the style guide and template to write your research publications.
you can find our research reports published since may 2010 in gov.uk’s publications section.
research published before may 2010 is available from the uk government web archive.
quality assurance framework
the framework sets out a standardised approach to quality assurance to ensure that analysis is:
fit for purpose
reliable
accurate
transparent
accountable

how we process your personal data
uk procurement law
we must follow uk laws that govern how we may buy goods, services and works over a specified value or ‘threshold’.
where we expect the estimated value of a contract to be over the relevant threshold, we must advertise our requirements on the find a tender service (fts).
the procurement thresholds are published by the cabinet office.
transforming public procurement (tpp)
in december 2020, the cabinet office published the green paper ‘transforming public procurement’ which set out significant reforms aimed at speeding up and simplifying public procurement. the development and implementation of these reforms is owned and managed by the cabinet office.
the transforming public procurement programme aims to improve the way public procurement is regulated in order to:
c​reate a simpler and more flexible, commercial system that better meets our country’s needs while remaining compliant with our international obligations
open up public procurement to new entrants such as small businesses and social enterprises so that they can compete for and win more public contracts
embed transparency throughout the commercial lifecycle so that the spending of taxpayers’ money can be properly scrutinised
the procurement bill, which will reform the existing procurement rules, has now received royal assent. you can view the new procurement act on the uk legislation website, and the official record of the bill’s progress through parliament, with all supporting documents on the parliamentary website.
visit the designated tpp page to find out more about how public procurement will change to improve the way supplies, services and works are procured for the public sector.
latest contracting opportunities
we, and our executive agencies, advertise new contracting opportunities in the following places, where appropriate:

prompt payment policy
we follow government policy and pay all correctly submitted invoices within 10 days of receiving them at the physical or electronic address that we’ve specified.
educational and children’s social care professionals dynamic purchasing system (ecsc dps)

further information on how this will be managed and any action required has been issued directly to existing members.

generally, we use the cabinet office short form, mid-tier and model services contract terms and conditions which are regularly updated. we may augment these terms with a small number of dfe specific terms and conditions.

upcoming statistical releases
the release timetable
dfid makes every effort to release its national statistics as soon as possible and in an orderly manner in line with the code of practice for statistics. we publish official statistics on provisional and final uk aid spending normally in spring and autumn in statistics on international development. we also release figures for gross public expenditure on international development after sid.
the timing of these releases is largely determined by the timetable for reporting uk oda figures to the oecd, when the office for national statistics make the latest gni estimates available, and the timing for processing and quality assuring the spending data from dfid, other government departments and other oda contributors.

if you need to speak to a member of the team urgently, please send us an email requesting a call back – please include your contact number and a brief explanation of your query. a member of the team will contact you as soon as possible. please note we cannot help you with a court or tribunal case, investigate a judicial office holder or say whether their actions amount to misconduct.

our commitment
natural england is committed to contributing to the achievement of a strong, healthy and just society. we promote personal well-being, social cohesion and inclusion, and creating equal opportunity for people in existing and future communities.
what we are doing
natural england’s equality and diversity policies and procedures comply with the law and any duties required of public sector organisations. we ensure they are practiced in ways which foster an inclusive work and service environment where each person feels respected, valued and understood, whatever their diversity.
we use equality impact assessments (eqias) as a tool to ensure that equality, social inclusion and community cohesion issues are considered when drawing up policies or proposals which affect the delivery of services, development of policies or the running of projects. eqias help to measure whether policies will have a negative, neutral, or positive effect on different communities, and to identify potential improvements to services. for an example see recruitment selection (pdf, 168 kb, 5 pages).
equality and diversity data
natural england monitors and publishes information on its workforce's protected characteristics (pdf, 887 kb, 39 pages): age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation. this helps us to:
understand the potential impact of our policies, practices and services on our people
identify the priority areas where we need to focus our attention
contact
if you have any questions about diversity and inclusion at natural england, please email enquiries@naturalengland.org.uk.

overview
at natural england, science, evidence and analysis are at the heart of our advice, operations and regulatory activity.
to achieve our vision of thriving nature for people and planet, we need to understand:
what changes are occurring in the natural environment
what interventions and actions work well
our science, evidence and evaluation strategy sets out how we will achieve our ambition to be an evidence-led organisation. we work in partnership, across ecological, economic and social sciences to underpin our actions and decisions with robust data and evidence.
our science, evidence and analytical capability continues to grow. 79% of our staff are linked with one or more civil service professions. over a quarter of our staff have professional membership of one or more industry professional bodies.
our chief scientist, dr tim hill, takes the lead on this work.
our annual chief scientist report explains how we use evidence in nature’s recovery.
our natural england action plan also sets out our current priorities.
investing in science and evidence
natural england’s science and evidence portfolio oversees the evidence needs of the organisation. it delivers projects through a combination of in-house expertise, collaborative work with partners, grants and external contracts. examples include:
the natural capital ecosystem assessment programme
refining dna-based methods for monitoring, assessing and managing the environment - for example the application of edna techniques in mapping great crested newt populations
delivering nature-based solutions for climate change at the landscape scale programme
preparation of a state of natural capital report and embedding natural capital evidence in our work
read our publications in our access to evidence catalogue.
supporting strategic research and innovation
building partnerships for nature’s recovery is natural england’s mission. there are many ways to work in partnership with us, from informal arrangements to more formalised partnership agreements.
we also support a range of studentships and internships each year, working with a wide range of universities and research institutes. our national nature reserves research portal has information about suggested topics for dissertation projects based on our national nature reserves.
to look to the future, natural england utilises horizon scanning, systems thinking and innovation to consider emerging issues. we worked closely with the government office for science to shape the futures toolkit which we use in practice to direct our futures thinking.
using our evidence
high quality science, data and evidence underpin the advice we provide on the natural environment.
we continue to improve and develop new and existing projects. this means our best available evidence can be applied to decision making by investing in:
modernising and updating our digital and data systems
delivering environmental research, monitoring and analysis
evolving technologies including earth observation and data science techniques
evaluating our work
you can find out more about some of our environmental monitoring activities and how we apply new technologies on our natural england blog. this covers projects such as our people and nature survey (pans), and the creation of a national scale habitat map from satellite imagery and field observations.
you can use natural england’s data and derived evidence products or statistics in your work or study.
we have published our core principles and ways of working with data and evidence as a set of standards.
evaluating our work
we are committed to evaluating and learning from our projects, programmes, and delivery. we do this to understand what works for people and the natural environment, in line with formal government guidance set out in the magenta book. evaluation is a critical part of being an evidence-led organisation, in line with our science evidence and evaluation strategy.
we are keen to work with the wider sector to address the challenges of how we:
evaluate and learn from our projects and programmes
can innovate and build knowledge about what works for nature recovery

about us
the attorney general's office (ago) provides legal advice and support to the attorney general and the solicitor general (the law officers) who give legal advice to government. the ago helps the law officers perform other duties in the public interest, such as looking at sentences which may be too low.
attorney
general's
office
responsibilities
the attorney general’s office (ago) is a ministerial department which supports the attorney general and the solicitor general (the law officers). the law officers are government ministers who:
provide legal advice to government
superintend, or oversee, the main independent prosecuting departments - the crown prosecution service and the serious fraud office
superintend, or oversee, her majesty’s cps inspectorate, which inspects how cases are prosecuted
superintend, or oversee, the government legal department, which provides legal services to government
answer questions about their work in parliament
perform other functions in the public interest, such as looking at sentences which may be too low - these duties are independent of government
neither we nor the law officers can provide legal advice to members of the public or business.
consider unduly lenient (low) sentences
if a sentence given in a crown court appears to be very low, or unduly lenient, anyone can ask the attorney general to examine the sentence, within 28 days of sentencing.
the attorney or solicitor general may then ask the court of appeal to look at the sentence. the court may decide to keep the sentence the same, increase it, or issue guidance for future cases.
you can also follow the progress of referrals made to the attorney general’s office.
examine cases of contempt of court
contempt of court is where inappropriate reporting risks making a trial unfair or where someone does not respect a court or disrupts its work by words or actions.
the attorney general can take legal action in the public interest if certain types of contempt of court have been committed.
deal with vexatious litigants
people who keep bringing unnecessary court cases can be classed as vexatious litigants. the attorney general can apply to the high court to designate someone as a vexatious litigant by getting a court order to prevent them from issuing proceedings without agreement from the court.
inquests
an inquest is a limited, fact-finding inquiry into an unexpected death. it is intended to establish who has died, and how, when and where the death occurred.
if somebody connected to the dead person thinks the inquest did not come to the correct conclusion, for example if new evidence emerges, they can ask the attorney to consider asking the high court to look at the evidence again. she will do this if she thinks a new inquest is necessary. she cannot order a new inquest herself.
the attorney does this as part of her public interest role, independently of government and strictly on the basis of the evidence.
charity law
the attorney can help the courts when considering cases involving charities. she can also ask the charity tribunal to clarify any matter of charity law.
consents to prosecute
a few serious offences need the consent of the attorney general before somebody can be charged. prosecutors must first decide whether there is enough evidence for a charge.
the attorney general is not involved in the vast majority of individual cases in england and wales.
legal guidance on consents to prosecute
appointing specialist lawyers to act for the government

dcms commercial pipeline
terms & conditions
dcms is a very small, policy-orientated department. contracts and purchasing are organised centrally within the department. our arm’s length bodies undertake their own contracts and purchasing activity. the majority of our central support services are outsourced to other government organisations, including our core information technology requirements. we do not keep preferred supplier lists.
the commercial team can be contacted by email: commercial@dcms.gov.uk
public procurement (eu) regulations
as with other government departments and many other public bodies, dcms is obliged to follow the relevant public procurement regulations. the most recent regulations applicable are the public contracts regulations 2015.
these regulations set value thresholds for contracts, above which certain procedures must be applied to the tendering and award of contract. for dcms, these thresholds are presently set at:
goods - £106,047
services - £106,047
works - £4,104,394
the regulations set out rules relating to advertising the requirement by way of a notice in the official journal of the european union (ojeu) including:
the manner in which tenders may be sought
minimum timescales for tendering
the criteria which may and may not be applied to the selection of tenderers, and
the contractor and technical specifications that may be applied
procurement policy
we are fully committed to government policy on procurement as set out in guidance from the cabinet office under the crown commercial services (ccs).
this has 2 basic objectives:
to achieve continuing improvement in value for money based on whole-life cost and quality
to enhance the competitiveness of suppliers through the development of procurement systems and practices
we are also committed to developing the use of e-procurement as a way of improving efficiency.
our procurement strategy
wherever possible and cost effective we make use of central framework arrangements set up by crown commercial service or by other government departments.
where a suitable framework agreement is not available:
multiple quotations are sought for requirements with an estimated value between £5,000 to £10,000 (ex vat)
requirements with an estimated value of more than £10,000 (ex vat) will be advertised via contracts finder, where applicable
requirements with an estimated value of more than £100,000 (ex vat) will be advertised via the official journal of the european union (ojeu), where applicable
all requirements go through the commercial team.
while individual tendering procedures will be tailored to the specific needs of the contract there are some general principles that we seek to apply:
specifications will focus on the required output
all tenderers will have the same chance and be treated fairly and equally
tender documents will be clear and easy to understand
over specification will be avoided
client contractor relationship
in all dealings with dcms, officials will seek to preserve the highest standards of integrity, objectivity, fairness, efficiency and professionalism. in turn, we expect contractors to meet these same standards.
ethics in procurement require high standards of conduct which ensure that the probity of officials and the propriety of their actions is above question. this means that:
all dealings with officials should be fair and even-handed
all of our contracts contain provisions relating to corrupt gifts
sustainable procurement
we are committed to adopting good environmental practice. while always ensuring best value for money, procurement can play a vital role in assisting green policy objectives.
some of the ways in which the department incorporates environmental factors into purchasing decisions are:
wherever possible, when specifying goods, ensuring that less environmentally damaging products are specified. a simple example would be when ordering furniture, any woods used should be from either a recycled wood products or from a sustainably grown sources
calculating the whole life cost of specifying an environmentally friendly product
under ec procurement directives, tenderers will not be excluded from bidding on non-economic grounds. tenderers can be excluded if they fail to meet specific green procurement requirements, but not because of other general environmental considerations.
tenders
evaluation of tenders
if you are tendering for a contract with dcms, you will be informed of the broad evaluation criteria used for assessing bids as part of the tender documentation. bids are usually assessed on the ‘most economically advantageous tender’ which includes both technical / quality and pricing factors.
all tenderers are assessed against the same criteria. this might involve you attending a presentation or interview where you can present your bid in more detail, or we can seek clarification. we award a contract as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.
unsuccessful tenders
within the limits of some commercial confidentiality, the department will always offer unsuccessful tenderers the reasons why their bid failed. such debriefing can be by phone or face to face.
this should be viewed as a 2-way process.
the comments from the department should be viewed as constructive. they are aimed at making unsuccessful tenderers aware of certain weaknesses and strengths and enabling them to better compete for future work.
dcms commercial pipeline
the dcms commercial pipeline can be viewed dcms commercial pipeline published march 2023 (pdf, 250 kb, 5 pages). the pipeline is an indicative 24 month forward look of potential commercial activity to be undertaken by the department but may be subject to change. all enquiries regarding the pipeline information should be sent to commercial@dcms.gov.uk.
terms & conditions
dcms use a suite of standard terms and conditions proportionate to the requirement, which are issued to potential tenderers as part of the tender documentation.
dcms issue purchase orders (pos) to support all contracts, as part of our purchase to pay (p2p) system.
where purchases are not supported by a specific written contract, the po includes dcms standard terms and conditions (pdf, 166 kb, 2 pages).
for any queries please contact commercial@dcms.gov.uk.

how accessible are our statistics
we are committed to making our statistical outputs accessible. we have reviewed our statistical outputs and for the large majority of our statistical series, the most recent publication includes accessible versions of all outputs, in line with the public sector bodies (websites and mobile applications) accessibility regulations 2018 (the “accessibility regulations”) . there are a small number of statistical series where the elements of the latest release are not fully accessible. in particular, some of our spreadsheets may not be clearly structured with labelled tables, and labelled headings. columns headings may be blank. workbooks tabs may not have a clear title. this does not meet success criterion 1.3.1 (info and relationships) .
we are working on these remaining series and will ensure that accessible versions of the latest releases are available by the end of 2022 at the latest.
in accordance with the accessibility regulations, we have assessed the impact of making all statistics published between 23 september 2018 and 23 september 2020 fully accessible. this was deemed to be a disproportionate burden for the following reasons:
beis published around 350 statistical publications in the period 23 september 2018 to 22 september 2020. the majority of these publications are not fully accessible. making all publications fully accessible would have large resource implications, which would significantly impact on our ability to meet the current statistical needs of our users.
users of routine regular statistics bulletins should only access the most recently published iteration, which may include revisions, methodological improvements and changes, and incorporates retrospection. the latest iteration thus generally supersedes all earlier iterations.
google analytics evidence demonstrates that usage is high for the most recent iteration only, falling to negligible levels after the release of subsequent iterations, so actual usage does not support a need to proactively reproduce earlier iterations. for ad hoc releases the same trend is observed, indicating ad hocs are of primary interest close to the time of release, and this interest does not persist.
in line with the accessibility regulations, we will provide a specific statistical publication in a different format if requested.
the equality and human rights commission (in great britain) and the equality commission for northern ireland (in northern ireland) are responsible for enforcing the accessibility regulations. if you are unsatisfied with your response from beis, you may contact the equality advisory and support service or the equality commission for northern ireland.
corporate procedures and standards
we produce national and official statistics in accordance with the guidance provided in the code of practice for statistics. details on how we do this are set out in the documents below.

quality assurance framework
our social research aims to provide high-quality evidence to inform policy development and delivery.
research following children and young people of the 2020s
we’re running a new programme of research to understand the lives of children and young people growing up in the 2020s. the studies will provide vital insights into the wellbeing and education outcomes of children and young people in the key phases of education, from early years to post-16.
the following studies are being conducted on behalf of dfe and are underway.
children of the 2020s - ipsos is conducting the study between 2022 and 2027, following children’s learning and development from age 9 months to 5 years.
five to twelve - the national centre for social research (natcen) is conducting the study from 2023 until 2029, following children and their families from year 1 to year 6. if you have been contacted about participating in the study, send enquiries to fivetotwelve@natcen.ac.uk or freephone 0800 652 4568, monday to friday 9am to 5pm.
areas of research interest
dfe’s areas of research interest sets out the topics we would like to engage external researchers with. we expect to release further areas of research prompted by the challenges posed by coronavirus (covid-19) shortly.
dfe data for research
read our guidance on accessing dfe data extracts from the national pupil database (npd), school workforce, individualised learner record and higher education statistics agency.
research projects
routes to market for social and economic research
all new projects are being procured via 2 crown commercial service dynamic purchasing systems:
low value purchase system - provides public sector buyers with a new route to market for their below threshold common goods and services (under £120,000)
research and insights marketplace - enables central government and the wider public sector to commission social, market and economic research expertise and services
if you want to be invited to tender for research commissioned by dfe, you should register as a supplier on both systems.
registration is free and there is no limit to the number of suppliers who can join.
jaggaer: the dfe e-tendering portal
jaggaer is an e-tendering system used by dfe and its executive agencies. it is a password-protected online service.
as a potential supplier, you should register with jaggaer so that you can:
view opportunities to tender
submit tender responses
for help with registration, use the support links on the jaggaer portal.
publications
use the style guide and template to write your research publications.
you can find our research reports published since may 2010 in gov.uk’s publications section.
research published before may 2010 is available from the uk government web archive.
quality assurance framework
the framework sets out a standardised approach to quality assurance to ensure that analysis is:
fit for purpose
reliable
accurate
transparent
accountable

overview
at natural england, science, evidence and analysis are at the heart of our advice, operations and regulatory activity.
to achieve our vision of thriving nature for people and planet, we need to understand:
what changes are occurring in the natural environment
what interventions and actions work well
our science, evidence and evaluation strategy sets out how we will achieve our ambition to be an evidence-led organisation. we work in partnership, across ecological, economic and social sciences to underpin our actions and decisions with robust data and evidence.
our science, evidence and analytical capability continues to grow. 79% of our staff are linked with one or more civil service professions. over a quarter of our staff have professional membership of one or more industry professional bodies.
our chief scientist, dr tim hill, takes the lead on this work.
our annual chief scientist report explains how we use evidence in nature’s recovery.
our natural england action plan also sets out our current priorities.
investing in science and evidence
natural england’s science and evidence portfolio oversees the evidence needs of the organisation. it delivers projects through a combination of in-house expertise, collaborative work with partners, grants and external contracts. examples include:
the natural capital ecosystem assessment programme
refining dna-based methods for monitoring, assessing and managing the environment - for example the application of edna techniques in mapping great crested newt populations
delivering nature-based solutions for climate change at the landscape scale programme
preparation of a state of natural capital report and embedding natural capital evidence in our work
read our publications in our access to evidence catalogue.
supporting strategic research and innovation
building partnerships for nature’s recovery is natural england’s mission. there are many ways to work in partnership with us, from informal arrangements to more formalised partnership agreements.
we also support a range of studentships and internships each year, working with a wide range of universities and research institutes. our national nature reserves research portal has information about suggested topics for dissertation projects based on our national nature reserves.
to look to the future, natural england utilises horizon scanning, systems thinking and innovation to consider emerging issues. we worked closely with the government office for science to shape the futures toolkit which we use in practice to direct our futures thinking.
using our evidence
high quality science, data and evidence underpin the advice we provide on the natural environment.
we continue to improve and develop new and existing projects. this means our best available evidence can be applied to decision making by investing in:
modernising and updating our digital and data systems
delivering environmental research, monitoring and analysis
evolving technologies including earth observation and data science techniques
evaluating our work
you can find out more about some of our environmental monitoring activities and how we apply new technologies on our natural england blog. this covers projects such as our people and nature survey (pans), and the creation of a national scale habitat map from satellite imagery and field observations.
you can use natural england’s data and derived evidence products or statistics in your work or study.
we have published our core principles and ways of working with data and evidence as a set of standards.
evaluating our work
we are committed to evaluating and learning from our projects, programmes, and delivery. we do this to understand what works for people and the natural environment, in line with formal government guidance set out in the magenta book. evaluation is a critical part of being an evidence-led organisation, in line with our science evidence and evaluation strategy.
we are keen to work with the wider sector to address the challenges of how we:
evaluate and learn from our projects and programmes
can innovate and build knowledge about what works for nature recovery

as one of the largest legal organisations in the united kingdom, we handle over 20,000 litigation cases each year, representing the government and public bodies in courts and tribunals. we have more than 1400 employees, 850 of whom are solicitors or barristers in our advisory, litigation and employment divisions.
our responsibilities
our responsibilities include:
advising ministers and policymakers on domestic, public and private law, european community law, international law and human rights
drafting statutory instruments and other subordinate legislation
preparing instructions for bills to be drafted by parliamentary counsel and advising ministers and policy administrators during the passage of the bill through parliament
carrying out legal work to support judicial reviews and new government initiatives
collecting, managing and disposing of bona vacantia (ownerless property and other assets) in england, wales and northern ireland, including:
the estates of persons who die intestate and with no entitled relatives
the assets of dissolved companies and failed trusts
advising the civil service on the modernisation of the terms and conditions of government employment
our priorities
our priorities for 2013 to 2014 include:
to supply the best quality legal services for our clients in government, while demonstrating best value for money for the taxpayer
to work with the government to build tsol into a shared legal service across government as part of the civil service reform plan
to improve our civil service people survey scores and ensure tsol is always a place where people wish to work and can thrive
to support the government’s pledge on alternative dispute resolution (adr) in all appropriate cases
bona vacantia
the latin term ‘bona vacantia’ literally means ‘vacant goods’ and is the legal name for ownerless property, which by law passes to the crown.
the treasury solicitor is the crown’s nominee for the purposes of the administration of the estates of persons who die intestate and without known kin and for the collection of the assets of dissolved companies and other miscellaneous bona vacantia in england and wales.
tsol deals with this through its bona vacantia division.

about us
we supervise the hallmarking activities of the 4 assay offices in the uk to ensure there is adequate provision of hallmarking within the uk.
contents
responsibilities
priorities
who we are
corporate information
responsibilities
we are responsible for:
working with the assay offices and trading standards to ensure that hallmarking law is enforced
creating regulations to help the assay offices (the official uk bodies who test the purity of precious metals) in their work and to help the uk jewellery trade grow
proposing legal changes and advising the secretary of state for business and trade
maintaining the high standards of the uk’s hallmarking facilities
monitoring the work of the uk assay offices and their established sub-offices (including any sub-offices offshore)
priorities
for 2022, our priorities are:
enterprise, promoting hallmarking as the guarantee of the integrity of the precious metals industry
improving the regulation of precious metals marketed online
encouraging risk-based and proportionate enforcement of hallmarking across trading standards
operational integrity
council members and chair, inductions, appraisals and recruitment
governance and administration, review in line with the framework document
read our corporate statement to find out how we are performing against our priorities.
who we are
the council
the assay offices appoint 6 members to the council:
2 from birmingham assay office
1 from edinburgh assay office
2 from london assay office
1 from sheffield assay office
see the membership page for details.
we may co-opt (elect people from outside the assay offices) up to 2 further members. such members are usually recommended by the edinburgh and sheffield assay offices. the assay masters (assay office chief executives) can’t be council members, but they have a right to attend and speak at meetings.
ten council members are appointed by the secretary of state. these members hold office for terms of 3 years.
we are funded entirely by the 4 uk assay offices who split the costs between them.
we normally meet twice a year where we receive a report from each assay office on its activities, and are supplied with statistical information which includes the number of articles assayed.
the assay offices
assay offices test the purity of precious metals, to protect consumers from buying fake items. if an item conforms with the legal requirements for purity, the assay office marks it with the appropriate hallmark. in the uk, a hallmark can only be applied by one of the 4 assay offices.
there are 4 assay offices in the uk:
birmingham assay office
edinburgh assay office
london assay office
sheffield assay office

overview
at natural england, science, evidence and analysis are at the heart of our advice, operations and regulatory activity.
to achieve our vision of thriving nature for people and planet, we need to understand:
what changes are occurring in the natural environment
what interventions and actions work well
our science, evidence and evaluation strategy sets out how we will achieve our ambition to be an evidence-led organisation. we work in partnership, across ecological, economic and social sciences to underpin our actions and decisions with robust data and evidence.
our science, evidence and analytical capability continues to grow. 79% of our staff are linked with one or more civil service professions. over a quarter of our staff have professional membership of one or more industry professional bodies.
our chief scientist, dr tim hill, takes the lead on this work.
our annual chief scientist report explains how we use evidence in nature’s recovery.
our natural england action plan also sets out our current priorities.
investing in science and evidence
natural england’s science and evidence portfolio oversees the evidence needs of the organisation. it delivers projects through a combination of in-house expertise, collaborative work with partners, grants and external contracts. examples include:
the natural capital ecosystem assessment programme
refining dna-based methods for monitoring, assessing and managing the environment - for example the application of edna techniques in mapping great crested newt populations
delivering nature-based solutions for climate change at the landscape scale programme
preparation of a state of natural capital report and embedding natural capital evidence in our work
read our publications in our access to evidence catalogue.
supporting strategic research and innovation
building partnerships for nature’s recovery is natural england’s mission. there are many ways to work in partnership with us, from informal arrangements to more formalised partnership agreements.
we also support a range of studentships and internships each year, working with a wide range of universities and research institutes. our national nature reserves research portal has information about suggested topics for dissertation projects based on our national nature reserves.
to look to the future, natural england utilises horizon scanning, systems thinking and innovation to consider emerging issues. we worked closely with the government office for science to shape the futures toolkit which we use in practice to direct our futures thinking.
using our evidence
high quality science, data and evidence underpin the advice we provide on the natural environment.
we continue to improve and develop new and existing projects. this means our best available evidence can be applied to decision making by investing in:
modernising and updating our digital and data systems
delivering environmental research, monitoring and analysis
evolving technologies including earth observation and data science techniques
evaluating our work
you can find out more about some of our environmental monitoring activities and how we apply new technologies on our natural england blog. this covers projects such as our people and nature survey (pans), and the creation of a national scale habitat map from satellite imagery and field observations.
you can use natural england’s data and derived evidence products or statistics in your work or study.
we have published our core principles and ways of working with data and evidence as a set of standards.
evaluating our work
we are committed to evaluating and learning from our projects, programmes, and delivery. we do this to understand what works for people and the natural environment, in line with formal government guidance set out in the magenta book. evaluation is a critical part of being an evidence-led organisation, in line with our science evidence and evaluation strategy.
we are keen to work with the wider sector to address the challenges of how we:
evaluate and learn from our projects and programmes
can innovate and build knowledge about what works for nature recovery

guidance on how to complain
before you make a complaint
contact the office you’ve been dealing with
ask for your complaint to go to a senior manager
wait for our final response
contact the independent case examiner
1. before you make a complaint
you can make a complaint if you’re unhappy with the service provided by dwp, for example if:
mistakes have been made
there were unreasonable delays
you feel you’ve been treated poorly
you haven’t been kept informed
a complaint is defined as any expression of dissatisfaction about the service provided which is not resolved by operational staff as normal business.
we will not investigate complaints:
about government policy or law
that have already been investigated or are currently being investigated by the independent case examiner or the parliamentary and health service ombudsman
that are, or have been, subject to legal proceedings, including legal settlements
challenge or appeal a benefit decision
you cannot make a complaint to challenge a benefit decision (this is known as a ‘mandatory reconsideration’) or appeal against a benefit decision, overpayment decision, child maintenance assessment or sanction.
read about how to request a mandatory reconsideration of a benefits decision.
if you disagree with the decision in a mandatory reconsideration notice, you can appeal to the social security and child support tribunal.
state pension age changes
at present, we are not investigating complaints about 1950s women and state pension age changes.
we stopped investigating these complaints on 30 november 2018 when the issue went before the high court. both the high court and the court of appeal have given judgment on this matter, in favour of the government. the supreme court refused permission to appeal but the claimants have 6 months from the date of that decision to appeal to the european court of human rights.
in the meantime, the parliamentary and health service ombudsman began an investigation. dwp will not investigate a matter that is being considered by the ombudsman.
if you have already complained to us, we will write again to inform you of the next steps.
we will continue to investigate complaints not related to state pension age changes under the normal dwp complaints procedure.
2. contact the office you’ve been dealing with
if you’d like to complain about any aspect of the service you’ve received, let the office you have been dealing with know as soon as possible.
you can contact them by phone, in person or in writing. universal credit claimants can also use their journal.
you need to let them know:
your national insurance number – unless you are an employer
your full name, address and contact numbers
which benefit you are complaining about
what happened, when it happened and how it affected you
what you want to happen to put things right
if we’ve made a mistake, we’ll put it right as soon as possible and apologise immediately. if you’ve experienced unfair treatment or suffered financially, we may consider making a special payment to you.
who to contact
use the contact details at the top of any recent letters we’ve sent you or the contact details below.
if you live in northern ireland, go to the department for communities website for more information.
to complain about an organisation that provides dwp services, for example employment programmes or health assessment providers, contact them directly. if you don’t agree with their response, they will tell you how to take things further.

our priority is to make sure customers continue to receive their payments and to process new benefit claims.
unfortunately, this may affect the delivery of some other services. this includes responding to complaints, which may take us longer than usual. in these exceptional circumstances, we ask anyone who has already submitted a complaint to be patient and we will respond to you as soon as we can.

you will receive a final response by telephone or letter from the dwp complaints team. this will tell you the outcome of your complaint, and how to contact the independent case examiner if you are not satisfied.
5. contact the independent case examiner
you must have had a final response from the dwp complaints team before you contact the independent case examiner.
if you’re not happy with the final response from the dwp complaints team, you can ask the independent case examiner to look at your complaint.
you must contact them within 6 months of getting the final response from the dwp. they may ask to see a copy of your final response, if you received it by letter.
