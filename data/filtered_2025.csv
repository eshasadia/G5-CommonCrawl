national citizen service
national citizen service
national citizen service has closed
the national citizen service trust worked to empower young people as part of the government’s national youth guarantee.
the national citizen service (ncs) was founded in 2009 and granted royal charter body status in 2018. it provided opportunities for 16 to 17 year olds in england to build confidence, develop key skills, and prepare for the world of work through residential trips, community-based projects, and online experiences. ncs delivered almost one and a half million experiences to young people, and through ncs, young people completed more than 18 million hours of volunteering and social action. over 80% of young people who took part in the ncs programme said they gained valuable skills for the future and 70% agreed that ncs fostered respect for diversity.
the national citizen service programme concluded on 31 march 2025 and the national citizen service trust will be closed in due course.
view the closed national citizen service site in the uk government web archive.
please note that the ncs trust website is no longer operational and social media is no longer monitored. these will shortly be closed down.

your rights and how to exercise them
how to request personal information
definitions of your other rights
under the uk general data protection regulation and the data protection act 2018, you have the right to request copies of your, or someone else’s with their specific written consent, personal data from organisations including government departments. the data protection laws give you rights over that data, including making sure it is correct, how it should be handled and when it should be deleted.
you can find full details of our obligations under the data protection laws in our information charter.
ministry of justice information charter (pdf, 210 kb, 6 pages)
y siarter gwybodaeth (pdf, 182 kb, 5 pages)
we are also working on ways to improve the process for anyone wanting to contact the moj about personal data.
your rights and how to exercise them
for your personal data, you have the right to:
request copies of your personal information we hold about you
be informed about what we do with your personal information
request rectification (correcting errors)
request erasure (in certain circumstances)
request to restrict processing
request data portability (in certain circumstances)
object (in certain circumstances)
not be subjected to automated decision-making, including profiling
we’ve set out below your rights and how to contact the moj for each of these rights.
the process for contacting us about the first right listed, the right to request copies of your personal information, is a different process than when contacting us about all the other rights.
right to request copies of your personal information
this is known as the ‘right of subject access’, and a request for a copy of your personal information is called a ‘subject access request’, or sar. we will only disclose personal information about you, not about anyone else.
if we do hold information about you, we will:
give you a description of it
tell you why we have it
provide the information in a readable format, subject to any exemptions contained in the legislation
any subject access request should ideally include 2 things:
a description of where your personal data may be held. tell us where in the department your personal data may be held. it will help us to find your records. for example, tell us which part of moj or prison you have had dealings with, including any relevant reference numbers and dates. please be as specific as possible.
valid identification.
moj has a responsibility to protect your data and keep it secure.
an important safeguard is verifying the identity of anyone who asks to have their personal data. this ensures that your data is kept secure, and that only you can access it through a sar.
in order to access your data, you will need to provide 2 pieces of id:
the first form of id should include a clear photo of you, such as from your passport or driving licence.
the second form of id should include your name and current address, such as on a utility bill, council tax bill, bank or credit card statement. your driving licence is acceptable as proof of your address if it is also accompanied by additional photo id (such as your passport). acceptable bills include electricity, gas, water, telephone/broadband, council tax, bank statement or credit card statement. any bill should be dated within the last 6 months.
we ask for photo id not to confirm likeness but because obtaining photo id involves a series of additional safeguards. we are satisfied that this is a necessary and proportionate safeguard to keep your data secure.
how to request personal information
you can make a subject access request for yourself, or on behalf of someone else, online.
access the request personal information service.
do not use this service to request information or documents from courts or tribunals (hmcts)
to request personal information that might have been recorded during a court or tribunal case, you must contact the relevant court or tribunal. they will be able to help explain what you need to do. if you make a request for this information using the request personal information service it is likely to be refused.
you can also make a request by email or post.
email: data.access@justice.gov.uk
by post:

how to request personal information from hm prison and probation service
if you want to make a subject access request (or if you are representing an offender, prisoner or former prisoner and want to make a subject access request on their behalf with their specific written consent) for a copy of personal information held by hm prison and probation service, you can make a request online.
access the request personal information service
you can also make a request by email or post.
email: data.access1@justice.gov.uk
by post:

make sure you include the id we need and provide enough detail to help us to trace the records. this should include the full name, date of birth, prison number and the name of the prison the prisoner is currently held in. if you are representing a former prisoner, please include the name of the last prison they were held in, along with the relevant dates.
ministry of justice staff requests for personal information
ministry of justice (moj) staff must refer to the intranet for details of how to make a subject access request.
privacy notice for employees, workers and contractors (pdf, 148 kb, 10 pages)
definitions of your other rights
right to rectification
if some information we hold about you is wrong or has changed, you have the right to have it corrected or updated.
right to erasure
in certain circumstances, if the personal data we hold about you is no longer needed, you have the right to have it deleted. this is also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’.
right to restrict processing
in certain circumstances, you have the right to restrict how your personal data is used. this may be due to the accuracy of the data, or if the data has been unlawfully processed, or moj no longer needs it but you would like us to keep it in.
right to data portability
we must send your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. this right only applies when you have consented to the processing of the data.
right to object
you have a right to object to the processing of your personal data, specifically if the data is:
for direct marketing purposes
a task carried out in the public interest
the exercise of official authority or legitimate interest
rights related to automated decision making including profiling
automated decision-making is a decision made about you by a machine, without humans being involved. profiling involves the use of personal data to group characteristics to try and predict future behaviour.
the moj can only carry out solely automated decision making if the decision is:
necessary for entering into or performance of a contract between you and moj
authorised by law
based on your explicit consent
how to exercise your other rights
to exercise any of your information access rights, that are not a request for a copy of your personal information from the ministry of justice, send your request:
email: dataprotection@justice.gov.uk
by post:
data protection team

hmrc is the uk’s tax, payments and customs authority, and we have a vital purpose: we collect the money that pays for the uk’s public services, and help families and individuals with targeted financial support.
we do this by being impartial and increasingly effective and efficient in our administration. we help the honest majority to get their tax right and make it hard for the dishonest minority to cheat the system.
hmrc is a non-ministerial department, supported by 2 agencies and public bodies.

what we buy
the department for work and pensions (dwp) is responsible for welfare, pensions and child maintenance policy. as the uk’s biggest public service department it administers the state pension and a range of working age, disability and ill health benefits to around 20 million claimants and customers.
as a result we procure a varied range of goods and services including, but not limited to, welfare to work and health provision, digital goods and services, resources, estates and facility management, contact centre services and training.
our procurement strategy
in common with other government departments, dwp procurements are conducted in line with the uk public contracts regulations and uk cabinet office guidelines and codes of practice, including those relating to transparency, open competition, equal opportunity and ensuring value for money.
refer to the sell goods or services to the public sector guidance for general information about tendering for public sector contracts.
the dwp commissioning strategy sets out the employment provision key themes which will define our relationship with providers and our overall approach right across the market place – from the largest programmes to smallest contracts.
code of practice
dwp follows an ethical approach to purchasing the range of goods and services needed to meet the requirements of our customers.
we are committed to public sector best practice. in all commercial activity dwp pursues the highest standards of professionalism, ethical conduct and impartiality. competitive processes are governed by uk legislation and conducted in accordance with the public procurement policy.
supplier code of conduct
the supplier code of conduct reiterates the government’s approach to acting together with trusted suppliers to deliver better public services.
the code exists to help suppliers understand the standards and behaviours that are expected of them when working with the government, and how they can help the government deliver value for money for taxpayers.
contract opportunities
unless they can be procured from an existing contract or framework agreement, dwp contractual opportunities are generally advertised and opened to an appropriate degree of competition unless there are compelling reasons why competition cannot be used.
the precise procurement route and degree of advertising will depend on the regulatory requirements, the nature of the goods and/or services being procured and the estimated full life value of the contract.
dwp contract opportunities, including tender timetables and tender documents can be found via the central digital platform and on the uk e-notification service find a tender.
find a tender replaced the eu’s tenders electronic daily from 1 january 2021 for high value contracts in the uk and has been rebranded as the central digital platform which will host all government procurement activity.
dwp also uses the cabinet office low value purchasing system. registration is free and there is no limit on the number of suppliers who can join this dps marketplace. you can register as a supplier on the supplier registration page.
flexible support fund dynamic purchasing system 2 (fsf dps 2)
flexible support fund dynamic purchasing system 2 (fsf dps 2) is the replacement to the dps for work-focused activities also known as the flexible support fund (fsf) dps. the previous fsf dps expired on 31 october 2021 and fsf dps 2 replaced it for new call-offs from 1 november 2021. this dps vehicle will end in 2028 - further information on a replacement will be shared nearer the time
to become accredited to deliver services under fsf dps 2 refer to the flexible support fund dynamic purchasing system 2 (dps) opportunity notices:
fsf dynamic purchasing system 2 – for the provision of work focused activities. project_23908 –contracts finder
fsf dynamic purchasing system 2 – for the provision of work focused activities. project_23908 – find a tender
find out more information about how to register and apply to the fsf dps on the dwp flexible support fund dynamic purchasing system 2 page.
welfare to work test and learn dynamic purchasing system
the welfare to work test and learn purchasing system presents opportunities for suppliers to apply for tender opportunities, with a focus on innovation and local specialist welfare to work support, and to support and test the development of new approaches for employment support.
find out how to register and apply for tender opportunities through the test and learn dynamic purchasing system.
low value provision opportunities
low value provision (lvp) provides opportunities for relevant training that will help claimants into work, where no other suitable dwp contracted or non-contracted training is available.
to bid for and supply lvp opportunities you need to complete an online application form.
esourcing portal
important changes to the dwp esourcing portal
dwp uses an esourcing portal to electronically transact it’s end to end procurements and contract management, accessed via the internet.
it provides an efficient, simple, security accredited and compliant means for managing tendering activities, reducing the time and effort required for both buyers and suppliers.
the esourcing portal enables users to:
register and express an interest in a procurement opportunity
participate in tendering activities, downloading, completing and submitting proposals
conduct in life management activities during the contract period
in september 2025 we will change our esourcing portal currently provided by jaggaer to our new contractor atamis.
please read the important transition and new instructions below.
from friday the 22 august 2025 you will no longer be able to access jaggaer for dwp esourcing activity, including messages. if your organisation is currently involved in live procurement or contract management activity you should have received a detailed communication from your commercial contacts about next steps.
if you did not have any correspondence, please contact the commercial systems excellence team mailbox: cdp-i.systemsanddata@dwp.gov.uk.
dwp is migrating data from it’s existing esourcing portal to the new so you will not be required to resubmit any information or documents, and transition will be carried out as seamlessly as possible.
the new esourcing portal goes live on the 5 september 2025.
you must register on the new esourcing portal, atamis to continue to transact with dwp.
you can do this from 5 september by accessing the link below, guidance is also accessible via the help with registration link.
register to use atamis.
help with registration.
if you wish to be a potential supplier to dwp and would like to participate in future opportunities, we recommend you also register for the new esourcing portal now.
all future government opportunities subject to find a tender service publication will only be accessible through the new esourcing portal.
see separate information on registering on the central digital platform which is now a mandatory requirement to tender for public procurement.
procurement transparency
the government has set out the need for greater transparency across its operations to enable the public to hold public bodies and politicians to account. this includes commitments relating to public expenditure, intended to help achieve better value for money.
as part of the transparency agenda, the government has made the following commitments with regard to procurement and contracting:
all new central government tender documents for contracts over £12,000 to be published on the find a tender website
all new central government contracts over £12,000 to be published on the find a tender website
new items of central government spending over £25,000 to be published online at www.data.gov.uk
suppliers and those organisations looking to bid for public sector contracts should be aware that if they are awarded a new government contract, the resulting contract between the supplier and government will be published. in some circumstances, limited redactions will be made to some contracts before they are published in order to comply with existing law and for the protection of national security and personal privacy.
the dwp commercial pipeline provides a forward look of our anticipated outsourcing activity over the forthcoming 18 months and where possible those activities we reasonably expect to undertake in the next 3 to 5 years. the pipeline includes all our major projects and anticipated procurements valued at £10 million or more.
spend data
monthly data for the dwp on payments of £25,000 and above made to suppliers, grantees and other recipients is published.
transactions may be redacted for reasons of national security or personal privacy.
the data is freely available at www.data.gov.uk.
key performance indicators (kpis) for government’s most important contracts
you can now view a list of central government’s most important contracts, showing up to 4 relevant key performance indicators (kpis) for those contracts, and the performance of the vendor against those kpis.
opportunities for small and medium enterprises (smes)
the government recognises the important role of new businesses, entrepreneurs, start-ups, small and medium-sized enterprises (smes), voluntary, community and social enterprises (vcses) and mutuals in delivering against the government’s industrial and civil society strategies.
where feasible, dwp also wants to trade with smes to support economic growth and sustainability within this important business sector.
in the dwp, we support and encourage a diverse range of suppliers to bid for departmental contracts and we monitor the level of business smes receive from us directly (by winning contracts) or indirectly (by winning contracts with prime contractors or further down supply chains).
the small business hub provides support for smes on bidding for government contracts.
find out more about bidding for government contracts.
read the dwp sme action plan to find out more about how we work with smes.
crown representative for smes and vcses
in addition to the crown representatives for government’s strategic suppliers, there is a crown representative whose focus is removing barriers to smes across government.
there is also a crown representative who champions the role that voluntary, community, and social enterprises (vcses) can play in delivering public services. vcses: a guide to working with government provides support for vcses on bidding for government contracts.
dwp will take all steps it can to welcome and facilitate bids from these sectors either directly or as part of a group.
duns number
duns are a globally recognised way of identifying suppliers. a unique duns number is required by all government departments.
to improve the experience of dealing with dwp and in support of on-boarding new suppliers, dwp requires all suppliers to provide their duns number.
if you don’t have a duns number you can use this form to get your dun & bradstreet (d-u-n-s) number. this is a free process and should take no more than 5-10 minutes.
the duns number ensures dwp maintain a consistent and standardised database of suppliers that are being transacted with. this requirement also supports dwp’s commitment to the government digital agenda.
terms and conditions
the dwp contracts with its suppliers using standard terms and conditions, for example terms and conditions based on the model services contract for high value complex services over £10,000.
suppliers should always refer to the specific terms and conditions issued as part of a procurement tender exercise.
the dwp general terms and conditions (ps1 and ps2) are applied to low value and low risk requirements below £10,000.
the public sector contract (psc) core terms and conditions are used for contracts called off the crown commercial service (css) framework agreements. the core terms are ccs’s standard commercial terms. they govern the supplier’s relationship with ccs and every buyer who has a call-off contract. these opportunities are advertised through existing crown commercial service (ccs) framework agreements. you would need to be accepted onto the framework to hear about them. to access these agreements you need to register on the ccs esourcing tool.
diversity and equality
all contractors and sub-contractors must be aware of dwp’s commitment to equality and diversity including the public sector equality duty (psed).
the public sector equality duty applies across great britain to public bodies listed in schedule 19 to the equality act 2010 and to other organisations when they are carrying out public functions. this will mean for dwp that those organisations which carry out and provide services on our behalf are required to comply with the legislation
find out more about dwps commitment to providing services which embrace diversity and that promote equality of opportunity.
contractors expenses policy
dwp will reimburse necessary and reasonable business travel and accommodation costs incurred whilst undertaking duties on behalf of dwp and delivering requirements to dwp, where this is agreed as part of the contractual terms.
find out about dwp policy on expenses for business travel and accommodation for contractors, interim managers and consultants.
welfare to work - dwp employment category provider guidance
the dwp employment category provider guidance gives information about the role of organisations contracted to deliver welfare to work provision for dwp.
the provider referrals and payments system (prap) enables secure, automated exchanges of information about customers referred to providers, and payments from dwp to prime providers. all welfare to work contracted provision is supported by prap.
prompt payment to suppliers
dwp recognises that regular cashflow is important for suppliers to effectively deliver the terms of their contracts and are fully supportive of the central government requirement for departments to pay 90% of undisputed invoices within 5 days. suppliers need to be aware of the correct procedures involved to achieve this.
dwp operates a ‘no purchase order, no pay’ policy, which applies to suppliers and contractors who provide goods, services and works to the department.
this explains:
why dwp has introduced this policy
who the policy covers
how dwp will provide purchase orders
what to include in an invoice
when you’ll be paid
invoices without purchase orders will not be paid.
full details and guidance can be found on the dwp procurement: no purchase order, no pay policy page.
prompt payment to sub-contractors
where the supplier lets a subcontract in connection with a dwp contract, they must include similar prompt payment terms to the above in respect of payments to the subcontractor. suppliers are now required to pay the sub-contractor invoices within 30 days.
to report non-compliance with this requirement sub-contractors should provide details by email to dwp.
include the nature of your contract with the dwp supplier and, where possible, details of the suppliers’ contract with dwp, to: subcontractors.questions@dwp.gov.uk.
read the prompt payment data for dwp.
data protection and information security
dwp takes data protection and information security very seriously and is required to give assurance that personal data is being appropriately protected throughout its supply chain.
read about data protection and information security for dwp suppliers and contractors.
sustainable procurement
sustainable procurement is a process whereby organisations meet their needs for goods, services, works and utilities in a way that achieves value for money and generates benefits not only to dwp, but also to society and the economy too, while minimising damage to the environment.
dwp is committed to supporting sustainable procurement.
bidders for our major contracts (current threshold £5million) now have to demonstrate they have carbon reduction plans in place to achieve the government target of achieving net zero by 2050.
contracts may also contain the requirement for our suppliers to develop a sustainable development plan to demonstrate commitment to overarching sustainably requirements during the life of the contract.
to support its aims the department seeks to minimise its own environmental impact and reports its progress against targets on the greening government commitments (ggc) page.
government buying standards
dwp adheres to the national procurement policy statement - gov.uk and all policies will be updated in line with the current policies.
the government buying standards (gbs) are a set of sustainable specifications for a range of commonly purchased products. read the latest information about how dwp and its suppliers are responding to the gbs.
social value in procurement
dwp adheres to the public services (social value) act which requires departments who procure services to consider social, economic and environmental benefits in procurements. this means we utilise our procurement and contract management activities to deliver additional value that benefits our citizens, communities or the environment.
since the introduction of ppn06/20 taking account of social value, our approach is to include specific social value (sv) criteria by default to all contracts exceeding £120k. using the sv model, inclusion of specific sv value criteria supports the government sv themes and policy outcomes, with measurable metrics delivered during the life of contract.
life chances through procurement is part of the department’s response to these obligations and allows commercial directorate to make a greater contribution to the objectives of the department.
modern slavery
dwp has zero tolerance toward modern slavery and human trafficking.
in addition to mandatory questions that identify bidders convicted of slavery offences, all our procurements with a value exceeding £100k are required to include an upfront risk assessment and further measures included where appropriate, including requiring suppliers to complete the government developed modern slavery assessment tool (msat) to give visibility of the supply chain and suppliers own approach to managing the risk of slavery occurring.
suppliers of our most important contracts are also required to complete an msat as standard.
we published our first modern slavery statement in autumn 2021 setting our approach to tackling the risk of slavery in our supply chains and a commitment to updating progress annually.
commercial complaints process
if you are making a complaint regarding our competitive processes, provide as much detail as you can.
we are fully committed to maintaining confidentiality and will take appropriate measures to ensure it. if you are currently involved in tendering for work with dwp you can be assured that your comments will not be allowed to prejudice the fair treatment of your tender.
how to complain
make your complaint in writing to the procurement manager shown in the tender documentation.
what happens when i make a complaint?
we will take seriously any complaint and undertake appropriate investigations. where mistakes have been made, we will take suitable corrective action and put in place any necessary remedial measures to prevent any future incidences.
public procurement review service
concerns from suppliers (and potential suppliers) about public procurement practice and the late payment of valid and undisputed invoices can also be made to the public procurement review service.
transforming public procurement
the procurement act achieved royal assent in autumn 2023.
what the act will do
this is an important piece of legislation which will revolutionise the way the public sector buys goods and services, bringing a range of benefits, including:
creating a simpler and more flexible commercial system that better meets our country’s needs while remaining compliant with our international obligations
opening up public procurement to new entrants such as small businesses and social enterprises so that they can compete for and win more public contracts
taking tougher action on underperforming suppliers and excluding suppliers who pose unacceptable risks
embedding transparency throughout the commercial lifecycle so that the spending of taxpayers’ money can be properly scrutinised
when the changes will happen
the procurement act 2023 went into effect on 24 february 2025.
the changes will only apply to competitions published on or after 24 february 2025.
benefits for suppliers
suppliers of goods, works or services to dwp will need to know about these changes and our plans to prepare for the revised go-live date.
for suppliers there will be new features which should make it easier to do business with contracting authorities:
a central digital platform for suppliers to register and store their details so that they can be used for multiple bids and see all opportunities in one place
simplified bidding processes to make it easier to bid, negotiate and work in partnership with the public sector – including a new ‘competitive flexible’ procedure
commercial frameworks will be more flexible, so prospective suppliers are not shut out for long periods of time
a new duty on contracting authorities to have regard to the particular barriers facing smes and vcses, and to consider what can be done to overcome them throughout the procurement lifecycle, helping level the playing field for smaller businesses so they can compete for more contracts
strengthened provisions for prompt payment throughout the supply chain – enabling smes to benefit from 30-day payment terms on a broader range of public sector contracts
a stronger exclusions framework will take tougher action on underperforming suppliers
these changes will drive innovation, deliver better outcomes and embed transparency right through the commercial lifecycle, so everyone can access procurement data and see how money is spent.
learn about the new regime
the government commercial function has provided a comprehensive training package for procurement practitioners in government departments and public bodies to ensure the benefits of the new regime are quickly realised, and is also working with leading business groups and trade associations to make some of this training as well as guidance and support available for the suppliers.
there is a range of information and resources about the new regime on the transforming public procurement landing page including a series of ‘knowledge drop’ training videos with tailored versions designed specifically for suppliers, including sme and vcse suppliers.
dedicated information for suppliers, particularly around the procurement review unit and central digital platform will be issued by the cabinet office.
read a factsheet in about the central digital platform.
if you would like to discuss any aspect of the new act please contact the dedicated transforming public procurement helpdesk at procurement.reform@cabinetoffice.gov.uk.

equality objectives 2023 to 2025
as an employer, dwp is committed to the civil service ambition to become the uk’s most inclusive employer and we will continue to:
increase the representation of currently under-represented groups to make dwp more diverse
build an inclusive environment, where colleagues are able to be themselves at work and feel supported, empowered, valued, respected, fairly treated and able to achieve their full potential
our goal is to ensure that these commitments, reinforced by our values, are embedded in our day-to-day working practices with all our customers, colleagues and partners.
as an inclusive employer we will not tolerate discrimination. our hr policies are fully inclusive of all staff regardless of:
age
working-pattern
disability or long term health conditions
sex
sexual orientation
pregnancy and maternity
race
ethnicity
nationality
religion or belief
gender identity expression or reassignment
relationship status
marital status (including equal/same sex marriage) and civil partnership
caring responsibilities
trade union activity or political beliefs
any other grounds.
we will demonstrate our commitment by:
promoting equality of opportunity and diversity within the communities in which we work and with all our partners and workforce
treating our customers, colleagues and partners fairly and with respect
ensuring our customers have access to reasonable adjustments or additional support to enable them to access benefits, use our services and meet their individual responsibilities
aiming to build a workforce which reflects our customer base, within the diverse communities in which we work, with the aim of having equal representation across the workforce
embedding equality analysis into all our service delivery and decision making processes
promoting an environment free from discrimination, bullying and harassment, and taking action where such unacceptable behaviour exists
utilising equality data to monitor the impact of our policies and procedures and inform future changes
building in legislative requirements and best practice to all our service delivery and employee policies and procedures, and supporting these with appropriate training and guidance
setting departmental equality objectives to increase the diversity of our workforce and foster an inclusive environment where different perspectives and colleague experiences are valued
every person working for the department has a personal responsibility for implementing and promoting these commitments in their day-to-day dealings with everyone – including members of the public, other colleagues and employers and partners. inappropriate behaviour is not acceptable.
we will measure and report on the effectiveness of our service delivery and employee policies and processes, in relation to these commitments through performance and management information monitoring. this information will be used to inform future policy and to enhance business processes.
learning and development for colleagues
we think it is important that all our colleagues understand the importance of diversity, equality and inclusion and can contribute to the achievement of the department’s objectives. all colleagues have access to a range of learning and development products to help build their knowledge and understanding.
there are a number of employee led diversity and inclusion staff networks that include a focus on age, carers, disability, faith and belief, gender, gender identity, race, transgender, sexual orientation and social mobility. these networks contribute directly to departmental diversity and inclusion priorities by acting as a consultation forum, and by providing safe spaces for colleagues to share their experiences and promotion of best practice.
disability and carer confident
dwp is recognised as being both a disability confident leader and also carer confident (ambassador). both of these assessments demonstrate the departmental commitment to attracting, recruiting and retaining disabled people and those with caring responsibilities, and supporting them in the workplace to achieve their full potential.
thriving at work
the framework outlined in the thriving at work review supports employers to voluntarily report on disability, mental health and wellbeing in the workplace. dwp publishes a voluntary report on disability, mental health and wellbeing, updated annually, and has also signed the mental health at work commitment.
business in the community
dwp is committed to taking practical steps to tackle recruitment and progression barriers and increasing the diversity of our workforce. dwp was an early signatory of the business in the community’s race at work charter.
age friendly employer
dwp is the first government department to sign the centre for ageing better age-friendly employer pledge. dwp is committed to exemplary practice in the recruitment, retention and support of workers to ensure all age groups have equitable access to opportunities within our organisation.
social mobility
we externally measure our progress on improving our socio-economic diversity through participation in the social mobility employer index to ensure all colleagues irrespective of their background have the support needed to progress their careers.
public sector equality duty
the equality act 2010 applied a public sector equality duty (psed) to public bodies. the equality duty requires public authorities to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations. in addition, many public bodies, including the dwp, have specific duties under the act.
the specific duties require us to publish:
equality information
equality objectives
equality information
as a public authority, we must publish, at least annually, relevant, proportionate information demonstrating our compliance with the equality duty. this replaces the previous requirement to publish equality schemes.
we’ve published separate reports about employee and customer data since 2014.

equality objectives 2023 to 2025
as part of our commitment to embedding and meeting our public sector equalities duties, we have set the following objectives:
tackling employment gap inequalities for ethnic minority jobseekers in areas where there is a high ethnic minority population and a high employment gap. we will do this through outreach activity with the voluntary sector and other organisations supporting ethnic minority young people to create job and skills opportunities, mentoring circles and collaborating with employers to increase the diversity of their workforces.
improving employment outcomes for underrepresented groups such as women and those from ethnic minority backgrounds, and supporting those on low incomes back into, and to progress in work.
work through jcp alongside local areas, and wider government to minimise additional barriers disabled people may face when in and out of work, with a focus on better aligning the work and health systems.
work to ensure that employers have the support, guidance and confidence in order that they can promote healthy and inclusive workplaces and to continually reduce the disability employment gap.
assist those aged fifty and over through early and targeted employment, skills and employer-led support, to stay in, progress or return to work and build their future financial resilience.
maximising jobcentre support and opportunities for people with caring responsibilities and those with disabilities and health conditions to actively prepare for, start and succeed in work, ensuring as best as possible that claimant commitments and support are tailored to peoples’ individual circumstances.
strengthening implementation of the family test assessment in all our domestic policy areas. inclusion of family test outcomes in all relevant policy advice submitted to our ministers and promoting cross-government implementation.
for public appointments to dwp’s arm’s-length bodies, we continue to encourage applications from talented individuals from all backgrounds and across the whole of the united kingdom, with the aim of increasing the number of appointments to those based outside london and the south east.

our flexible working arrangements can be affected by the nature of the role, so please ask about the options at interview.

nuclear decommissioning authority
about us
we're charged, on behalf of government, with the mission to clean-up the uk’s earliest nuclear sites safely, securely and cost effectively.

our sites

our strategic approach and themes

corporate information
we’re committed to overcoming the challenges of nuclear clean-up and decommissioning, leaving the 17 nuclear sites ready for their next use.
we do this work with care for our people, communities and the environment, with safety, as always, our number one priority.
nuclear decommissioning authority: our uk mission
what we do
as owners of one of the largest nuclear decommissioning and remediation programmes in europe, our main priority is to lead the work across the nda group and develop the strategy for how it should be carried out. we also play an important role in supporting government’s aspiration for the uk to be a global leader in the civil nuclear sector.
our strategy is continually evolving and is updated every five years.
we strive to deliver best value for the uk taxpayer by focusing on reducing the highest hazards and risks, while ensuring safe, secure, and environmentally responsible operations at our sites.
we seek ways to reduce the level of public funding from government by generating revenue through our commercial activities.
how we’re set up
we’re a non-departmental public body created by the energy act 2004 to lead the clean-up and decommissioning work at our 17 sites on behalf of government.
we’re sponsored and funded by the department for energy, security and net zero (desnz). our plans for cleaning up the sites are approved by desnz and scottish ministers, who provide a framework for us.
we have offices across the uk, in cumbria, warrington, dounreay, harwell and london and employ just over 380 permanent staff.
as a non-departmental public body, the nda supports a wide range of government policy developments such as the nuclear sector deal and the ten point plan for a green industrial revolution with intellectual thought, physical assets and research and development.
our sites
the uk’s nuclear landscape began to take shape in the post-war period and has evolved over many decades. the focus during the cold war arms race was on producing material for britain’s nuclear deterrent. when the nation’s priorities shifted, facilities were turned into nuclear power stations, and, from 1956 onwards, the uk’s first nuclear power stations began generating electricity for homes and businesses. fuel fabrication and reprocessing plants were built from the 1970s to 1990s.
our 17 sites reflect this legacy and include the first fleet of nuclear power stations, research centres, fuel-related facilities, and sellafield, which has the largest radioactive inventory and the most complex facilities to decommission.
current plans indicate it will take more than 100 years to complete our core mission of nuclear clean-up and waste management. the goal is to achieve the end state at all sites by 2380.
uk map of sites (png, 155 kb)
the nda group
decommissioning the uk’s nuclear legacy is a complex undertaking and relies on the full range of expertise and skills within the nda group. over the last few years we’ve brought together the organisations involved in delivering our mission to decommission the uk’s legacy sites and facilities into one group, as nda subsidiary operating companies. we’ve also taken steps to join some of our subsidiary operating companies, reducing the number of organisations and boards.
the nda group is now made up of the nda and its four key component parts:
sellafield
nuclear restoration services
nuclear waste services
nuclear transport solutions.
our other subsidiaries include rutherford indemnity, nda archives, nda properties and energus.
the scope of the nda group is set to grow, following arrangements agreed by the uk government and edf for decommissioning britain’s seven advanced gas-cooled reactors (agrs).
the agrs will reach the end of their operational lives over the next 10 years and as they come offline their ownership will transfer to the nda for decommissioning, utilising the expertise of our group and significantly nuclear restoration services and its experience in decommissioning the older stations.
our strategic approach and themes
our strategic themes
we use five strategic themes to describe all the activities needed to deliver the nda’s mission.
the first four strategic themes, spent fuels, nuclear materials, integrated waste management and site decommissioning and remediation relate directly to our clean-up and decommissioning work and are known as driving themes.
the fifth theme describes the important activities needed to support the delivery of our mission and is known as critical enablers.
currently, the most urgent task is dealing with our sites’ highest-hazard materials, spent fuel, nuclear materials and highly-radioactive wastes.
once the inventory has been made safe, the redundant nuclear facilities can be dismantled and demolished.
the integration of the nda strategic themes (jpeg, 1.27 mb)
our driving themes and strategic outcomes
across our four driving themes, we break our mission down into 47 strategic outcomes. these outcomes represent the significant pieces of work that have to be achieved to deliver our mission.
increasingly, we’re building a more accurate picture of the work that’s been completed across our 47 outcomes and that which is still left to do.
see our priorities and progress page for a more in depth look at how we’re performing against these strategic outcomes and our mission.

corporate information
introduction to dbs
the disclosure and barring service (dbs) helps employers make safer recruitment decisions each year by processing and issuing dbs checks for england, wales, the channel islands and the isle of man. dbs also maintains the adults’ and children’s barred lists, and makes considered decisions as to whether an individual should be included on one or both of these lists and barred from engaging in regulated activity.
dbs checks
our disclosure teams carry out dbs checks (previously known as crb, or criminal record checks).
there are four types of dbs check, and each type results in a dbs certificate being issued to an individual. employers can then ask to see the certificate to ensure that they are recruiting suitable people into their organisation.
the four levels of dbs check are:
basic dbs check
standard dbs check
enhanced dbs check
enhanced with barred list(s) dbs check
the information contained on each type of check is different.
basic dbs check
a basic dbs check is for any purpose, including employment. the certificate will contain details of convictions and conditional cautions that are considered to be unspent under the terms of the rehabilitation of offenders act (roa) 1974.
an individual can apply for a basic check directly to dbs through our online application route, or an employer can apply for a basic check on an individual’s behalf, through a responsible organisation, if they have consent.
standard dbs check
a standard dbs check is suitable for certain roles, such as a security guard. the certificate will contain details of both spent and unspent convictions, cautions, reprimands and warnings that are held on the police national computer, which are not subject to filtering.
an individual cannot apply for a standard check by themselves. there must be a recruiting organisation who needs the applicant to get the check. this is then sent to dbs through a registered body.
the service is free for volunteers.
enhanced dbs check
an enhanced dbs check is suitable for people working with children or adults in certain circumstances such as those in receipt of healthcare or personal care. an enhanced dbs check is also suitable for a small number of other roles such as taxi licence applications or people working in the gambling commission.
the certificate will contain the same details as a standard certificate and, if the role is eligible, an employer can request that one or both of the dbs barred lists are checked.
the certificate may also contain non-conviction information supplied by relevant police forces, if it is deemed relevant and ought to be contained in the certificate.
an individual cannot apply for an enhanced dbs check by themselves. there must be a recruiting organisation who needs the applicant to get the check. this is then sent to dbs through a registered body.
the service is free for volunteers.
enhanced with barred lists dbs check
an enhanced with barred lists dbs check is also suitable for people working with children or adults in certain circumstances such as those in receipt of healthcare or personal care.
an enhanced with barred lists certificate will contain the same information as an enhanced dbs certificate, but will also include a check of one or both barred lists.
eligibility
eligibility for standard, enhanced, and enhanced with barred lists dbs checks is prescribed in legislation. recruiters should only request a dbs check on an individual when they are legally allowed to do so – they must be entitled by law to ask an individual to reveal their full criminal history. this is known as asking ‘an exempted question.’
an exempted question applies when the individual will be working in specific occupations, for certain licences and specified positions. these are covered by the rehabilitation of offenders act 1974 (exceptions) order 1975.
the minimum age at which someone can be asked to apply for a criminal record check is 16 years old.
the dbs eligibility tool can be used to determine what type of check a role could be eligible for, as can our eligibility guidance.
barring
an enhanced with barred lists dbs check will include a check of one or both of the barred lists that dbs manages and maintains. if an individual is listed, this will appear on their dbs certificate.
it is our responsibility at dbs to maintain these lists. this area of our work involves making fair, consistent, and thorough decisions that are appropriate to the behaviour that has occurred, and consider the risk of future harm.
people are brought to the attention of our barring team in one of three ways:
automatic barring offence, also known as ‘autobar’
disclosure
referral
automatic, also known as autobar
this is when someone has been newly-convicted or cautioned for a serious offence and they are considered for immediate barring, either with or without the opportunity to make representations. this information comes from the police national computer.
disclosure
this is when someone applies for an enhanced dbs check to work with children or adults in certain circumstances, such as those in receipt of healthcare or personal care, and the check reveals relevant information that results in the individual being considered for inclusion on one or both of the barred lists.
referral
this is when an employer, volunteer manager, or other organisation has concerns that someone has either caused harm or has the potential to cause harm to vulnerable groups and submits a barring referral to dbs.
regulated activity providers (employers or volunteer managers of people working in regulated activity in england, wales, and northern ireland) and personnel suppliers have a legal duty to refer to dbs where certain conditions are met.
referrals can be made online or via post. to submit an online referral, create a dbs online account and once logged in, select ‘submit a referral’. alternatively, you can complete the dbs paper referral form and send to:
disclosure and barring service
po box 3963
royal wootton bassett
sn4 4hh
it is important that anyone referring someone to us provides as much information as possible. more information regarding barring referrals can be found in our barring referrals guidance.
barring representations
where an individual is the subject of any of the above three barring referral types (excluding ‘autobar without representation’), the individual will be given the opportunity to provide ‘representations’ as to why they feel it would be inappropriate or disproportionate for dbs to include them on one or both of the barred lists.
dbs will consider the individual’s representations before making a final barring decision. further information about barring representations can be found in our barring referrals: making representations guidance.
test for regulated activity
dbs can only bar a person from working within regulated activity with children or adults if we believe the person is, has been, or might in the future be, engaged in regulated activity.
the only exception to this is where a person is cautioned or convicted for a relevant (automatic barring) offence and is not eligible to submit representations against their inclusion on a barred list.
where a person is cautioned or convicted of a relevant (automatic barring) offence with the right to make representations, dbs will ask the person to submit their representations and consider these before making a final barring decision.
update service
the update service is an online subscription, for standard, enhanced and enhanced with barred lists dbs checks, that allows applicants to keep their dbs certificates up-to-date and allows employers to view an applicant’s certificate.
the update service cannot currently be used for basic dbs checks.
who we work with
dbs works with a number of different organisations and departments, including but not limited to:
police forces in england, wales, scotland, northern ireland, the channel islands and the isle of man – the police provide information that is held locally, or on the police national computer
acro criminal records office (acro) – manages criminal record information and improves the exchange of criminal records and biometric information
responsible organisations – a responsible organisation is an organisation that is registered with dbs to submit basic dbs checks
registered bodies - a registered body is an organisation that is registered with dbs to submit standard, enhanced, and enhanced with barred lists dbs checks
registered bodies
a registered body is an organisation that is registered with dbs to submit standard, enhanced and enhanced with barred lists dbs checks, and is entitled by law to ask an individual to reveal their full criminal history – also known as asking ‘an exempted question’.
subscribe to dbs updates
if you want to be notified when an update is made to the dbs gov.uk website, or new content is added, you can subscribe with your email address, here.
bills and legislation
the rehabilitation of offenders act (roa) 1974 sets out in legislation rehabilitation periods, and that individuals do not have to disclose spent convictions unless they are covered in the rehabilitation of offenders act 1975 (exceptions) order 1975
the rehabilitation of offenders act 1975 (exceptions) order 1975 sets out the exceptions for when an individual can be asked about spent convictions – known as asking ‘an exempted question’
the safeguarding vulnerable groups act 2006 sets out the scope of regulated activity and operation of the barring element of dbs, which was previously undertaken by the independent safeguarding authority (isa)
the criminal records bureau, which is now part of dbs, was established under part v of the police act 1997. this was updated as a result of part 5 of the protection of freedoms act 2012.
part 5 of the protection of freedoms act 2012 covers the reduction in scope of the definition of regulated activity, new services provided by dbs, and disregarding convictions and cautions for consensual gay sex.

transgender applicants are protected in legislation and are not obliged to include details indicating a previous gender in their application form.
dbs has a process in place which allows any details indicating a previous gender to be checked without being disclosed on the completed certificate.
they are, however, required by law to provide all name details to dbs in their current and any previous identity. deliberately withholding this information may be an attempt to prevent conviction information being revealed and is an offence.

corporate information
who we are
we are the regulator of charities in england and wales and maintain the charity register.
we are an independent, non-ministerial government department accountable to parliament.
as registrar, we are responsible for maintaining an accurate and up-to-date register of charities. this includes deciding whether organisations are charitable and should be registered. we also remove charities that are not considered to be charitable, no longer exist or do not operate.
we work across 4 sites in liverpool, london, newport and taunton. our newport office operates bilingually in welsh and english. we employ around 450 people.
our ambition
to be the expert charity commission that is fair, balanced, and independent so that charity can thrive.
five priorities describe the commission’s key areas of focus, as well as the steps it will take to fulfil these ambitions:
we will be fair and proportionate in our work and clear about our role.
we will support charities to get it right but take robust action where we see wrongdoing and harm.
we will speak with authority and credibility, free from the influence of others.
we will embrace technological innovation and strengthen how we use our data.
we will be the expert commission - where our people are empowered and enabled to deliver excellence in regulation.
read the charity commission strategy 2024 to 2029 for more information.
find out more about our governance.
responsibilities
within england and wales, our responsibilities are:
registering eligible organisations in england and wales which are established for only charitable purposes
taking enforcement action where there is malpractice or misconduct. for example, freezing a charity’s bank account, or suspending or removing a trustee
ensuring charities meet their legal requirements, including providing information on their activities each year
making appropriate information about each registered charity widely available to the public
providing guidance to help charities run as effectively as possible
providing online services for charities
you can read more about the charity commission in our latest annual report and accounts.

youth custody service
about us
the youth custody service aims to create a safe, decent and nurturing environment that provides outstanding levels of care and support for children in custody.

what the ycs does
established in september 2017 as a distinct part of hm prison and probation service (hmpps), the ycs is responsible for the operational running of (public sector) sites across youth secure estate, for children and young people between 10-17 in england and wales.
we are responsible for commissioning of services and contractual management of private sector sites, as well as placing children and young people remanded or sentenced to custody.
the youth secure estate is made up of four under 18 young offender institutions, one secure training centre, eight secure children’s homes and one secure school.
the ycs is dedicated to working with a wide range of central and local government partners and other agencies to improve the life chances for young people, bringing the child voice into service design and to learning from latest research and best practice.
priorities
the ambitions of the ycs match those of the wider hmpps, however, given the distinct and often complex needs of our young cohort, we interpret these principles specifically to the children and young people in our care.
the ycs aim to be a provider of high-quality children’s services, where skilled, enthusiastic staff have the tools and capability to work with children in order to meet their individual needs, so that they are better able to lead rewarding, constructive lives upon their release.
we want to ensure that children in custody are protected from being harmed and prevented from causing harm; that youth custody is an educational and supportive environment, helping to reduce risky behaviour and improve the life chances upon release.

statistics on international development (sid) are accredited official statistics. this means they are official statistics that have been independently reviewed by the office for statistics regulation (osr) and comply with the standards in the code of practice for statistics. accredited official statistics are called national statistics in the statistics and registration service act 2007.
sid focuses on the main international measure of official aid spend, known as official development assistance (oda). sid is published twice each year: provisional aid spend is published in the spring and final aid spend in the autumn.
the provisional sid publication is based on summary data with limited sector and geography breakdown. the final sid publication is based on finalised data and provides detailed breakdowns including a project-level dataset.

our purpose
defra, in partnership with its arms’ length bodies, publish a broad range of statistics and data on the environment, food, farming and biosecurity and marine. we see our statistics as a valuable public asset. through them we seek to provide a window on the world across the areas covered by defra’s policy and delivery remits and to inform the judgements and decisions made by the public, by organisations and by government.
our portfolio
defra group publish regular and ad hoc statistics which provide accurate and impartial information across four main themes. browse our main portfolios:
environment
food, farming and biosecurity
marine
rural
our latest and upcoming publications
in current circumstances, the release dates of forthcoming defra group statistics publications may need to change. our aim is to flag any changes to planned publication dates as soon as we can. any decisions to change publications dates will be made in line with guidance from the office for statistics regulation.
for queries about specific planned release dates, please contact the relevant mailboxes.
a separate calendar of release dates across the group for the year ahead, providing a split by month, is available defra statistics release calendar, annual and monthly (ods, 39.9 kb).
our standards
we publish our national and official statistics guided by the uk statistics authority’s code of practice for statistics. many of these are accredited official statistics, which are subject to assessment by the uk statistics authority. accredited official statistics are called national statistics in the statistics and registration service act 2007. reports of all assessments are published on the authority’s website.
how we meet the standards of the code
the arrangements we have in place to ensure we comply with the code are set out in the documents below:
defra policy statement on revisions and corrections
defra group statistics quality statement
defra group breaches of the code of practice for official statistics
pre-release access to official statistics
we publish details of how we comply with the pre-release access to official statistics order 2008 and a list of the roles of those currently granted pre-release access to our key official statistics.
defra group pre-release access to official statistics compliance statement
list of statistics with pre-release access
ad hoc analyses and data releases
these publications provide analyses and data that are not classified as research or official statistics.
these are published in the interests of transparency and in response to specific questions.
ad hoc analyses and data releases
developing our portfolios
defra and defra group more broadly has a wide portfolio of statistics and our commitment is to the continued development of that portfolio. informed by the code of practice for statistics, much of our focus is on understanding of external user needs. we are building a range of approaches for this – including direct engagement (e.g. via the @defrastats twitter account) and through enhanced web analytics. we will continue to evolve in response to feedback by looking at accessibility of formats and continue to look for opportunities to increase value. looking further forward, we will continue to assess the opportunities provided by new technologies such as e-dna and earth observation.
within each of our areas of interest, we will look to find the best long-term balance between:
overall portfolio summary products such as the compendium of food and farming statistics.
continued production of regular individual official statistical releases on specific topics.
production of simpler more data focused releases (where user insight tells us that the external interest is in the numbers rather than the commentary).
where we see the potential value of new official statistics products or developing existing products, we will look to use the mechanisms in the code of practice for statistics. specifically, we may introduce new official statistics in development, where we decide to develop a new output or modify an existing one. these statistics are, by definition, official statistics and are within the scope of the code of practice. during development, we seek feedback from users on their suitability and quality.
another option open to us is to use the recently introduced voluntary application of the code of practice approach.
across defra group, the following official statistics are in development:

we do this by being impartial and increasingly effective and efficient in our administration. we help the honest majority to get their tax right and make it hard for the dishonest minority to cheat the system.

what we do
hmrc is the uk’s tax, payments and customs authority, and we have a vital purpose: we collect the money that pays for the uk’s public services, and help families and individuals with targeted financial support.
we do this by being impartial and increasingly effective and efficient in our administration. we help the honest majority to get their tax right and make it hard for the dishonest minority to cheat the system.
hmrc is a non-ministerial department, supported by 2 agencies and public bodies.

register land or property with us
once land or property is entered in the register, we record any ownership changes, mortgages or leases that affect it. anyone who suffers loss because of an error or omission in the register, or because the register needs to be corrected, will normally be compensated.

our governance
it’s important that the public, ministers and staff have confidence that we’re making progress against our objectives and doing the things they expect of us.
the northern ireland office (nio) boards and committees are responsible for making sure that we carry out our work as efficiently as possible, meeting our legal and other obligations. these governance structures are also responsible for ensuring we have identified risks that might affect our work, and have plans in place to deal with these risks. the permanent secretary of the nio is also the accounting officer with a particular responsibility for overseeing the delivery of the nio business plan.
departmental board
the departmental board forms the collective strategic and operational leadership of the department, bringing together our ministers, senior directors and non-executive board members. the board:
provides challenge and advice on strategic issues linked to the delivery of objectives.
sets the overall strategic direction for the department in the light of ministerial priorities, resources available and the commitments set out in the nio business plan.
oversees the management of risks within the department.
monitors performance and delivery of the nio business plan.
departmental board meetings
the board meets once a quarter.
departmental board members
the departmental board is chaired by the secretary of state with membership comprising the permanent secretary, chief operating officer and two non-executive board members from outside government. board members include:
hilary benn, secretary of state for northern ireland
julie harrison, permanent secretary
holly clark, chief operating officer
les philpott, lead non-executive board member
fiona ross, non-executive board member
the board secretary, deputy director for people and services transformation, clare sloan also attends each board meeting, alongside the nio deputy director for finance and information management. board meetings are also attended by a representative from the nio mirror board which represents staff interests. the board invites other attendees to meetings as required.
executive committee
the executive committee supports the departmental board and accounting officer through the consideration of issues that have a significant impact on the work of the nio. the executive committee comprises the senior leadership team whose purpose is to:
discuss and agree the policy and delivery priorities for the department in line with the departmental strategy;
sets corporate governance and assurance arrangements for the nio;
consider and manages all operational and strategic risks and issues that may have a significant impact on ministerial priorities;
advises the board on the overall disposition and allocation of resources across the department and its wider family;
oversees the structure and function of the department and the bodies it sponsors
executive committee meetings
the executive committee meets on a monthly basis.
executive committee members
members of the executive committee are:
julie harrison, permanent secretary
holly clark, chief operating officer
chris flatt, director, public services & economic growth
caroline hacker, director, security and reconciliation
will gelling, director, strategy and external affairs
nio audit risk and assurance committee
the audit risk and assurance committee advises the departmental board and the department’s accounting officer on risk management, corporate governance and assurance arrangements for nio and its funded bodies. the committee is responsible for:
reviewing the department’s accounting policies, accounts, annual governance statement and annual report as well as any issues arising from them;
regularly reviewing the departmental risk register and the quality of risk management within the department;
the accountability arrangements established to support the accounting officer
audit strategies and plans, and the department’s response to any issues identified by internal or external audits
the department’s business code of conduct, anti-fraud policies, whistle-blowing policy and arrangements for special investigations
responding to findings and recommendations from external bodies (for example, the house of commons public accounts committee and the northern ireland affairs committee)
audit risk and assurance committee meetings
the committee usually meets at least 4 times a year, with meetings in late spring and early summer to consider the annual report and accounts.
audit risk and assurance committee members
the current members are:
les philpott, (chair), lead non-executive board member
fiona ross, non-executive board member
neil sayers, independent member
julie harrison, permanent secretary, and accounting officer, and holly clark, chief operating officer also attend audit risk and assurance committee meetings. they are joined by internal and external auditors. the committee may invite other attendees as necessary for particular items.
funded bodies
in addition to the core department and the independent challenge and assurances that the non-executive board members and the audit risk and assurance committee provide, the nio is also supported in its work by a network of associated bodies that operate independently of government. these all differ in terms of their size, formal status, statutory or other responsibilities and the degree of independence from government but they play an important role.
our non-departmental public bodies (ndpbs) are:
the northern ireland human rights commission
the parades commission for northern ireland
the independent reporting commission

guidance for our sectors
real-time energy use
we collect information about our energy use from our main utility meters (electricity, gas and water) at the end of each day. the continual capture of data allows us to monitor how much energy and water we are using each day, week, month and year.
to see our real-time energy data, visit our energy monitoring microsite at data.gov.uk.
this data is also available on the dcms page of the carbon culture website.
climate change
the ‘uk climate change projections 2009’ published by defra (department for environment, food and rural affairs) show that we can expect hotter summers, wetter winters and more extreme weather in the future.
climate change has the potential to impact on all areas of dcms business including:
damage to our historical and cultural assets
difficulties in maintaining public parks and sports pitches
flooding of tourist destinations and leisure facilities
however, a changing climate could also provide opportunities, with a greater call for outside events and sports in summer, an increase in tourism, and investment in sustainable architecture.
we, and our sectors, also have a role in mitigating future damage by reducing carbon emissions and contributing to the overall uk and global drive to create a more sustainable future.
what we are doing in dcms
our current priorities are to:
provide our sectors with information, evidence and support about climate change
help raise awareness and generate debate about climate change in our sectors
provide further forums for policy makers and front-line practitioners
develop specific adaptation plans for our sector
guidance for our sectors

rail accident investigation branch
about us
the rail accident investigation branch (raib) independently investigates accidents to improve railway safety, and inform the industry and the public.

corporate information
who we are
lord cullen’s inquiry report on the ladbroke grove rail accident in 1999 recommended the creation of an organisation to independently investigate railway accidents to improve safety. raib became operational in october 2005 as the independent body for investigating accidents and incidents on mainline railways, metros, tramways and heritage railways throughout the uk.
we employ inspectors and principal inspectors with either a professional railway or investigation background. we have given them extensive training in railway operations, railway engineering and investigation skills. including the inspectors and the team who provide essential business support, we have a total staff of 43 people.
we’re based in operational centres in derby and farnborough. having two centres means we can respond quicker to accidents in any part of the uk.
our investigations are focused solely on improving safety. we are not a prosecuting body and do not apportion blame or liability. possible breaches of legislation are dealt with by other organisations, usually the police and safety authorities.
we are totally independent and our chief inspector reports the outcomes of investigations to the secretary of state for transport. an introduction to the raib
our responsibilities
we’re responsible for:
investigating the causes of railway accidents and incidents where we believe our investigation will bring safety learning to the industry
identifying the factors that may lead to a similar accident or make the consequences worse
highlighting gaps in the railway industry’s safety defences that are revealed during our investigations
making recommendations to prevent the same thing happening again
increasing awareness of how railway accidents happen
co-operating with other investigation organisations nationally and internationally to share and encourage good practice.
whenever we investigate, we publish the results as an investigation report. we also produce safety digests, which highlight learning points which have emerged from our preliminary examination of an event.
raib’s scope
raib investigates accidents and incidents which occur on the uk main line networks (network rail and northern ireland railways), london underground, other metro systems, tramways, heritage railways and the uk part of the channel tunnel. operators of these types of railway and tramway have a duty under the law to notify raib of some types of accidents and incidents. some operations that may seem to be related to railways are not actually within the scope of our powers. locations and systems which are wholly or partly out of scope include:
self-contained railways entirely on private land which do not cross a carriageway (by a level crossing, bridge or tunnel)
industrial railway systems (including docks)
museums
funfairs
cliff lifts
we have published full guidance on our scope, as well as guidance on the types of event which are required to be notified to us.
we monitor operations on the major networks through various industry reporting systems. we have the legal power and the discretion to decide to investigate any event that occurs on a system that is within our scope, not just those that have to be notified to us.
some events on the main line railways that result in death or serious injury will not be investigated by raib (and in some cases they do not have to be notified to us). there are two main reasons why this may happen. in many cases, from the information available at the time, it appears that the person concerned has deliberately trespassed or otherwise put themselves in harm’s way. sometimes we are satisfied, after making enquiries, that although an accidental sequence of events has resulted in tragic consequences, there are no safety lessons to be learned, and so we will not investigate further.
raib’s response to notifications
on being notified of an accident or incident, our normal approach is to obtain sufficient information to decide how to respond.
our legal basis
uk legislation
the railways and transport safety act 2003(the 2003 act) established the rail accident investigation branch (raib), and section 8 of the act provides the powers that our inspectors use during their investigations. we have published guidance to assist with using the act.
the railways (accident investigation and reporting) regulations 2005 (si1992)(the 2005 regulations) set out the details of the raib’s duties, the scope of our work and our dealings with other people and organisations involved in rail accidents. we have published guidance to assist with using the regulations.
the regulations came into force for mainland uk on 17 october 2005 and the raib became operational on that date. operations were further extended to cover the channel tunnel from 31 january 2006.
eu legislation
since 2004, the railway safety directive (2004/49/eu) and its subsequent amendment in 2008 has created a european framework for safety management. the aim of this common approach was to ensure the development and improvement of safety and create a single market for european rail transport.
the directive aims to provide a means for ensuring that serious railway accidents and incidents are independently investigated in a blame-free manner, with a published report which identifies causes and makes recommendations to improve the safety of the railway and prevent future accidents and incidents.
the directive requires every member state to establish a national safety authority, which is the office of rail and road in great britain, and a national investigating body (nib) (the raib in the uk). the european railway agency, set up in 2004, helping rail organisations work together to produce a common framework for safety in europe. this includes establishing a network of the member states’ nib’s to share and promote best practices.
each nib is required to be entirely independent in its organisation, legal structure and decision-making from any other party or body. it must also be functionally independent from the safety authority and from any regulator of railways.
the directive was transposed into uk legislation by the 2003 act and the 2005 regulations. we are currently working to revise and update the regulations in the light of new legislation and eleven years’ operating experience.
the role of other organisations
the safety of the uk’s railway industry is heavily reliant on the quality of the relationships with a number of different organisations
our mission and ambitions
we independently investigate accidents to improve railway safety, and inform the industry and the public.
the raib will:
undertake high quality investigations safely and in a timely manner
publish safety learning in a manner that adds value to industry’s management of risk
have a culture of integrity, honesty, objectivity, impartiality, trust, respect and empathy
have an environment that actively encourages and facilitates staff development
the raib and its staff will:
be well-respected within industry and considered to be world class accident investigators
interact with others, inside and outside the organisation in a positive, sensitive, inclusive and efficient manner
adapt to changes in industry, technology and society

government internal fraud initiative
from monday 30 october 2017, dfid will be participating in the government internal fraud initiative in conjunction with the cabinet office. the purpose of the initiative is to protect the civil service and public funds against loss caused by internal fraud and dishonest conduct, and introduce a strong deterrent against it.
under the initiative, a 5 year ban preventing individuals gaining employment in any participating department will be imposed on anyone dismissed for fraudulent or dishonest conduct. individuals who resign or otherwise leave, but would have been dismissed had they continued in employment will also be subject to the ban.
successful interview candidates to dfid will be screened against the cabinet office database. the cabinet office will use information on the outcome of any checks for monitoring and analysis purposes, and to ensure that checks are being carried out correctly. the data will also be used for research on the prevention and detection of fraud. no data will be shared outside of the department for international development, cabinet office, civil service resourcing, and other participating departments except on an anonymised basis.
alumni association
over time dfid has benefitted from an exceptionally talented and diverse group of employees. dfid’s alumni network maintains connections between current employees and alumni and improves access to organisational knowledge and experience. if you have worked for dfid, the overseas development administration (oda) or the overseas development ministry (odm), the alumni association is for you. it’s your first port of call for getting the latest news from fellow alumni, and updates about the work of the department.

fcdo guidance, services and information
these services are now provided by fcdo: - international development funding opportunities - uk-funded development projects around the world
history of dfid
dfid was a ministerial department from may 1997 to september 2020. it merged with the foreign and commonwealth office to create fcdo.
what is uk aid?
responsibilities
we are responsible for:
honouring the uk’s international commitments and taking action to achieve the united nations’ global goals
making british aid more effective by improving transparency, openness and value for money
targeting british international development policy on economic growth and wealth creation
improving the coherence and performance of british international development policy in fragile and conflict-affected countries
improving the lives of girls and women through better education and a greater choice on family planning
preventing violence against girls and women in the developing world
helping to prevent climate change and encouraging adaptation and low-carbon growth in developing countries

strengthening global peace, security and governance
strengthening resilience and response to crisis

read our single departmental plan to find out more about how we are performing against our objectives.
who we are
the department for international development (dfid) was set up in 1997. we employ around 3,600 staff who work in our offices in london, east kilbride and globally.
organogram
summary organogram
where we work
we work in countries across africa, asia and the middle east, many of which are fragile or at risk from fragile neighbours. we also have regional programmes in africa, asia and the caribbean, and development relationships with 3 aid dependent overseas territories – st helena, the pitcairn islands and montserrat. in addition to working directly in countries, dfid also gives uk aid through multi-country global programmes and core contributions to multilaterals.
international development acts
three acts of parliament have helped to put development higher on the national agenda. the international development act 2002 provides the main legal basis for the provision of development assistance – assistance for the purpose of sustainable development or welfare, and likely to contribute to poverty reduction – and humanitarian assistance; the international development (reporting and transparency) act 2006 defines dfid’s reporting to parliament through its annual report; and the international development (official development assistance target) act 2015 enshrines into legislation the commitment to spend 0.7% of national income on aid.
case studies
our case studies explore the impact of dfid’s work and provide real-life examples of our policies in practice.
funding
we fund many organisations that are working to end poverty. find out about how our funding schemes work and how to apply.
reporting fraud or corrupt practices
there are scam messages being sent to the public relating to covid-19 by sms (text). please take note that the uk government will only ask you to go to the gov.uk/coronavirus website. anything else should be treated as a scam. if you receive a suspicious text, please forward it to 7726.
the internal audit department’s internal audit investigations section is the central point for raising concerns, suspicions and/or allegations of fraud, sexual exploitation and abuse or other corrupt practices. this includes both internal and external cases where dfid funds, assets or interests (including dfid’s reputation) are involved, as well as any breach of the civil service code.
iad’s internal audit investigations section has a dedicated secure email address for raising all concerns: reportingconcerns@dfid.gov.uk
alternatively, any concerns can be reported by:
calling the confidential hotline on +44 (0)1355 843747
writing to the head of internal audit, 22 whitehall, london, sw1a 2eg, united kingdom

national fraud initiative 2016/17
the use of dfid data to prevent or detect fraud.
dfid is participating in the national fraud initiative (nfi) 2016/17 data matching exercise carried out by the cabinet office. we are required by law to protect public funds that we administer and our participation in the nfi will assist in the prevention and detection of fraud.
we are participating on a voluntary basis and will provide the cabinet office with details of our trade creditors as set out in the cabinet office’s guidance.
this form of data matching involves comparing computer records held by one public body against those held by other public bodies to establish if there are any corresponding records. computerised data matching allows potentially fraudulent claims and payments to be identified. where an inconsistency is found it may indicate that further investigation is necessary.
the use of data by the cabinet office in a data matching exercise is carried out with statutory authority under its powers in part 2a of the audit commission act, 1998. it does not require the consent of the individuals concerned under the data protection act, 1998.
data matching by the cabinet office is subject to a code of practice.
further information on the cabinet office’s legal powers and reasons why it matches particular information.
our guide to how we manage our programmes (smart rules) and administration (blue book)
the smart rules provide the operating framework for the department for international development’s (dfid’s) programmes.
the blue book (admin only) has been revised and now covers all non-programme elements of dfid’s operating framework (ie human resources, security and estates).
corporate communications
the uk aid logo is designed to help publicly acknowledge that the development programmes we and our partners deliver are funded by uk taxpayers.
staff in dfid and our partner governments and organisations can download the artwork for the uk aid logo and instructions on how and when to use it.
all organisations delivering dfid-funded programmes must use the uk aid logo in accordance with our standards for use.
no other organisation is permitted to use the logo without our permission.

upcoming statistical releases
the release timetable
dfid makes every effort to release its national statistics as soon as possible and in an orderly manner in line with the code of practice for statistics. we publish official statistics on provisional and final uk aid spending normally in spring and autumn in statistics on international development. we also release figures for gross public expenditure on international development after sid.
the timing of these releases is largely determined by the timetable for reporting uk oda figures to the oecd, when the office for national statistics make the latest gni estimates available, and the timing for processing and quality assuring the spending data from dfid, other government departments and other oda contributors.

dfid procurement: current frameworks
dfid terms and conditions of contract
prior to tendering for a dfid contract tendering organisations should ensure that they are able to fully comply with dfid’s dfid standard terms and conditions of contract (pdf, 62.7 mb, 94 pages) , which includes dfid supply partner code of conduct (pdf, 7.45 mb, 16 pages) . these are also available on the supply partner portal.
if you are unable to comply with any of the terms, you should raise a clarification question during the tender process. failure to accept our terms during the tender may invalidate your bid.
dfid’s contract terms and conditions are periodically reviewed to ensure they are reflective of new policy and legislative requirements. please refer to the summary of the august 2018 terms and conditions updates (pdf, 454 kb, 1 page) for a guide to key changes.
dfid policies
dfid has robust policies and processes in place to ensure we obtain maximum impact from uk aid funds. the guidance documents below outline dfid’s internal processes, which we expect organisations to adhere to and have in place, as well as operate similar policies and processes throughout their delivery chain.
what is a day rate? (ms powerpoint presentation, 138 kb)
promoting tax compliance and procurement guidance (pdf, 2.34 mb, 5 pages)
guidance on digital spend advice and controls for dfid partners and supply partners
uk aid branding guidance
dfid security policy for contractors, consultants and supply partners
how dfid pay supply partners
all central government departments are required to pay 90% of undisputed invoices within 5 days. you need to be aware of the correct procedures involved to achieve this.
as part of our purchase to pay policy all invoices must contain a valid purchase order and should be sent directly to accounts payable via our e-invoicing initiative. please see supplier frequently asked questions (pdf, 588 kb, 2 pages) for more information and criteria.
supply partners must send invoices directly to: e-invoicing@dfid.gov.uk
any queries should be directed to: central helpdesk :finopssupplierquery@dfid.gov.uk
for prompt payment statistics please see our dfid payment performance.
paying your subcontractors
where you use sub-contractors for the performance of their contract with dfid, you are required to pay the sub-contractor invoices within 30 days.
on 29 november 2018, oliver dowden, minister for implementation for the cabinet office, announced a new policy which will require bidders (during the selection process) to answer a series of questions about their supply chain management and tracking systems, which will include providing details about payment practices, processes and performance including the percentage of invoices paid within 60 days across both their private and public sector business. supply partners who are unable to demonstrate that they have systems in place that are effective and ensure a fair and responsible approach to payment of their supply chain may be excluded from bidding.
you can read more about this change in an open letter to all current and potential supply partners regarding new measures to ensure 'prompt payment' (pdf, 256 kb, 2 pages).
our commercial vision
dfid commercial vision (ms powerpoint presentation, 338 kb) defines the aims of our organisation and sets out the steps we are taking to achieve this.
annual procurement and commercial report
dfid’s second annual procurement and commercial report meets our commitment from dfid’s supply partner review in october 2017 to place more commercial information in the public domain. it summarises key aspects of dfid’s procurement and commercial performance and that of our strategic supply partners, complementing the information contained in the department’s annual report and accounts. it is accompanied by an open letter to dfid supply partners (pdf, 254 kb, 1 page).
improving opportunities for small and medium enterprises
dfid’s focus on improving its business opportunities, awareness and facilitating sme access to its tenders have generated a consistent growth in sme spend. dfid is fully committed to the long-term government strategy to increase the sme supply base and to ensure inclusivity for organisations that have traditionally found routes to accessing dfid work difficult for a variety of reasons. our new small to medium enterprise action plan (pdf, 801 kb, 17 pages) outlines how we continue to support smes and sets out three main areas of focus:
sme opportunities – improving the visibility and accessibility of our funding opportunities and how we communicate them
continual improvement – applying best practice, supporting compliance and opening up opportunities
sme engagement with dfid and large supply partners – developing a strong market engagement programme, reducing barriers to working with dfid and improving links between smes and our large prime supply partners
for further information sme’s can contact our dedicated sme engagement team via email at smeengagement@dfid.gov.uk.
supply partner compliance
supply partners should refer to our supplier partner handbook (pdf, 565 kb, 30 pages) and supply partner compliance guidance (pdf, 1.47 mb, 17 pages), designed to guide all supply partner(s) through the steps required to respond efficiently and consistently to the code of conduct and to upload the required documentation.
supply partners may also find it helpful to refer to our frequently asked questions (pdf, 450 kb, 32 pages) document where we have set out common code compliance queries and responses from the compliance team.
following feedback (pdf, 5.13 mb, 9 pages) we have reviewed the commercial cost template. we have simplified the commercial cost template (pdf, 1.09 mb, 18 pages) and will tailor where possible to synchronise with the tender it accompanies. there remains simply one separate eligible cost policy (pdf, 1020 kb, 12 pages) that is focused wholly on cost eligibility.
if you have any further questions on our supply partner guidance or any of the supporting documentation, please contact suppliercompliance@dfid.gov.uk
contact us
for further information sme’s can contact our dedicated sme engagement team via email at smeengagement@dfid.gov.uk

the general duty
strategic aims
monitoring equality and diversity in our workforce
we are committed to ensuring that equality remains at the heart of what we do. this includes how we:
design and deliver our policies and services to the public
procure and commission from others
act as an employer
the equality act 2010 extended legal protection to groups with ‘protected characteristics’. the protected characteristics are:
age
disability
gender reassignment
marriage and partnership
pregnancy and maternity
race
religion or belief
sex
sexual orientation
the general duty
the youth justice board for england and wales (yjb) is a public body within the meaning of the act and must therefore pay due regard to the need to:
eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation and other conduct prohibited under the act
advance equality of opportunity between those who share protected characteristics and those who do not
foster good relations between those who share protected characteristics and those who don’t
our specific duty as a public body is to be transparent about how we will demonstrate compliance by publishing one or more equality objectives.
strategic aims
we aim to ensure that yjb staff at all levels reflects the diversity of the society they serve and to ensure our hr practices remain compliant with the equality statement.
you can read how we fulfil our equalities duties, our diversity statement, equalities objectives and planned actions in our yjb public sector equality duty report 2023-24:

privacy notice
coronavirus (covid-19) and your personal information
the government is putting in place a range of extra support and measures to help individuals and businesses affected by coronavirus.
ministry of housing, communities and local government (mhclg) is responsible for implementing some of these measures which may involve changes to the way that your personal information is processed by the department. we may also be asked to share your personal information with other government departments and organisations in order to help provide targeted support to individuals and businesses.
while some of these measures will be carried out quickly due to the evolving nature of the current situation, mhclg will always take appropriate account of the requirement to meet its data protection obligations, as set out in this charter.
the information commissioner’s office has published advice for individuals about how and when organisations can use your personal information during the coronavirus pandemic and how to keep your information safe in the data protection and coronavirus information hub area of its website.
if you have any concerns about how mhclg is handling your personal information, you can email the department’s data protection officer at: dataprotection@communities.gov.uk.
personal information charter and privacy notice
the ministry of housing, communities and local government (mhclg) sometimes needs to process personal information about you so that we can provide services for you, carry out our associated public functions, and comply with applicable laws and regulations. these public functions include:
driving up housing supply
increasing home ownership
devolving powers and budgets to boost local growth in england
supporting strong communities with excellent public services
mhclg knows how important it is to protect your privacy and to comply with data protection legislation and any new laws. as such, we will not give your personal information to anyone, including government departments and their agencies, local authorities, the police or any other public or private sector bodies, unless we have informed you at the point of collection and/or have lawful authority to do so.
our personal information charter explains what you can expect when we ask for, hold, or in any way process your personal information. it also covers:
what we ask of you to help us keep information up to date
how you can request a copy of the personal information we hold about you
how you can report a concern
our standards
the processing of your personalinformation is governed by data protection legislation including the uk general data protection regulation (gdpr), the data protection act 2018 (dpa2018) and other relevant legislation.
when we ask you for personal information, we ensure that you are provided with the information you are entitled to have under law via a concise privacy notice. this will include:
informing you why we need it and what we are going to do with it ensuring we only ask for what we need and don’t collect too much, or irrelevant information
protecting it and ensuring sure nobody has access to it who shouldn’t
informing you of any other recipients or categories of recipients that we will need to share it with when there is an identified need and it is lawful to do so
telling you how long we are keeping it for ensuring we don’t keep it longer than necessary
informing you, where applicable, how to tell us if you object to us processing your information and how to tell us if the information we hold about you is not correct or you want us to erase it
telling you how to ask us what personal information we hold about you
how to contact us and our data protection officer
letting you know how to complain to the information commissioner if you are not satisfied with the way we process your information
in return, we ask you to:
give us accurate information
tell us as soon as possible if there are any changes, such as a new address
this helps us keep your information reliable and up to date.
keeping personal information
we will keep your personal information generally only for as long as is needed to provide you with a service or conduct our business in accordance with our functions and our records management policy as describe in the privacy notice provided to you. however, there may be times when we may need keep it for longer to meet other legislative requirements, or to answer requests for information from ongoing or impending statutory inquiries.
sharing information with others
any personal information you provide will be held securely and processed in accordance with data protection and other relevant legislation. we may disclose your information to other organisations so that we can carry out our functions, or to enable others to perform theirs. generally, you will be informed of this in the privacy notice provided to you. other organisations include, but are not limited to:
other government departments and agencies
local authorities
police and other law enforcement agencies
courts and other judicial bodies
fraud prevention bodies
organisations we appoint to process information on our behalf and under our instruction
mhclg will have a formal agreement in place to ensure that any information about you that we pass to a third party will be processed in accordance with the requirements of the data protection legislation.
how to ask for your personal information
under data protection legislation you have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not personal information concerning you is being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal information and other information about the processing.
in certain circumstances we do not have to give you the information you have asked for. for example, if it relates to preventing or detecting crime.
to ask for personal information held about you by mhclg, please contact the knowledge and information access team using the contact details below.

when you write to us to access your personal information you must provide the following:
confirmation of your identity: a copy of your passport, full driving license or birth certificate (please do not send original documents)
confirmation of name and address: a copy of your full driving license, a copy of a recent utility bill, bank or credit card statement, pension or child benefit book (or similar official document which shows your name and address)
if you are writing on behalf of someone else, a signed declaration from the person you are acting for indicating that they have asked you to make an application on their behalf
if possible, you should also send:
details of all addresses you have used in previous correspondence with mhclg, including email addresses (if applicable) so that we can search our systems
any information that might help us in locating the information in which you are interested (this might include details of any contacts you have had with mhclg at any time, and details of why you think we will hold information about you)
once we receive all the above information, mhclg has one month within which to respond to your request. this may be extended by up to 2 months in complex cases.
mhclg does not keep records of individuals as a matter of routine and if you have had no previous dealings with the department, it is unlikely that we will hold information about you. if, however, you have reason to believe that we do hold information about you, please indicate any contacts or dealings you have had with the department in the past, so that we can locate anything that is relevant.

wycliffe house
water lane
wilmslow
cheshire
sk9 5af
telephone: 030 3123 1113
you can also visit the information commissioner’s office website
further information
below is a general mhclg privacy notice that covers, for example, correspondence that the department has received. for more specific processing a more detailed individual privacy notice will be issued. this privacy notice has been created to be understandable and concise. it does not include exhaustive detail about what information we hold, every organisation mhclg shares information with, how the information is collected or how long all information is kept.
privacy notice
1. the data controller
the ministry of housing, communities and local government (mhclg) is the “data controller”. this means that we are responsible for determining what personal information we collect about you and use, why and how (the ‘purpose and manner’).
2. why we are collecting the data
when we ask for your personal information, we promise only to ask for what we need, and to make sure you know why we need it. if it includes contact details, we will also tell you anything else that we may use it to contact you about and whether you can say no. if you do then say yes to us contacting you about other things, you can withdraw your consent at any time.
sometimes we do not ask for your personal data, but we might obtain it by using dedicated online tools that monitor social media activity in the topic areas of interest to us. social media posts often include publicly available personal data. we anonymise social media data when we share information about online activity found by online listening tools.
3. why we are legally allowed to process your data
the reasons that we can use to collect or use your personal information are set out in law. most of the time, the lawful basis for us processing your personal information under data protection legislation will be because it is necessary for our work as a public body (the processing is necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest - (article 6(1)(e) of the uk general data protection regulation).
when we collect and use your personal information under any other lawful basis, we will let you know which part of data protection law we are using.
4. sharing your data
we will usually let you know if we are going to share your personal data with other organisations. you can ask us for details of agreements we have with other organisations for sharing your information.
if you write to us on a subject that is not our policy area, and the response needs to come from another government department, we will transfer your correspondence, including the personal data, to that department.
sometimes, we may be legally obliged to provide copies of personal information to other organisations. for example, to provide information to the police, or to a public inquiry. we might not be always able to tell you that we have shared your information in this way.
sometimes we may share your personal information with a third party organisation outside of mhclg where we appoint that organisation to process information on our behalf and under our instruction as a ‘data processor’, (e.g. for the purpose of conducting effective analysis of responses to a public consultation exercise). we will ensure that any information that is shared and used in this way will continue to be managed and protected in accordance with strict data protection requirements.
we won’t make your personal information available for commercial use without your specific permission.
we anonymise social media data when we share information about online activity found by online listening tools.
5. keeping your data
we will only keep your personal information as long as we continue to have a lawful basis to do so. this will usually mean that it is still necessary for our work as a public body. this will be decided by our ongoing business need and any laws or government policies that affect how long we keep it. we have a “retention schedule” that sets out how long we will keep different types of information for.
6. your rights
the data we are collecting is your personal data, and you have rights that affect what happens to it. generally, you have the right to:
(a) know that we are using your personal data
(b) see what data we have about you
(c) ask to have your data corrected, and to ask how we check the information we hold is accurate
(d) ask to have your data deleted where the lawful basis for us collecting and using your personal information is the ‘consent’ you have given to that
(e) complain to the information commissioner’s office (see below)
7. sending data overseas
we will not usually send your data overseas. if for some reason we do, such as storing data on computer servers that are not in the uk, we will ensure that all necessary safeguards are in place.
8. automated decision making
we will not normally use your data for any automated decision making. if we need to do so, we will let you know.
9. storage, security and data management
your personal data will be stored securely and will be protected to make sure nobody has access to it who shouldn’t.
you can ask us for details of our instructions to staff on how to collect, use and delete your personal data.
what we ask of you
so that we can keep your personal information reliable and up to date, please:
give us accurate information
tell us as soon as possible if there are any changes, such as a new address
complaints and more information
when we ask you for information, we will keep to the law, including the uk general data protection regulation, the data protection act 2018 and any new legislation coming into force.
if you are unhappy with the way the department has acted, you can make a complaint.
if you are not happy with how we are using your personal information, you should first contact dataprotection@communities.gov.uk.
if you are still not happy, or for independent advice about data protection, privacy and data sharing, you can contact:

we do this by being impartial and increasingly effective and efficient in our administration. we help the honest majority to get their tax right and make it hard for the dishonest minority to cheat the system.
hmrc is a non-ministerial department, supported by 2 agencies and public bodies.

we use a proportion of our core departmental budget to fund project activity to support the policy priorities detailed in our single departmental plan. this funding includes both official development assistance (oda), and non-oda funds, to ensure that we can spent it around the world to promote british interests, including through contributing to the economic development and welfare of developing countries. this small-scale policy programme funding enables us to complement traditional diplomatic activity, respond effectively to changing international situations, and maximise funding from international partners and the private sector. it is used for a wide range of activity designed to protect our people, project our influence and promote our prosperity.
the fco also plays an important role in delivering programmes and projects funded by 2 major government-wide funds, which support the government’s national security strategy, and aid strategy:
the conflict, stability and security fund (cssf), established in 2015, supports work to reduce risk arising from conflict or instability in countries where the uk has important interests
the prosperity fund, established in 2016, promotes the economic reform and development needed for growth in partner countries
we also support:
outstanding scholars with leadership potential to take postgraduate courses in the uk on chevening scholarships
young americans of high ability to study in the uk on marshall scholarships
victims of forced marriage with the domestic programme fund
natural resource management in the overseas territories with the overseas territories environment and climate fund (darwin plus)
prosperity and growth through the science and innovation network
some of the government’s work on international development, including through our activities on promoting sustainable global growth, human rights, climate change and conflict prevention. this is supported by official development assistance funding.

the fco is the uk government department responsible for protecting and promoting british interests around the world, through the fco in london and our network of over 270 diplomatic posts in 168 countries and territories.
find out more about a career in the fco by visiting our pages on the civil service careers website.
we employ a diverse range of talented people capable of delivering to a high standard, often under pressure and sometimes in difficult places. we want the modern fco to reflect the very best of 21st century britain and encourage applications from all suitably qualified applicants irrespective of background or circumstances. our diversity and equality report 2016 includes data on the equality impact of the foreign office’s employment practices and activities.
in return, we guarantee a fascinating, personally rewarding career at the centre of world events. we regularly score highly in surveys of ‘employers graduates would most like to work for’. the civil service has been in the top 10 of the times top 100 graduate employers over the last decade and moved up to 2nd place in the times top 100 graduate employers 2017 to 2018.
our staff
the fco employs around 13,000 staff around the world. roughly a third is made up of uk-based british civil servants whose careers typically include work in the uk and postings overseas; and around two thirds are employed locally by our british diplomatic missions overseas (such as an embassy, high commission, or consulate). applicants for these roles should be based in that country and usually need to be able to work in the main local language. for information on our local staff vacancies, please visit the web page for the country you are interested in working in.
we aim to recruit a diverse workforce - talented people, capable of delivering to a high standard, often under pressure and sometimes in challenging environments. we also offer maternity, adoption or shared parental leave of up to 26 weeks full pay followed by 13 weeks of statutory pay and a further 13 weeks unpaid, and paternity leave of 2 weeks full pay. to learn more about our work, and what you could do, follow us on twitter, facebook or linkedin. to find jobs at the fco, visit the civil service jobs website.
recruitment
recruitment into the fco’s uk-based workforce is normally either as a generalist into the diplomatic or home civil service cadres where staff rotate between a variety of roles, including overseas, or as a specialist (taking up a specific role requiring specialist skills, such as research analysts, lawyers).
all appointments to the fco are made in strict accordance with the key recruitment principles of the civil service commission.
the civil service-wide recruitment freeze introduced in may 2010 limits new appointments to frontline and business-critical jobs only. this has generally restricted fco generalist recruitment permitted under the freeze to the diplomatic service fast stream. we also participate in a number of other fast stream schemes including:
government economic service fast stream
goverment communication service fast stream
digital data technology service fast stream
finance fast stream
commercial fast stream
human resources fast stream
apprenticeships
in contributing to the government’s goal of 3 million apprenticeships by 2020, the fco is committed to developing our apprenticeship programme. in 2018 to 2019, we have recruited apprentices in business administration, communications, human resources, finance (accountancy) and commercial procurement. we recruit apprentices via our own external recruitment and via the government communication service schemes.
current vacancies
all our vacancies are published on the civil service jobs website and can be found by using the ‘organisation’ search engine on the website. we encourage you to visit this site regularly and set up vacancy alerts so that you do not miss our opportunities.
work experience
the fco aims to recruit a talented and diverse workforce which reflects the society we serve. in order to generate interest in fco careers from a broader applicant base, we offer a range of work experience opportunities each year. we hope that by giving individuals from a range of backgrounds the opportunity to sample working at the fco they may consider the fco as a future employer, as well as gaining beneficial work experience.
undertaking work experience or internship with us does not in any way guarantee future employment with the fco or offer any preferential treatment in the selection processes. our recruitment for permanent employment is merit-based in strict accordance with the key recruitment principles of the civil service commission.
we regret that the graduate internship scheme has been cancelled for 2020, due to the unprecedented impact of coronavirus (covid-19) on our operations. we still expect to launch our 2021 scheme next year in the spring. details will be published on this page nearer the time.
alongside our own graduate internship, we offer placements under schemes run by other government departments such as:
civil service fast stream (for graduates)
summer diversity internship programme (for ethnic minority students, disabled students and those from under-represented socio-economic backgrounds)
the application windows for each of the government schemes vary, so you should check the relevant website for further details.
in order to ensure our opportunities are accessible to all those who are eligible, we do not offer any work experience opportunities to individuals on an ad-hoc basis. we do not have the resources to acknowledge or respond to speculative applications.
our work experience opportunities, which are paid, are mainly focused on attracting individuals from backgrounds that are currently under-represented in our workforce, and on those who bring skills which we require to achieve our objectives. all work experience placements are awarded strictly on merit, after a competitive application process.
you can also follow us on twitter, facebook, linked in or sign up to our rss feeds.
international secondments
the uk supports international efforts to prevent violent conflict, to resolve existing conflicts, and to build peace in post-conflict situations.
in support of this, the fco seconds civilian experts and police (serving and retired officers) to international missions run by the european union (eu), united nations (un) and organisation for security and cooperation in europe (osce).
find out more about international secondments with the fco, for serving and retired police, and civilian experts.

natural england’s complaints process has 2 tiers.

we’ll then carry out a full investigation. we aim to send you a full response within 20 working days.
tier 2
if you’re unhappy with the response you received at tier 1, you can request escalation to tier 2 within 30 working days of our response.
at tier 2, your complaint will be escalated to a more senior member of staff for review. it will also be managed by a different person in the natural england complaints team.

if you’re not satisfied
if you’ve been through our complaints process and you’re still not satisfied with the outcome after tier 2, you can:
ask your local mp to refer your complaint to the parliamentary and health service ombudsman within 12 months
refer your complaint to the office for environmental protection (oep) if your complaint relates to natural england’s alleged failure to implement or comply with environmental law
if you refer your complaint to the oep, the timeframe in which you must do this will depend on when it’s alleged that natural england breached environmental law. if it was:
less than 9 months before the date of natural england’s tier 2 response letter, you must make your complaint to the oep within 12 months
more than 9 months ago, you must raise any complaint to the oep within 3 months of the date of natural england’s tier 2 response letter

ability to bank hours in a 12 month period (you can accrue and use 3 days of flexi time per calendar month)
our flexible working arrangements can be affected by the nature of the role, so please ask about the options at interview.

all employees are entitled to 25 days’ leave (pro rata) when they start; this increases to 30 days after 5 years.
in addition to this our people are entitled to 8 bank holidays and you can buy or sell up to 5 additional days each year.
occupational health and sick pay
all staff are entitled to up to 10 months’ paid sick leave (5 months at full pay and 5 months at half pay). staff also have access to occupational health advisers who are able to provide a confidential advice service on health concerns in the workplace.
we value our employees’ health so we also operate an employee assistance programme providing support and advice. the help employee assistance programme (help eap) offers you confidential, independent and unbiased information and guidance on a range of emotional, health and social subject areas; support is for both work related and personal matters. support is available 24 hours, 365 day a year.

work-life balance
we realise the importance of a life outside work and promote a healthy work-life balance for all our staff.
in addition, we understand that many of our staff have young children or other dependents and we endeavor to provide flexible working in line with our policies wherever possible, while ensuring that the needs of the business are met.
in order to provide a flexible way of working for staff, some departments in mhra operate a flexi-time policy. core hours vary across departments depending on the requirements of the business.
learning and development
we are committed to providing learning and development for our staff. as part of this commitment, we provide access to a curriculum of courses that are available in-house or via the civil service learning portal. in addition, staff are able to (with manager’s approval) take up external courses such as degrees, diplomas, or msc courses.
to ensure staff are fully inducted into the agency and are able to perform effectively in their role, there is a three-stage induction programme with an overview of all teams and departments built in, as well as a chance to network with the executive team.
our commitment is also evident in the continued professional development programmes we facilitate each month to continuously boost skills and knowledge, and further develop talent in the agency.
team building
we are committed to improving internal working relationships and communication through all-staff meetings, briefings at divisional meetings and the use of our staff intranet. in addition to this, our open-plan offices encourage communication and interaction between staff.
there are opportunities to join the staff network and have a say in how matters that affect staff are developed and dealt with.
team development days/away days provide a good way for teams to bond whilst working out strategically how the team will meet its objectives. this is a way to celebrate success, spend some time together and support each other with further development.

rail accident investigation branch
about us
the rail accident investigation branch (raib) independently investigates accidents to improve railway safety, and inform the industry and the public.

corporate information
who we are
lord cullen’s inquiry report on the ladbroke grove rail accident in 1999 recommended the creation of an organisation to independently investigate railway accidents to improve safety. raib became operational in october 2005 as the independent body for investigating accidents and incidents on mainline railways, metros, tramways and heritage railways throughout the uk.
we employ inspectors and principal inspectors with either a professional railway or investigation background. we have given them extensive training in railway operations, railway engineering and investigation skills. including the inspectors and the team who provide essential business support, we have a total staff of 43 people.
we’re based in operational centres in derby and farnborough. having two centres means we can respond quicker to accidents in any part of the uk.
our investigations are focused solely on improving safety. we are not a prosecuting body and do not apportion blame or liability. possible breaches of legislation are dealt with by other organisations, usually the police and safety authorities.
we are totally independent and our chief inspector reports the outcomes of investigations to the secretary of state for transport. an introduction to the raib
our responsibilities
we’re responsible for:
investigating the causes of railway accidents and incidents where we believe our investigation will bring safety learning to the industry
identifying the factors that may lead to a similar accident or make the consequences worse
highlighting gaps in the railway industry’s safety defences that are revealed during our investigations
making recommendations to prevent the same thing happening again
increasing awareness of how railway accidents happen
co-operating with other investigation organisations nationally and internationally to share and encourage good practice.
whenever we investigate, we publish the results as an investigation report. we also produce safety digests, which highlight learning points which have emerged from our preliminary examination of an event.
raib’s scope
raib investigates accidents and incidents which occur on the uk main line networks (network rail and northern ireland railways), london underground, other metro systems, tramways, heritage railways and the uk part of the channel tunnel. operators of these types of railway and tramway have a duty under the law to notify raib of some types of accidents and incidents. some operations that may seem to be related to railways are not actually within the scope of our powers. locations and systems which are wholly or partly out of scope include:
self-contained railways entirely on private land which do not cross a carriageway (by a level crossing, bridge or tunnel)
industrial railway systems (including docks)
museums
funfairs
cliff lifts
we have published full guidance on our scope, as well as guidance on the types of event which are required to be notified to us.
we monitor operations on the major networks through various industry reporting systems. we have the legal power and the discretion to decide to investigate any event that occurs on a system that is within our scope, not just those that have to be notified to us.
some events on the main line railways that result in death or serious injury will not be investigated by raib (and in some cases they do not have to be notified to us). there are two main reasons why this may happen. in many cases, from the information available at the time, it appears that the person concerned has deliberately trespassed or otherwise put themselves in harm’s way. sometimes we are satisfied, after making enquiries, that although an accidental sequence of events has resulted in tragic consequences, there are no safety lessons to be learned, and so we will not investigate further.
raib’s response to notifications
on being notified of an accident or incident, our normal approach is to obtain sufficient information to decide how to respond.
our legal basis
uk legislation
the railways and transport safety act 2003(the 2003 act) established the rail accident investigation branch (raib), and section 8 of the act provides the powers that our inspectors use during their investigations. we have published guidance to assist with using the act.
the railways (accident investigation and reporting) regulations 2005 (si1992)(the 2005 regulations) set out the details of the raib’s duties, the scope of our work and our dealings with other people and organisations involved in rail accidents. we have published guidance to assist with using the regulations.
the regulations came into force for mainland uk on 17 october 2005 and the raib became operational on that date. operations were further extended to cover the channel tunnel from 31 january 2006.
eu legislation
since 2004, the railway safety directive (2004/49/eu) and its subsequent amendment in 2008 has created a european framework for safety management. the aim of this common approach was to ensure the development and improvement of safety and create a single market for european rail transport.
the directive aims to provide a means for ensuring that serious railway accidents and incidents are independently investigated in a blame-free manner, with a published report which identifies causes and makes recommendations to improve the safety of the railway and prevent future accidents and incidents.
the directive requires every member state to establish a national safety authority, which is the office of rail and road in great britain, and a national investigating body (nib) (the raib in the uk). the european railway agency, set up in 2004, helping rail organisations work together to produce a common framework for safety in europe. this includes establishing a network of the member states’ nib’s to share and promote best practices.
each nib is required to be entirely independent in its organisation, legal structure and decision-making from any other party or body. it must also be functionally independent from the safety authority and from any regulator of railways.
the directive was transposed into uk legislation by the 2003 act and the 2005 regulations. we are currently working to revise and update the regulations in the light of new legislation and eleven years’ operating experience.
the role of other organisations
the safety of the uk’s railway industry is heavily reliant on the quality of the relationships with a number of different organisations
our mission and ambitions
we independently investigate accidents to improve railway safety, and inform the industry and the public.
the raib will:
undertake high quality investigations safely and in a timely manner
publish safety learning in a manner that adds value to industry’s management of risk
have a culture of integrity, honesty, objectivity, impartiality, trust, respect and empathy
have an environment that actively encourages and facilitates staff development
the raib and its staff will:
be well-respected within industry and considered to be world class accident investigators
interact with others, inside and outside the organisation in a positive, sensitive, inclusive and efficient manner
adapt to changes in industry, technology and society

our policy responsibilities cover product safety, legal metrology (weights and measures), standards and accreditation, hallmarking, and primary authority.
we are the enforcement authority for a range of product regulations where other government departments hold policy responsibility, extending to construction products for mhclg, energy standards for desnz, environmental regulations for defra, electric vehicle charging points for dft, and consumer connectable product security for dsit. we also work with fcdo in partner countries to support the development of regulatory environments that enable international trade.

how accessible are our statistics
we are committed to making our statistical outputs accessible. we have reviewed our statistical outputs and for the large majority of our statistical series, the most recent publication includes accessible versions of all outputs, in line with the public sector bodies (websites and mobile applications) accessibility regulations 2018 (the “accessibility regulations”) . there are a small number of statistical series where the elements of the latest release are not fully accessible. in particular, some of our spreadsheets may not be clearly structured with labelled tables, and labelled headings. columns headings may be blank. workbooks tabs may not have a clear title. this does not meet success criterion 1.3.1 (info and relationships) .
we are working on these remaining series and will ensure that accessible versions of the latest releases are available by the end of 2022 at the latest.
in accordance with the accessibility regulations, we have assessed the impact of making all statistics published between 23 september 2018 and 23 september 2020 fully accessible. this was deemed to be a disproportionate burden for the following reasons:
beis published around 350 statistical publications in the period 23 september 2018 to 22 september 2020. the majority of these publications are not fully accessible. making all publications fully accessible would have large resource implications, which would significantly impact on our ability to meet the current statistical needs of our users.
users of routine regular statistics bulletins should only access the most recently published iteration, which may include revisions, methodological improvements and changes, and incorporates retrospection. the latest iteration thus generally supersedes all earlier iterations.
google analytics evidence demonstrates that usage is high for the most recent iteration only, falling to negligible levels after the release of subsequent iterations, so actual usage does not support a need to proactively reproduce earlier iterations. for ad hoc releases the same trend is observed, indicating ad hocs are of primary interest close to the time of release, and this interest does not persist.
in line with the accessibility regulations, we will provide a specific statistical publication in a different format if requested.
the equality and human rights commission (in great britain) and the equality commission for northern ireland (in northern ireland) are responsible for enforcing the accessibility regulations. if you are unsatisfied with your response from beis, you may contact the equality advisory and support service or the equality commission for northern ireland.
corporate procedures and standards
we produce national and official statistics in accordance with the guidance provided in the code of practice for statistics. details on how we do this are set out in the documents below.
beis statement of compliance with the pre-release access to official statistics order 2008
beis statistical public engagement and data standards
beis statistical revisions policy
archived statistics
gov.uk offers the most recent statistics beis has published. this includes statistics previously published by the department for business innovation and skills (bis) and the department of energy and climate change (decc) (both now closed).
earlier versions of the former department for business, innovation and skills website and the associated historic publications are available from the national archives.

we do this by being impartial and increasingly effective and efficient in our administration. we help the honest majority to get their tax right and make it hard for the dishonest minority to cheat the system.

your privacy
personal information supplied by you as part of our statutory functions
holding this information enables us to fulfil our statutory duties, serve customers and meet our obligations as an employer.
the data protection act 2018 (dpa) provides the statutory framework in relation to personal information.
the freedom of information act 2000 and environmental information regulations 2004 govern what other information we may give in response to a request for information.
when we handle personal information supplied by you as part of our statutory functions, your rights under the dpa are limited. the dpa permits us to use personal information for these purposes.
personal information held outside our statutory purposes
when you supply personal information for purposes outside of our statutory obligations and duties, we will:
make sure you know why we need it
ask only for what we need
protect it and ensure that access to it is restricted
let you know if we share it with other organisations (unless it is shared for law enforcement purposes)
make sure we do not keep it longer than necessary
in return, we ask you to:
give us accurate information
tell us as soon as possible if there are any changes
information we collect
web services
when someone uses our web services, we collect standard internet log information and details of visitor behaviour patterns. we collect this information in a way which does not identify anyone. we do not make any attempt to find out the identities of those visiting our web services.
we publish our corporate information and guidance on gov.uk.
we will not associate any data gathered from the site with any personally identifying information from any other source. if we do want to collect personally identifying information through our web services, we will make this clear.
the contact information we hold may be used to contact customers when appropriate. users may opt out of further communication if they choose.
our web applications use forms for customers to submit information. we may collect contact information such as email addresses and financial information in relation to the setting of business rates.
customer contact centre
when you call our customer contact centre we collect information, such as names and contact details. we use this information to help improve our efficiency and effectiveness. the information is recorded within our customer contact systems. telephone calls are recorded for quality assurance purposes.
complaints
when we receive a complaint from a person we make up a file containing the details of the complaint. this normally contains the identity of the complainant and any other individuals involved in the complaint.
we will only use the personal information we collect to process the complaint and to check on the level of service we provide. we do compile and publish statistics but not in a form which identifies anyone.
we usually have to disclose the complainant’s identity to whoever the complaint is about. this is inevitable where, for example, the accuracy of a valuation is in dispute. if a complainant doesn’t want information identifying him or her to be disclosed, we will, in exceptional circumstances try to respect that but it will not usually be possible to handle a complaint on an anonymous basis.
we will keep personal information contained in complaint files in line with our retention policy for a period of 6 years. our document disposal policy and list is available on request. it will be retained in a secure environment and access to it will be restricted according to the ‘need to know’ principle.
similarly, where enquiries are submitted to us we will only use the information supplied to us to deal with the enquiry and any subsequent issues and to check on the level of service we provide.
usually we do not identify any complainants unless the details have already been made public.
our services
to provide our services we have to hold users’ details and we may use this information for other related purposes, eg to carry out a survey.
for some of our services the terms and conditions set out what we may do with your information.
contacting customers as part of rating list maintenance
as part of our statutory duty to maintain the rating list, we may need to contact customers to obtain missing facts about a non-domestic property. if we do not hold an email address or telephone number and cannot obtain this information through other sources, we may need to use an internet search or social media to find publicly available business details, which we can then use to contact the customer. this information will only be used for this purpose.
job applicants and employees
if you apply to work for us we will only use your information to process your application and monitor our recruitment statistics.
when we need to disclose information to a third party, for example where we want to take up a reference, we will let you know beforehand, unless the disclosure is required by law.
once a person has taken up employment with the valuation office agency, we will compile a file relating to their employment.
complaints or queries
we try to meet the highest standards when collecting and using personal information and we take any complaints we receive about this very seriously.
you can make a complaint if you think our collection or use of information is inaccurate, unfair or misleading.
we also welcome any suggestions for improving our procedures.
access to personal information
you can make a ‘subject access request’ under the data protection act 2018 to find out if we hold your personal information.
if we hold information about you we will:
give you a description of it
tell you why we are holding it
tell you who it could be disclosed to
let you have a copy of the information in an intelligible form
there are exceptions under the dpa and, if these apply, we may not necessarily provide you with information requested.
how we use your information
we will not disclose, share or use personal data without consent unless it is within our own internal departments or with:
other government departments and agencies
law enforcement and regulatory agencies
other relevant bodies
we may share information with third parties
if false or inaccurate information is provided
if it is in the public interest
for the prevention and detection and investigation of crime, including registration fraud
information that relates to fraud is shared with the police for:
protecting life and property
preserving order
preventing the commission of offences
bringing offenders to justice
any duty or responsibility of the police arising from common or statute law
we follow the information commissioner’s ‘data sharing code of practice’ where possible.
we access and use information disclosed to counter fraud organisations to prevent fraud and money laundering.
freedom of information
we may disclose information without obtaining your consent to comply with legislation, including the freedom of information act 2000 and environmental information regulations 2004, or an order of court.
protecting your information
we acknowledge that your trust and privacy is important. we are committed to protecting the information you provide us. to prevent unauthorised access, maintain accuracy and ensure proper use of information, we have physical, electronic and managerial processes to safeguard and secure the information we collect.
contact us
to make a subject access request for personal information held about you, you can email us at subjectaccessrequests@voa.gov.uk.
if you have difficulty contacting us by email, you can call the voa on 03000 501501 (england) or 03000 505505 (wales).
for independent advice about data protection, privacy and data-sharing issues, you can contact the information commissioner’s office.

nuclear decommissioning authority
about us
we're charged, on behalf of government, with the mission to clean-up the uk’s earliest nuclear sites safely, securely and cost effectively.

corporate information
we’re committed to overcoming the challenges of nuclear clean-up and decommissioning, leaving the 17 nuclear sites ready for their next use.
we do this work with care for our people, communities and the environment, with safety, as always, our number one priority.
nuclear decommissioning authority: our uk mission
what we do
as owners of one of the largest nuclear decommissioning and remediation programmes in europe, our main priority is to lead the work across the nda group and develop the strategy for how it should be carried out. we also play an important role in supporting government’s aspiration for the uk to be a global leader in the civil nuclear sector.
our strategy is continually evolving and is updated every five years.
we strive to deliver best value for the uk taxpayer by focusing on reducing the highest hazards and risks, while ensuring safe, secure, and environmentally responsible operations at our sites.
we seek ways to reduce the level of public funding from government by generating revenue through our commercial activities.
how we’re set up
we’re a non-departmental public body created by the energy act 2004 to lead the clean-up and decommissioning work at our 17 sites on behalf of government.
we’re sponsored and funded by the department for energy, security and net zero (desnz). our plans for cleaning up the sites are approved by desnz and scottish ministers, who provide a framework for us.
we have offices across the uk, in cumbria, warrington, dounreay, harwell and london and employ just over 380 permanent staff.
as a non-departmental public body, the nda supports a wide range of government policy developments such as the nuclear sector deal and the ten point plan for a green industrial revolution with intellectual thought, physical assets and research and development.
our sites
the uk’s nuclear landscape began to take shape in the post-war period and has evolved over many decades. the focus during the cold war arms race was on producing material for britain’s nuclear deterrent. when the nation’s priorities shifted, facilities were turned into nuclear power stations, and, from 1956 onwards, the uk’s first nuclear power stations began generating electricity for homes and businesses. fuel fabrication and reprocessing plants were built from the 1970s to 1990s.
our 17 sites reflect this legacy and include the first fleet of nuclear power stations, research centres, fuel-related facilities, and sellafield, which has the largest radioactive inventory and the most complex facilities to decommission.
current plans indicate it will take more than 100 years to complete our core mission of nuclear clean-up and waste management. the goal is to achieve the end state at all sites by 2380.
uk map of sites (png, 155 kb)
the nda group
decommissioning the uk’s nuclear legacy is a complex undertaking and relies on the full range of expertise and skills within the nda group. over the last few years we’ve brought together the organisations involved in delivering our mission to decommission the uk’s legacy sites and facilities into one group, as nda subsidiary operating companies. we’ve also taken steps to join some of our subsidiary operating companies, reducing the number of organisations and boards.
the nda group is now made up of the nda and its four key component parts:
sellafield
nuclear restoration services
nuclear waste services
nuclear transport solutions.
our other subsidiaries include rutherford indemnity, nda archives, nda properties and energus.
the scope of the nda group is set to grow, following arrangements agreed by the uk government and edf for decommissioning britain’s seven advanced gas-cooled reactors (agrs).
the agrs will reach the end of their operational lives over the next 10 years and as they come offline their ownership will transfer to the nda for decommissioning, utilising the expertise of our group and significantly nuclear restoration services and its experience in decommissioning the older stations.
our strategic approach and themes
our strategic themes
we use five strategic themes to describe all the activities needed to deliver the nda’s mission.
the first four strategic themes, spent fuels, nuclear materials, integrated waste management and site decommissioning and remediation relate directly to our clean-up and decommissioning work and are known as driving themes.
the fifth theme describes the important activities needed to support the delivery of our mission and is known as critical enablers.
currently, the most urgent task is dealing with our sites’ highest-hazard materials, spent fuel, nuclear materials and highly-radioactive wastes.
once the inventory has been made safe, the redundant nuclear facilities can be dismantled and demolished.
the integration of the nda strategic themes (jpeg, 1.27 mb)
our driving themes and strategic outcomes
across our four driving themes, we break our mission down into 47 strategic outcomes. these outcomes represent the significant pieces of work that have to be achieved to deliver our mission.
increasingly, we’re building a more accurate picture of the work that’s been completed across our 47 outcomes and that which is still left to do.
see our priorities and progress page for a more in depth look at how we’re performing against these strategic outcomes and our mission.

there are a variety of ways members of the public can obtain information from the ministry of defence. some information is released proactively and can be accessed through this website, while other categories of information are only available on request. if you need information in an alternative format, we will do all we reasonably can to help.
our publication scheme follows the information commissioner’s model publication scheme for public authorities. it covers the following parts of the mod:

all of the information is set into ‘classes’. these classes are:

lists and registers: information held in registers required by law and other lists and registers relating to the functions of the authority
the services we offer: advice and guidance, booklets and leaflets, transactions and media releases
although our aims is to be as open as possible, we will not publish information that is:
protected from disclosure
in draft form
no longer readily available
archived information previously on www.mod.uk is available from national archives.
mod foi publication scheme guide to information
the mod foi publication scheme guide to information is presently being reviewed and will be updated in due course. the information commissioner’s office (ico) definition documents the scheme will be based on are:
definition document for the armed forces of the crown (excluding any special forces)
definition document for government departments
definition document for police authorities
definition document for non departmental public bodies
charging policy for information
the department publishes most information online, where it is available for you to view free of charge. if you do not have access to the internet, a printed copy of the web page(s) can be sent to you free of charge.
the following may incur a charge:
requests for multiple copies
request for the information in a different format
requests for archived documents that are no longer available on our website
any charges made will be to cover the costs of photocopying, postage and packing. you will be told in advance of supplying the information if there will be a charge, and how much it will be.
transparency
transparency is about bringing the operation of government into the open and is key to the coalition government’s vision for how public services should be delivered so that everyone can see whether this is good value for money. through transparency the government is aiming to:
promote social and economic growth
drive improved service delivery
and increase the accountability of public services
over the next two years mod will build on the progress made to date, and subject to operational and resource constraints, seek to embed transparency as normal business.
mod datasets
information not already published
if you cannot find what you want through this scheme, or otherwise on our website, you may wish to make a request to us under the foi act or the environmental information regulations 2004 (eir).
how to make an official request for information
before making a request it is worth checking to see if the information is already available in foi releases, publications and/or is pre-may 2010 so will be archived material that is available from the national archives. if you cannot find the information you require after searching these areas, you may have to submit a request for information. this must be submitted in writing.
submit your foi request
alternatively, send a letter to:
mod information rights team
ground floor, zone d
main building
whitehall
london sw1a 2hb
this must include:
your name (title, first name and surname)
a postal address and or email address for reply
a description of the information required (please be as specific as possible)
we will deal with your request as quickly as we can, and will aim to let you have a response within 20 working days. if for any reason we are unable to let you have a response within 20 working days we will contact you as soon as possible explaining the reason for this.
email: cio-foi@mod.gov.uk
requests for personal data and service records
if the request is to obtain information about yourself or service records please click here.
personal data is not generally available under the freedom of information act.
disclosure on request
provided the information requested is not exempt from disclosure, for example, the information may be withheld to protect personal privacy, national security or commercial interests, our aim is to be as open as possible.
how to complain if you are unhappy with the handling of your requests
if you are dissatisfied with any aspect of the reply to your request for information or the way it was handled, you have the right to complain,. before doing so you might like to consider whether less formal action might provide the remedy you seek. for example, if you require clarification of some aspects of the information you received, the person who dealt with your request will probably be best able to help you. however, if you do wish to complain there are two stages to this process:
the information rights compliance team will conduct an independent internal review of the way your request was handled. you can contact the information rights compliance team by writing to:
information rights compliance team, ground floor, zone d whitehall, sw1a 2hb
email: cio-foi@mod.gov.uk
if you remain dissatisfied following an internal review, you may take your complaint to the information commissioner under the provisions of section 50 of the freedom of information act. please note that the information commissioner will not normally investigate your case until you have exhausted the use of the mod’s internal complaints procedure. further details of the role and powers of the information commissioner can be found on the commissioner’s website.
please see the mod foi and eir complaints and appeals procedure for a full description of the official appeals procedure

national citizen service
national citizen service
national citizen service has closed
the national citizen service trust worked to empower young people as part of the government’s national youth guarantee.
the national citizen service (ncs) was founded in 2009 and granted royal charter body status in 2018. it provided opportunities for 16 to 17 year olds in england to build confidence, develop key skills, and prepare for the world of work through residential trips, community-based projects, and online experiences. ncs delivered almost one and a half million experiences to young people, and through ncs, young people completed more than 18 million hours of volunteering and social action. over 80% of young people who took part in the ncs programme said they gained valuable skills for the future and 70% agreed that ncs fostered respect for diversity.
the national citizen service programme concluded on 31 march 2025 and the national citizen service trust will be closed in due course.
view the closed national citizen service site in the uk government web archive.
please note that the ncs trust website is no longer operational and social media is no longer monitored. these will shortly be closed down.

how we work
who we are
business integrity
corporate information
we are the uk’s export credit agency and a government department, working alongside the department for business and trade as an integral part of its strategy and operations.
we work with over 100 private credit insurers and lenders to help uk companies access export finance (the particular class of loans, insurance policies or bank guarantees that enable international trade to take place as easily and securely as possible). we exist to complement not compete with the private sector.
we help uk companies to:
win export contracts by providing attractive financing terms to their buyers
fulfil contracts by supporting working capital loans
get paid by insuring against buyer default
we can support exports for any size of company and across all sectors, from capital goods to services and intangibles such as intellectual property.
how we work
our export finance managers provide free and impartial consultations. they help uk companies to check they are getting the appropriate support and, if not, explore how to bridge any gaps.
arrange a consultation with your local export finance manager.
find out more about our products and read our success stories, describing real-life examples of our support.
who we are
we employ more than 450 staff. our office is in london, but our network of export finance managers are located across the uk. they are the first point of contact for guidance for uk exporters of all sizes and in all sectors.
we are supported by an advisory non-departmental body.
read our 2024 to 2029 business plan.
uk export finance is the operating name of the export credits guarantee department (ecgd).
you can also read relevant legislation: the export and investment guarantees act 1991, as amended by the industry and exports (financial support) act 2009 and the small business enterprise and employment act 2015.
business integrity
uk companies that do business with integrity are better positioned to reduce risks and capitalise on commercial opportunities.
doing business with integrity means ensuring compliance with the uk bribery act and insisting local partners, agents and distributors adhere to the same high standards. it also means being vigilant for modern slavery and other human rights abuses, both in operations and supply chains, in line with the uk modern slavery act 2015.
companies that make integrity core to their business protect and strengthen brand reputation, enjoy greater and more sustainable commercial success over the long-term, and minimise the risk of prosecution.
the relationship between business integrity and commercial success
tackling bribery and corruption creates more prosperous and healthy communities and a better business environment. it also enables the uk to maintain its status as a global leader in the fight against corruption.

overview
we carry out driving tests, approve people to be driving instructors and mot testers, carry out tests to make sure lorries and buses are safe to drive, carry out roadside checks on drivers and vehicles, and monitor vehicle recalls.
find out more about the services we provide.
we are an executive agency of the department for transport (dft). the data controller for dvsa is dft – a data controller determines the reasons and how personal data is processed. for more information, see the information commissioner’s office (ico) data protection public register. dft’s registration number is z7122992.
so that you can use these services, we need to collect, use, store and sometimes share your personal information.
what personal data is
personal data is information that can identify a living person. it lets you identify them either:
directly, for example, their name
indirectly, for example, their driving licence number
personal data can include things such as:
names
identification numbers
location data
online usernames or id
data about health, genetics, economics, culture, social identity or ethnicity
your personal data is protected by law. it protects how it is collected, used and stored.
when we need your data
when we need to collect, store or use your personal data, we will:
have a good reason to do it and only ask for what we need
do so in a fair and transparent way
tell you why we need your information and how we’ll use it
only use your information how we say we’ll use it, and not in a way you would not expect without asking/telling you first
only keep what we need, and will not keep it for longer than we need
make sure it’s accurate and up to date, and that nobody has access to it who should not
keep it safe and secure
if you use one of our websites, we will share anonymised data with gov.uk and the government digital service on how you used the site. this will usually be via google analytics.
give us accurate data and tell us when things change
make sure the data you give us is accurate and let us know if it changes. for example, if you change your:
name
address
telephone number
if your data is not correct, if could have an impact on you, for example, communications from us may go to your previous address or email address or if you pass your test your driving licence may go to a previous address
your sensitive (special category) data
we follow extra rules when we collect, use and store more sensitive personal data. this is called ‘special category’ data. it includes things like race, ethnic origin, trade union membership, health and sexual orientation.
criminal data
when we process personal data to enforce criminal law, we categorise individuals so that their role is clear, for example, witness, victim, suspect or convicted criminal.
we record whether the information is opinion or fact, and keep detailed logs of how we handle the data.
we may include your personal data in press releases following successful prosecutions.
we may also process criminal data during the recruitment process. we will only seek this information once a job offer has been made to you and we will inform you that we are doing so.
reasons we can process your personal data
we can only process personal data for one or more of the following reasons:
you’ve freely given your consent, it’s clear what you’re consenting to, and how you can withdraw your consent
you’ve entered (or intend to enter) into a contract with us
for legal reasons
to protect someone’s ‘vital interests’ (a matter of life or death)
to perform a public task or perform a specific task that’s in the public interest
for our own or a third party’s legitimate interests - but only where the personal data is going to be used in ways that are reasonably expected and are not intrusive, or where there are compelling reasons to process it
these reasons are sometimes called ‘lawful bases’.
the reason we process your personal data affects the rights you have over it. we process data to meet our legal obligations and to perform public tasks.
your rights over your personal data
by law, you have the right to:
access your data - you can access your personal data free of charge and in any format
be informed - you should know and understand what happens with your data and why
be forgotten - without a ‘compelling reason’ to keep your data, we must delete it
move your data - you can obtain and reuse your personal data with other services
limit how your data is used - you can block and put restrictions on how your data’s used, if it’s inaccurate or unnecessary
say no - you can stop direct marketing and data processing when there’s no ‘compelling reason’ to do it
make changes to your data - you can update any data about you that’s out of date or false, without delay
human-made decision making - you can stop automated decisions being made about you, if it has legal or significant consequences
we aim to respond to your request within one month. we can take up to 3 months to respond if your request is complex. we’ll contact you within the first month to let you know if it’s going to take longer than one month.
we cannot respond to requests made by online portals unless we’re able to verify your identity.
contact our data protection team to use any of these rights.
dvsa data protection
dataprotection@dvsa.gov.uk
freedom of information and environmental information regulations
when you request information under freedom of information rules or the environmental information regulations, we may need to consult with other departments to give you a coordinated response.
if your request should have been sent to another organisation, we’ll reply and tell you who to send it to. we will not send your request to the other organisation for you.
sometimes we need to share your request for information with other organisations who help us run our services. we will not share any information that identifies you unless it is necessary to do so.
we keep a record of your request for 2 years. we only keep it for longer if it’s necessary because of an ongoing issue.
forms
if you fill in an online or paper application form, there will usually be a separate privacy notice with the form.
where a privacy notice has not yet been added to the form, we still follow all the rules and processes set out in this personal information charter to keep your personal data safe and secure.
emails and letters
when you write to us, we’ll use your personal data to look into the issue you’ve raised and send you a reply.
we usually keep a record of your email or letter for 2 years. we do keep some for longer if the service or system has a policy that says it has to be kept for longer.
if your email or letter is about something another government department or agency is responsible for, we will usually pass it to them to reply to you or tell you where to send it.
telephone calls
if you call our customer service centre, we record the call:
for monitoring and training purposes
to improve customer service in the future
we keep the recording for 6 months.
if you called before 16 december 2024, we keep the recording for one year. the difference is because we reviewed the length of time we keep recordings.
we may keep a recording for longer if needed, for example as part of an ongoing complaint or investigation.
webchat
when you contact us using webchat, you will be asked to provide your name and email address so that we can respond to you and send you a transcript of our chat, if you ask us for one.
we will not ask you for any other personal data. no other personal data will be collected unless you voluntarily include it as part of the web chat itself.
our legal basis for processing your name, email address and the content of our webchat is public task. we will keep a copy of the transcript on our uk, cloud-based platform for 30 calendar days. we will only share a copy of this data with you (if you ask for it), and we may review webchats for training, monitoring and service improvement purposes.
distribution lists
we keep a number of distribution lists to communicate with our stakeholders as part of our functions as a government agency, where you have given your consent or for legitimate interests.
each list is only used for the purpose that the individuals on the list were told about at the time we collected their information or that you gave your consent for.
we provide an email alert service that lets you choose what updates to get. you can manage your preferences and subscribe at any time.
there’s a separate privacy notice for this service.
research
to design services that are easy to use and valued by the people who need them, we need to understand their circumstances, influences and expectations. research helps us understand this and whether the changes we make improve road safety.
the nature of the research determines what personal data is collected about you. when the research project has finished, we remove or anonymise all personal data from the records.
we publish the results of research on gov.uk, but we make sure you cannot be identified in it.
when we do a research project, you’ll be told about its purpose, what personal data we collect about you, if it will be shared with any other organisation and if it will be combined with other data.
we will:
ask for your consent to be part of a research project
tell you which lawful bases we’re relying on for our research, for example, public task or consent
email research2@dvsa.gov.uk if you do not want to take part in research, or if you originally said you wanted to, but have changed your mind and want to stop.
if we do not carry out the research directly ourselves, we’ll share your personal data with research companies we have a contract with to do research for us.
when we share your data
we may share personal data within our organisation or with other bodies where we are permitted to do so by law.
there are some cases where we can pass on your data without telling you - for example, to prevent or detect crime, or in order to produce anonymised statistics.
in all cases, whether data is shared internally or externally, we will be governed by data protection law.
public records
a small proportion of our records are transferred to the national archives, in line with legal obligations for the collection, disposal and preservation of records.
the public records act sets out which records are selected, transferred and preserved. records defined as ‘public records’ must be openly accessible, unless they’re exempt under the freedom of information act.
children’s privacy protection
our services are not designed for, or intentionally targeted at, children 13 years of age or younger. we do not intentionally collect or maintain data about anyone under the age of 13.
what we do to keep your data safe and secure
when we introduce new technology or new policies and processes, we consider your privacy from the start. we’ll carry out a data protection impact assessment (dpia) when it will help.
we always carry out a dpia when we:
use new technologies
consider there is a high risk to your rights and freedoms
if a risk is found and we cannot find a way to reduce the impact or likelihood of the risk happening, we’ll ask the department for transport (as the department that oversees us) and the information commissioner for advice.
you can request a copy of any dpia we’ve carried out by emailing pia@dvsa.gov.uk.
how we keep your data secure
we protect your personal data from unauthorised access, accidental loss, destruction and damage.
we carry out regular reviews and audits to make sure the way we collect, use and store personal data meets government security standards.
we also arrange for it health checks and penetration testing to be carried out on our systems. this is done by independent check approved individuals. these people:
have a contract with us
may have access to your personal data
must follow our policy on the acceptable use of it and communications equipment - they agree to do this before they carry out any work
we only transfer your personal data overseas if there are appropriate safeguards in place to protect it.
we will test changes to our systems using dummy data. where this is not possible, we will look at other options. if the only option is to test using your personal data, we shall:
ensure the system has had an it health check and any risks have been identified and addressed to a tolerable level
seek approval from relevant senior staff within dvsa
only test with the minimum amount of your personal data
only use dvsa staff or contracted supplier staff to test with live data and consider whether they need enhanced security clearance before doing so
securely remove your data from testing as soon as it has been completed
training and guidance we give to our staff
we train all our staff about the importance of protecting personal and other sensitive data.
anyone who routinely accesses personal data as part of their job has to do more in-depth training. anyone with access to large volumes of personal data has to carry out training tailored to their role.
our managers with formal responsibility for large datasets take extra training. this makes sure they have a clear understanding of what they need to do to keep the data under their control safe and secure.
all civil servants have to follow the civil service code. this has 4 core values of integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality. these values apply to how we handle personal data.
data breach notification
we do everything we can to keep your personal data secure.
we’ll tell the information commissioner’s office straight away (and always within 72 hours) if we become aware of a data breach. we’ll do this if the breach creates a risk to your rights and freedoms, including:
financial loss
breach of confidentiality
discrimination
damage to your reputation
significant social or economic damage
we’ll tell you straight away if we think there’s a high risk to you. we will:
give you our data protection manager’s contact details
explain the likely consequences of the breach
tell you what measures we’ve taken or plan to address the breach, including any steps taken to limit potential damaging effects
if we cannot contact you directly, we’ll try to make you aware through other means, such as a public announcement.
complain about how we’ve handled your data
if you believe your data has been misused, you can write to our data protection manager to complain about the way we’ve handled your personal data.
dvsa data protection manager

email information.handling@dvsa.gov.uk
we’ll send you a full response within 10 working days. if we cannot respond fully in that time, we’ll tell you why and let you know when we can respond in full.
contact dvsa customer services if you have a query that is not about how your personal data is used.
if you want to complain about our response
complain to the information commissioner if you’re not happy with the way we responded to your complaint about how we handled your data. they provide independent advice about data protection, privacy and data sharing issues.
privacy notices for our services and activities
each of our services and activities has a privacy notice. it tells you:
what personal data is collected, used and stored
how long the data is stored for
why the personal data is collected
how the personal data is used including who it’ll be shared with, if applicable
whether your data will be transferred or accessed outside of the uk, and what legal protection it will have, if applicable
most of our online services have a privacy notice link at the bottom of the service’s pages. you can use it to read the privacy notice for that service.
if an online service does not yet have a privacy notice link at the bottom of its pages, you can find it on the list of dvsa privacy notices.
you can also find privacy notices for our other activities on the list of dvsa privacy notices.

equality objectives 2023 to 2025
as an employer, dwp is committed to the civil service ambition to become the uk’s most inclusive employer and we will continue to:
increase the representation of currently under-represented groups to make dwp more diverse
build an inclusive environment, where colleagues are able to be themselves at work and feel supported, empowered, valued, respected, fairly treated and able to achieve their full potential
our goal is to ensure that these commitments, reinforced by our values, are embedded in our day-to-day working practices with all our customers, colleagues and partners.
as an inclusive employer we will not tolerate discrimination. our hr policies are fully inclusive of all staff regardless of:
age
working-pattern
disability or long term health conditions
sex
sexual orientation
pregnancy and maternity
race
ethnicity
nationality
religion or belief
gender identity expression or reassignment
relationship status
marital status (including equal/same sex marriage) and civil partnership
caring responsibilities
trade union activity or political beliefs
any other grounds.
we will demonstrate our commitment by:
promoting equality of opportunity and diversity within the communities in which we work and with all our partners and workforce
treating our customers, colleagues and partners fairly and with respect
ensuring our customers have access to reasonable adjustments or additional support to enable them to access benefits, use our services and meet their individual responsibilities
aiming to build a workforce which reflects our customer base, within the diverse communities in which we work, with the aim of having equal representation across the workforce
embedding equality analysis into all our service delivery and decision making processes
promoting an environment free from discrimination, bullying and harassment, and taking action where such unacceptable behaviour exists
utilising equality data to monitor the impact of our policies and procedures and inform future changes
building in legislative requirements and best practice to all our service delivery and employee policies and procedures, and supporting these with appropriate training and guidance
setting departmental equality objectives to increase the diversity of our workforce and foster an inclusive environment where different perspectives and colleague experiences are valued
every person working for the department has a personal responsibility for implementing and promoting these commitments in their day-to-day dealings with everyone – including members of the public, other colleagues and employers and partners. inappropriate behaviour is not acceptable.
we will measure and report on the effectiveness of our service delivery and employee policies and processes, in relation to these commitments through performance and management information monitoring. this information will be used to inform future policy and to enhance business processes.
learning and development for colleagues
we think it is important that all our colleagues understand the importance of diversity, equality and inclusion and can contribute to the achievement of the department’s objectives. all colleagues have access to a range of learning and development products to help build their knowledge and understanding.
there are a number of employee led diversity and inclusion staff networks that include a focus on age, carers, disability, faith and belief, gender, gender identity, race, transgender, sexual orientation and social mobility. these networks contribute directly to departmental diversity and inclusion priorities by acting as a consultation forum, and by providing safe spaces for colleagues to share their experiences and promotion of best practice.
disability and carer confident
dwp is recognised as being both a disability confident leader and also carer confident (ambassador). both of these assessments demonstrate the departmental commitment to attracting, recruiting and retaining disabled people and those with caring responsibilities, and supporting them in the workplace to achieve their full potential.
thriving at work
the framework outlined in the thriving at work review supports employers to voluntarily report on disability, mental health and wellbeing in the workplace. dwp publishes a voluntary report on disability, mental health and wellbeing, updated annually, and has also signed the mental health at work commitment.
business in the community
dwp is committed to taking practical steps to tackle recruitment and progression barriers and increasing the diversity of our workforce. dwp was an early signatory of the business in the community’s race at work charter.
age friendly employer
dwp is the first government department to sign the centre for ageing better age-friendly employer pledge. dwp is committed to exemplary practice in the recruitment, retention and support of workers to ensure all age groups have equitable access to opportunities within our organisation.
social mobility
we externally measure our progress on improving our socio-economic diversity through participation in the social mobility employer index to ensure all colleagues irrespective of their background have the support needed to progress their careers.
public sector equality duty
the equality act 2010 applied a public sector equality duty (psed) to public bodies. the equality duty requires public authorities to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations. in addition, many public bodies, including the dwp, have specific duties under the act.
the specific duties require us to publish:
equality information
equality objectives
equality information
as a public authority, we must publish, at least annually, relevant, proportionate information demonstrating our compliance with the equality duty. this replaces the previous requirement to publish equality schemes.
we’ve published separate reports about employee and customer data since 2014.

equality objectives 2023 to 2025
as part of our commitment to embedding and meeting our public sector equalities duties, we have set the following objectives:
tackling employment gap inequalities for ethnic minority jobseekers in areas where there is a high ethnic minority population and a high employment gap. we will do this through outreach activity with the voluntary sector and other organisations supporting ethnic minority young people to create job and skills opportunities, mentoring circles and collaborating with employers to increase the diversity of their workforces.
improving employment outcomes for underrepresented groups such as women and those from ethnic minority backgrounds, and supporting those on low incomes back into, and to progress in work.
work through jcp alongside local areas, and wider government to minimise additional barriers disabled people may face when in and out of work, with a focus on better aligning the work and health systems.
work to ensure that employers have the support, guidance and confidence in order that they can promote healthy and inclusive workplaces and to continually reduce the disability employment gap.
assist those aged fifty and over through early and targeted employment, skills and employer-led support, to stay in, progress or return to work and build their future financial resilience.
maximising jobcentre support and opportunities for people with caring responsibilities and those with disabilities and health conditions to actively prepare for, start and succeed in work, ensuring as best as possible that claimant commitments and support are tailored to peoples’ individual circumstances.
strengthening implementation of the family test assessment in all our domestic policy areas. inclusion of family test outcomes in all relevant policy advice submitted to our ministers and promoting cross-government implementation.
for public appointments to dwp’s arm’s-length bodies, we continue to encourage applications from talented individuals from all backgrounds and across the whole of the united kingdom, with the aim of increasing the number of appointments to those based outside london and the south east.

what we do
hmrc is the uk’s tax, payments and customs authority, and we have a vital purpose: we collect the money that pays for the uk’s public services, and help families and individuals with targeted financial support.
we do this by being impartial and increasingly effective and efficient in our administration. we help the honest majority to get their tax right and make it hard for the dishonest minority to cheat the system.
hmrc is a non-ministerial department, supported by 2 agencies and public bodies.

our corporate documents
corporate information
we are the regulator of medicines, medical devices and blood components for transfusion in the uk.
we put patients first in everything we do, right across the lifecycle of the products we regulate. we rigorously use science and data to inform our decisions, enable medical innovation and to make sure that medicines and healthcare products available in the uk are safe and effective.
our responsibilities are to:
ensure medicines, medical devices and blood components for transfusion meet applicable standards of safety, quality and efficacy (effectiveness)
secure safe supply chain for medicines, medical devices and blood components
promote international standardisation and harmonisation to assure the effectiveness and safety of biological medicines
educate the public and healthcare professionals about the risks and benefits of medicines, medical devices and blood components, leading to safer and more effective use
enable innovation and research and development that is beneficial to public health
collaborate with partners in the uk and internationally to support our mission to enable the earliest access to safe medicines and medical devices and to protect public health
what and how we regulate
we operate in a statutory framework set by hm government, working within government and the wider health system to direct overall policy in our regulatory field.
these policies establish our role in securing public health improvements and gives us the powers to deliver against our corporate responsibilities.
medicines and vaccines
medical devices
blood components
e-cigarettes
traditional herbal and homeopathic remedies
we constantly strive for improvement in our field, and when we identify changes that will improve people’s access to safe, quality healthcare products, our recommendations are agreed by the secretary of state.
our corporate governance
we are governed by a unitary board of directors with an equal number of executive and non-executive directors, and a non-executive chairperson, supported by three board assurance committees.
the board is responsible for advising on the strategic direction of the agency, ensuring that targets set out in the business plan and agreed with ministers, are met.
the board is not involved in any regulatory decisions affecting medicines or medical devices. these are the responsibility of the chief executive and executive committee (senior leadership team). however, the board members must make declarations of interests to ensure their independence.
our independent advisory bodies
advisory board on the registration of homeopathic products: the advisory board advises on the safety and quality of homeopathic medicines when there’s an application for registration, marketing authorisation or licence of right.
blood consultative committee: the blood consultative committee works with the national executive blood bodies and other stakeholders to develop advice and recommendations on regulatory aspects of blood banks, blood establishments and blood processes.
british pharmacopoeia: the bp makes an important contribution to the role of the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (mhra) in protecting public health by providing quality standards for uk pharmaceutical substances and medicinal products.
clinical practice research datalink (cprd) research data governance (rdg) process: independent scientific and patient advice on research-related requests to access cprd data via the non-statutory independent scientific advisory committee was established in 2006, and superseded in june 2021 by the rdg process comprising expert review committees (ercs) and the central advisory committee (cac).
commission on human medicines: the commission on human medicines (chm) advises ministers on the safety, efficacy and quality of medicinal products.
interim devices working group: the interim devices working group is responsible for providing independent, external expert input and advice on a wide range of aspects relating to medical devices to help mhra ensure the safe introduction and management of medical devices.
herbal medicines advisory committee: the herbal medicines advisory committee advises on the safety and quality of herbal medicines when there’s an application for registration, marketing authorisation or product licence.
the review panel: the review panel (mhra) carries out statutory and non-statutory reviews of proposals, decisions and provisional decisions taken by medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency.

complaints procedure
how to make a complaint, raise a concern (whistleblow) or report malpractice about an exam board, awarding organisation or qualification regulated by ofqual.
contents

before you start
complaints we cannot deal with

reporting maladministration, malpractice, qualification fraud or whistleblowing concerns
submit a complaint or concern

if you are concerned about possible criminal activity related to qualification fraud
if you are concerned someone may be at risk of harm
further information
checkpoint: do you want to complain, appeal against your grade, or ask a question?
if you are concerned about 2025 summer exams results, please first contact our enquiries service.
you cannot appeal against your grades using this complaints procedure. for information about the appeals process, see appeal against a gcse, as or a level grade or the result of a qualification.
if you wish to complain about the service you have received from an awarding organisation, or from ofqual, please first read all of the information on this page to ensure that your concerns are routed correctly.
we want all users of organisations and qualifications we regulate to receive a good service and to have things put right when they go wrong. in order for us to investigate your complaint or concern we may require some specific information to help us investigate your complaint and we will help you through this process.
before you start
it will be useful to have documents or emails, awarding organisation, qualification and subject information to support your complaint or concern.
we can only investigate complaints about awarding organisations and qualifications that we regulate. an awarding organisation (also known as an exam board or awarding body) develops qualifications, issues certificates, diplomas or titles and learning outcomes of an individual following assessments.
details of regulated awarding organisations can be found on ofqual’s find a regulated awarding organisation service. regulated qualifications can be found on the find a regulated qualification service.
complaints we cannot deal with
if we can’t deal with your complaint, we will tell you and, where possible, suggest an alternative agency or organisation. some examples where we may not be able to assist include:
where there is an appeals process to challenge an assessment decision or a candidate’s results for a qualification regulated by ofqual – see instead ‘appeal against a gcse, as or a level grade or the result of a qualification’
matters which have already been fully investigated through this complaints policy
issues which do not fall under ofqual’s remit, for example, if your complaint is about the quality of teaching or training by a school or college - you should complain to the school or college involved
matters which are, or have been, the subject of legal or on-going regulatory action, or potential action
where you disagree with our policies
please note, if you are seeking financial compensation, you may wish to seek independent legal advice. ofqual is unable to award compensation and cannot provide this outcome.
complaints we can investigate
you can make a complaint to ofqual about how an awarding organisation:
handled a complaint made to them
carried out their responsibilities around registrations, certifications or assessments for candidates
managed arrangements with schools, colleges or training providers
you can also make a complaint about ofqual regarding how we have carried out, or failed to carry out our work.
reporting maladministration, malpractice, qualification fraud or whistleblowing concerns
you can report a concern about:
qualifications awarding organisations offer
exams and assessments in schools, colleges and training providers
your employer’s role in delivering a qualification (whistleblowing)
there are different reporting methods depending on whether you are reporting a concern of qualification fraud, maladministration, malpractice, or reporting a whistleblowing concern.
maladministration
maladministration generally covers mistakes or poor process where there has been no intention on the part of the person responsible to do any harm. it may involve some degree of incompetence or ineptitude, or may result from carelessness or inexperience.
malpractice
malpractice will generally involve some form of intent. it may also include circumstances where an individual has been negligent or reckless as to the consequences of their actions.
qualification fraud
there are several ways qualification fraud may be committed. these include:
creating, buying or using fake certificates for regulated qualifications
delivering ‘fast track’ training which leaves out important and necessary content
helping learners cheat in tests by giving answers or taking a test on their behalf
whistleblowing
you’re a whistleblower if you’re a worker and you report certain types of wrongdoing. this will usually be something you’ve seen at work though not always.
the wrongdoing you disclose must be in the public interest. this means it must affect others, for example the general public.
summer exam results
if you are concerned about 2025 summer exam results, please first contact our enquiries service.
submit a complaint or concern
submit a concern about 2025 summer exam results.
submit a complaint.
report a maladministration, malpractice, qualification fraud or whistleblowing concern.
we will process and handle your personal data in line with our personal information charter.
to ensure ofqual deals with all complaints equally and fairly, all complaints sent to other parts of ofqual, including the chief regulator or board members, will be forwarded to the complaints investigation team for action.
advice and support in making your complaint
you may find it helpful to have support to make your complaint. your local citizens advice may be able to give you information and advice. there are other organisations that may be able to support people in specific situations, such as:
age uk
independent age
mencap
mind
rethink
someone who represents you and makes a complaint for you is called an advocate. if you decide that you want an advocate to make a complaint to us on your behalf, when they contact us about your complaint, we will check with you that you’re happy for them to do this.
if you are concerned about possible criminal activity related to qualification fraud
you should make a non-emergency report to the police or make a report on the action fraud site.
for some qualifications you can also report directly to the appropriate industry body, contact:
security industry authority about door supervisor licenses (commonly called ‘bouncers’)
construction skills certification scheme or construction industry training board about construction skills certification scheme (cscs) cards
uk visas and immigration about english for speakers of other languages (esol) international qualifications
if you are concerned someone may be at risk of harm
ofqual is not a referral body for safeguarding, but we do signpost people at risk of harm to relevant advice and support.
if you are worried about immediate risk of harm to yourself or another person, please contact the police.
if you want to report concerns to a relevant organisation who can check out your concerns, please contact your local council.
if you are looking for someone to talk to about your concerns you might find it helpful to talk to one of these organisations, some of which you can contact at any time of the day or night:
the samaritans
nspcc (for younger people)
hourglass (for older people)
