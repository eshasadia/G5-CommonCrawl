information for landlords
all landlords with rental properties in wales must be registered, and agents and self-managing landlords must have a licence to let and manage work at rental properties in wales.
since november 23, 2016, enforcement powers have been active and landlords and agents who are not complying with the law could face a variety of sanctions including prosecution, fixed penalty notices, rent stopping and rent repayment orders. local authorities across wales, including denbighshire council are working with rent smart wales to identify those still not complying with the law. councils are now prosecuting those who have failed to comply.
if you are a landlord or agent yet to comply, don’t delay. it’s important that you take the necessary steps now to comply and avoid action. you can register, apply online and find out more on the rent smart wales website (external website).
letting out all or part of your property could give you a regular income, whilst providing a home for someone.
damp and mould
damp and mould growth are caused by excess moisture, which can be worse in cold weather due to a lack of heating and ventilation. to reduce damp and mould growth in your home, you can:
maintain low level background heating and avoid heating just one room
always ensure that fitted extractor fans are in use and windows are open when bathing/showering and cooking.
improve ventilation by opening windows for a short period every morning to let out the moisture which has built up overnight
remove condensation and moisture from windows and surfaces as soon as it appears
try to avoid drying clothes on radiators or heaters
keep a small gap between large pieces of furniture and the walls to allow air to circulate
get more information about damp and mould from the rent smart wales resource library (external website)
deposits and bonds
there are strict rules about how you should handle the deposit you receive from your tenants. there are three deposit protection schemes available: two insurance-based schemes where you, the landlord, pay a premium so that you can keep the deposit; and one custodial scheme, where the deposit is held on your behalf, free of charge, until the end of the tenancy.

news story
nato claims 'successful year' in afghanistan
a spokesman for nato-led forces said that 2011 had been a 'remarkably successful year' in the fight against insurgents in afghanistan and in the development of the afghan security forces.
from:
ministry of defence
published
26 january 2012
this was published under the 2010 to 2015 conservative and liberal democrat coalition government

in the southern taliban stronghold, ‘considerable advances’ had been made in securing kandahar city and its environs, said international security assistance force spokesman brigadier general carsten jacobson:
the success has been so great that insurgents have largely lost control of the area and now rely on ieds [improvised explosive devices] as their primary method of attack,” he said.
and in the east, forces had he said:
…significantly disrupted the haqqani network through operations shamshir and knife edge, where coalition forces captured or eliminated over 500 insurgent leaders and fighters last fall.
the haqqani network has been blamed for a series of high-profile attacks in kabul, including one on the us embassy in september last year.
the network is based in the afghan-pakistan border region, which brigadier general jacobson said would remain a key focus for operations.
kabul itself had, he said:
…become a thriving commercial capital, able to absorb and respond to spectacular attempts to disrupt security with resolute response to insurgent attacks, leaving the insurgents largely in a state of failure.
brigadier general jacobson said afghan forces were clearly in control of the city, as part of a phased transition ahead of a pull-out of nato combat troops in 2014.
his remarks came in stark contrast to perceptions that security has worsened in the afghan capital over the last 12 months, with a series of spectacular attacks on western targets, such as the us embassy siege.
the afghan army was now almost 180,000-strong, the afghan police has nearly 144,000 men and women in uniform, and by spring of this year security responsibility for more than 50 per cent of afghanistan will be under afghan control, he said.
