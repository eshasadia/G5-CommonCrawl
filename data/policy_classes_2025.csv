This wave, co-ordinated with international partners, marks International Anti-Corruption Day and Human Rights Day.

The package includes individuals and entities involved in a wide range of grievous activities – including the torture of prisoners, the mobilisation of troops to rape civilians, and systematic atrocities.

These sanctions demonstrate the UK’s commitment to defend free societies and the human rights of everyone, everywhere.

Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said:

It is our duty to promote free and open societies around the world.

Today our sanctions go further to expose those behind the heinous violations of our most fundamental rights to account.

We are committed to using every lever at our disposal to secure a future of freedom over fear.

Since gaining new powers following our exit from the EU, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has used targeted sanctions across multiple regimes to hold those committing these egregious acts, whether in Russia, Iran, Myanmar, or elsewhere, to account.

Today’s sanctions include targets from 11 countries across 7 sanctions regimes – the most that the UK has ever brought together in 1 package.

As part of today’s package, the UK has designated 8 individuals under ourGlobal Human Rights regime, which allows the UK to stop those involved in serious human rights abuses and violations from entering the country, channelling money through UK banks, or profiting from our economy. These sanctions include:

The UK is also using geographical sanctions regimes to ensure that violators of human rights are held to account.

10 Iranian officials connected to Iran’s judicial and prison systems, have been sanctioned.

This includes 6 individuals linked to the Revolutionary Courts that have been responsible for prosecuting protestors with egregious sentences including the death penalty.

In addition, Ali Cheharmahali, and Ghloamreza Ziyayi, former directors of the Evin Prison, in Tehran, a facility notorious for the mistreatment of both Iranian and foreign detainees, have been sanctioned. Allah Karam Azizi, warden of Razee Shahr Prison, has also been sanctioned.

The UK has also sanctioned the Russian Colonel Ibatullin for his role as the commander of the 90th Tank Division, which has been on the front line since Russia began its illegal full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Sexual violence in conflict, which is currently happening in at least 18 active conflicts around the world, is an abhorrent act and and prohibited by international law.

In many cases it is used as a deliberate method of warfare. Six individuals and entities are being sanctioned today – utilising one of the tools at the UK’s disposal to hold perpetrators of conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) to account.

Amongst those sanctioned today are Gordon Koang Biel and Gatluak Nyang Hoth, the County Commissioners for Koch and Mayendit in South Sudan. Both individuals were involved in the conflicts in the Unity State between February and May 2022, and mobilised troops to rape civilians.

The Katiba Macina group, also known as the Macina Liberation Front, in Mali, has been sanctioned. The group is known for perpetrating sexual violence, including the organisation of forced marriages

Today’s sanctions also target those involved in the Myanmar military junta. The security forces are known for committing systematic atrocities against the people of Myanmar, including massacre, torture, and rape. Designations include:

The UK is also today using itsGlobal Anti-Corruption regimeto sanction an additional 5 individuals.

Lining their pockets through corruption and theft, corrupt actors have a corrosive effect on the communities around them – undermining democracy and depriving countries of vital resources for their own gain.

As a result, over 2% of global GDP is lost to corruption every single year.

The UK is using sanctions to tackle serious corruption. Today’s designations include:

The UK will continue to use all levers at our disposal to tackle corrupt actors and morally reprehensible violations and abuses, including sexual violence, of human rights around the world.

Today’s designations further develops the UK’s use of sanctions this year to tackle serious human rights violations and abuses and corrupt actors.

In Russia the UK has sanctioned over 1,200 individuals, including members of the Russian military responsible for atrocities. In Iran our sanctions have targeted the officials responsible for heinous human rights violations.

The UK supports those seeking to uphold these values of freedom and democracy, including through:

All individuals are subject to an asset freeze and travel ban. All entities are subject to an asset freeze.

450 student leaders, journalists and academics to be taken to Auschwitz over the next 3 years and expected to educate tens of thousands of students on their return

Communities Secretary also demands all universities and Local Authorities adopt theIHRAdefinition of antisemitism

Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has announced £500,000 of new funding for a programme supporting universities in tackling antisemitism on campus over 3 years.

Announced on the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, the money will support the Holocaust Education Trust (HET) to help educate the next generation about the horrors of the holocaust and the importance of stamping out antisemitism and intolerance.

Each year, 150 university student leaders, student journalists and academics from around the country will hear from Holocaust survivors and visit the former Nazi concentration camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where they will learn about the importance of stamping out antisemitism.

Upon their return, students will participate in a seminar which will deal explicitly with campus-specific issues and how to identify and tackle antisemitism.

To drive engagement amongst the student population, the programme will work with influential student publications and media, as well as student leaders and networks to disseminate the messages they have heard first hand to tens of thousands of students across the country.

The Communities Secretary has also insisted that all universities and Local Authorities must adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism.

He has written to all local authorities asking them to adopt the internationally-recognised definition and will shortly publish a list of those who have taken this forward and urged others to follow.

Communities Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:

As we mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, it is our duty to ensure that as the last survivors remain with us, their stories are shared with future generations.

Education is one of the most powerful tools we can use to combat antisemitism. I am proud this government will fund the Holocaust Educational Trust to educate thousands of students and academics in the horrors of the Holocaust.

This additional £500,000 of funding will allow hundreds of university students and academics each year to visit Auschwitz-Birkenau, hear from the last Holocaust survivors and, on return to their campuses, help educate students on the importance of tackling antisemitism.

I have also been clear that all universities and local councils that have not already done so, must adopt theIHRAdefinition of antisemitism. I will shortly publish a list of councils who have adopted the definition and will urge others to follow.

The student programme will be delivered by the Holocaust Educational Trust in partnership with the Union of Jewish Students. It follows the highly successful 2018-19 scheme which identified 30 universities in England where there had been reports of high levels of antisemitism or racism.

Funded by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG), the next phase will be a chance for a greater number of universities to get involved and builds on fromHET’s highly successful ‘Lessons from Auschwitz’ programme for school students.

Chief Executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust Karen Pollock MBE said:

As we mark 75 years since the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, we are reminded today of the importance of speaking out against antisemitism, wherever it is found.

Student leaders themselves are at the coalface on campus combatting the antisemitism that blights many students’ university experience. We are proud therefore that thanks to new government funding we will be able to offer a unique opportunity for student leaders and Vice-Chancellors for the next three years to visit Auschwitz.

They will see for themselves the site where 1.1 million people were murdered, to understand where hate can ultimately lead and I hope this experience will empower them to stand up to prejudice, hatred and division on campus and in broader society.

We are proud to partner with the Union of Jewish Students to deliver this important project.

Daniel Kosky, Union of Jewish Students Campaigns Organiser:

We are immensely grateful that our vitally important partnership withHETcan continue into the future with the support of the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. The 3-year commitment to taking student and university leaders to Auschwitz-Birkenau will be a vital tool in tackling antisemitism and hatred on campus.

We have sadly seen an increase of antisemitic incidents on campus, with distressing incidents of Holocaust trivialisation at student parties, the use of antisemitic stereotypes on student social media groups, and an increase in antisemitism in campus discussion around Israel.

We are determined to combat this and welcome this significant contribution to our longstanding work bringing students of all faiths and backgrounds together to create cohesive campus communities.

On Thursday 23 January the Communities Secretary attended the Fifth World Holocaust Forum at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem. He attended the event entitled, “Remembering the Holocaust: Fighting Antisemitism,” to mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz and International Holocaust Remembrance Day.

HET’s new programme will bring together 150 university staff and student leaders from across the country each year through education on the Holocaust, anti-racism work, British values and understanding of faith.

The scheme will underpin joint activity with the Union of Jewish Students to combat prejudice on campus and promote community cohesion.

The new programme will encompass all universities, targeting 450 university student leaders directly who will in turn reach a further 24,000 university students.

HET’s Lessons from Auschwitz Project for sixth form students and teachers is now in its nineteenth year.

It has taken over 41,000 students and teachers from across the UK to the Nazi concentration and death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau, as well as many MPs and other guests.

For more information see:Lessons From Auschwitz

In 2018 to 2019HETreached 125 senior leaders and student leaders.

The project identified 30 universities in England where there had been reports of high levels of antisemitism and/or racism and of these 22 institutions 73% participated.

Four delegations of National Union of Students (NUS), Student Union and student faith leaders went alongside existing LFA trips to Auschwitz, combined with orientation seminars and follow up workshops.

Participants have included two formerNUSPresidents,NUSVice Presidents for Society and Citizenship, Further Education, Welfare and Union Development; aNUSLGBT Officer; Presidents of the Students Unions at the universities of Abertay, Brunel, City (London), Coventry, Kent, Leeds Trinity, Lincoln, Nottingham, South Wales, St. Andrews, Sussex and Swansea; Education, Campaigns, and Welfare Officers from University College London, Warwick, and Trinity College Dublin.

Participants in these programmes have facilitated dozens of campus events to combat hatred and prejudice and to mark Holocaust Memorial Day. This activity has reached a further 4000 students on campuses from Exeter to Edinburgh.

The Jewish Leadership Council are working alongsideMHCLGto encourage local authorities to adopt theIHRA.

2,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nhs-staff-receive-pay-rise,Press release,NHS staff receive pay rise,Most eligible dentists and doctors will receive at least a 6% pay rise. Pay for junior doctors will be increased by an average of around 8.8%.,Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Steve Barclay MP,13 July 2023,"Pay scales for most doctors and dentists to increase by at least a 6% this year after the government accepted the recommendations from the independent pay review bodies in full.

Around 130,000 full-time equivalent doctors and dentists, including junior doctors and consultants, will see their pay rise in line with the Review Body on Doctors’ and Dentists’ Remuneration’s (DDRB) recommendations. Pay for junior doctors will be increased by 8.8% on average. The agreement means pay for a first year junior doctor will increase by 10.3%. Pay for the most experienced junior doctors will increase by 8.1%. For consultants, this means a rise of 6%.

Health and Social Care Secretary Steve Barclay said:

We hugely value the work of all NHS staff.

That’s why we’re giving junior doctors, consultants and senior NHS staff a fair and reasonable pay rise as recommended by the independent pay review bodies.

But it also balances the need to keep inflation in check while giving some staff significant pay increases.

We’ve made it clear this pay award is not up for negotiation and urge those unions still in dispute with the government to end their strikes immediately.

As recommended by theDDRB, most dentists and doctors will receive at least a 6% pay rise. Junior doctor pay will be increased by 6% plus £1,250.

Average basic pay for a first year junior doctor will increase from £29,300 to £32,300 and for a junior doctor in core training with 3 years’ experience it will increase from £40,200 to £43,900. For consultants andSASdoctors on pre-2021 contracts, this is on top of the 4.5% pay rise they received last year. Some staff will also benefit from performance pay, overtime, pay progression and pay rises from promotion, alongside the pay uplift.

The government has been clear about the need for pay awards to recognise the hard work of the public sector while meeting the Prime Minister’s priority to halve inflation and managing public spending effectively.

More borrowing would add pressures on inflation at exactly the wrong time, risking higher interest rates and higher mortgage rates. The government plans to increase the main rate of the immigration health surcharge - to ensure it covers the full healthcare costs of those who pay it, having been frozen for the last 3 years despite high inflation and wider pressures - to at least £1,035, and the discounted rate for students, their dependents, those on Youth Mobility Schemes and under-18s to £776. The government will fund this pay award through prioritisation within existing departmental budgets, with front line services being protected.

Last month one million NHS staff, including nurses and paramedics, received a 5% pay rise worth at least £1,065 to full-time staff as well as 2 one-off payments worth at least £1,655.

Today’s announcement comes weeks after the NHS published its first everNHS Long Term Workforce Plan, backed by over £2.4 billion government funding, which will deliver the biggest training expansion in NHS history and recruit and retain hundreds of thousands more staff over the next 15 years.

The pay review bodies considered a range of evidence from various organisations.

All pay awards will be backdated to 1 April 2023. This pay award is only applicable to NHS staff in England. The 2023 to 2024 pay uplift for NHS staff directly employed by NHS providers will be funded by NHS England through system allocations.

The government asked theDDRBandSSRBfor recommendations for NHS staff not already in multi-year deals - this includes junior doctors, dentists in training, consultants,SASdoctors on old contracts, dentists and salariedGPs.

The full Pay Review Body reports can be found on GOV.UK. TheReview Body for Doctors’ and Dentists’ Remuneration(covering doctors and dentists not in multi-year deals) recommended a 6% increase for the majority of its remit group. Pay for junior doctors will increase by around 8.8% on average. This is because theDDRBrecommended 6% plus £1,250 on a consolidated basis.

TheSenior Salaries Review Body(covering very senior managers in the NHS and executive senior managers inDHSC’s arm’s length bodies) recommended a 5% increase, with a further 0.5% in each employing organisation used to address specific pay anomalies.

Following acceptance of the Agenda for Change (AfC)  offer by the NHS Staff Council, the government confirmed it would no longer be seeking recommendations on the 2023 to 2024 pay award from the NHS Pay Review Body (NHSPRB) for non-medical staff on theAfCcontract.

The government has since received thereport from theNHSPRBwith their observations on the pay deal in England which we welcome and we have published at the same time as theDDRBandSSRBreports.

Those already in multi-year deals were not in scope of the pay review body’s recommendations this year. TheDDRBwere not asked to make a pay recommendation forGPpartners as they are subject to a 5-year investment agreement to 2023 to 2024, which was agreed with NHS England and theBMAin 2019. For salariedGPs, the 6% award will raise the minimum salary by around £3,900 and the maximum by around £5,900.

TheGPcontract will be uplifted to provide funding for salaried general practice staff. This funding will be backdated to April 2023 and it is our expectation this funding is passed on promptly to all salaried general practice staff. As self-employed contractors to the NHS, it is forGPpractices to determine uplifts in pay for their employees.

The government is absolutely committed to ensuring the NHS has the funding it needs to deliver for patients.

The government is committed to living within its means and delivering value for the taxpayer, and therefore it’s prioritising within existing departmental funding to fund these uplifts.

The government is working in collaboration with the NHS Staff Council toimplement the NHS pay deal.",Pay awards for NHS staff,Welfare,,id25_2

The decision by the Israeli Higher Planning Committee to approve plans for settlement construction in the E1 area, East of Jerusalem, is unacceptable and a violation of international law.

We condemn this decision and call for its immediate reversal in the strongest terms.

Minister Smotrich says this plan will make a two-state solution impossible by dividing any Palestinian state and restricting Palestinian access to Jerusalem. This brings no benefits to the Israeli people. Instead, it risks undermining security and fuels further violence and instability, taking us further away from peace.

The Government of Israel still has an opportunity to stop the E1 plan going any further. We encourage them to urgently retract this plan.

Unilateral action by the Israeli government undermines our collective desire for security and prosperity in the Middle East. The Israeli government must stop settlement construction in line with UNSC Resolution 2334 and remove their restrictions on the finances of the Palestinian Authority.

Only a few short weeks ago in May, the crew had undertaken a 12 day mission to the International Space Station to deliver an integrated cargo carrier and a Russian built mini research module and to carry out maintenance work during three space walks.

While out in space, the astronauts shot a 20-minute film which premiered at a public lecture they presented at Action Stations in Portsmouth Historic Dockyard on Sunday night.

Minister for Universities and Science David Willetts, who attended the crew’s lecture, said:

“Space may be the final frontier but it is often the starting point for inspiring young people to study science, engineering and maths at school. They are our next generation of scientists who are vital to the UK’s future. That’s why I’m delighted to welcome personally the Atlantis crew to our shores on their mission to engage UK children in STEM subjects and encourage them all to reach for the stars.”

It comes as Pinewood Studios announced a new hub at its Buckinghamshire site to support Britain’s indie filmmakers.

In a statement in the House of Commons, she said:

Our independent film sector has produced films like Pride, The King’s Speech and Bend it Like Beckham that shows our heritage, our communities, and our culture to the world. It acts as a springboard from the grassroots for world class UK talent both on screen and behind the scenes.

But while major film production has flourished, smaller budget independent films have not received sufficient support over the last decade. They face multiple challenges - rising production costs, crew shortages, and declining revenues which have hampered the growth of this vital part of the sector.

While too much of our creative industries have traditionally been concentrated in just one part of the country, independent film thrives everywhere given the chance. So this uplift will not only boost creativity but create jobs, growth and investment in every nation and region. Through this we will help the independent film sector to reach its full potential.

In response to the tax relief, Pinewood hastoday announceda new Independent Film Hub at its world-famous studios in Buckinghamshire. It will offer British indie filmmakers taking advantage of the tax relief support services and access to sound stages and workshop space.

As well as confirming the tax relief, Nandy announced that the government will work with Skills England to improve career opportunities for young people in the creative industries. She said:

Too often people do not see themselves and their communities reflected in the story we tell ourselves about ourselves as a nation. And we are determined that this is going to change.

The skills shortage that has been ignored for too long acts as a brake on the ambitions of this incredible sector. That is why this Government has already launched Skills England, to bring the skills we need for a decade of national renewal for our communities, businesses and country.

We will focus apprenticeships once more on young people, to set them up to succeed and help fill the 49,000 vacancies in the creative sector.

The Secretary of State for Education is overhauling the apprenticeship levy in order to provide better career opportunities for young people. Building on the success of existing high quality apprenticeships in the creative industries, we will work closely with Skills England to ensure the new flexibilities announced by the Prime Minister last month offer shorter apprenticeships and improve the offer for a creative skills pathway for young people embarking on careers in the creative sector.

Every child should have the chance to live a richer, larger life and consider a career in the arts.

Nandy also confirmed that yesterday the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government recovered an appeal against the refusal of planning permission for Marlow Film Studios in Buckinghamshire. The planning merits of the proposal will now be reviewed by their Ministers in detail before reaching a decision.

This evening Nandy will go on to attend the opening of the 68th London Film Festival at the BFI Southbank which is opening with the World Premiere of Blitz, the new Second World War film from one of Britain’s most successful directors, Steve McQueen.

“In this regard, we actively and fully support the mediated dialogue under the auspices of Lady Ashton on behalf of the European Union. The dialogue provides a crucial opportunity to find peaceful solutions to outstanding issues between Belgrade and Pristina, and to move both Serbia and Kosovo towards a secure future in the EU.

“We have said in the past and we reiterate now that the way neighbourhood issues are dealt with is a key benchmark for an EU perspective. Therefore, Serbia and Kosovo need to focus, in the dialogue under EU-auspices, on all six issues currently under discussion as well as on progress in northern Kosovo.

“Over the last twelve months, the Iranian regime has stepped up its campaign of intimidation and human rights abuses. The rate of executions is alarming, with many carried out in public and following trials that fall far short of international standards.  Crackdowns on any form of dissent continue, with some reports suggesting Iran has the highest number of journalists in prison of any country in the world.

The Foreign Secretary also encouraged readers to submit questions via hisFacebookandTwitteraccounts which they would like the Conference to address. Some of these questions will be put to delegates in London.

The advent and development of cyberspace is transforming our world and revolutionising our everyday lives. This may become a global challenge and require a global, co-ordinated response. However, until now, the debate around what form this response should take has been fragmented and lacked focus.

The UK believes this must change. More international consensus is urgently needed. And this needs to be a collective endeavour, involving the major actors in cyberspace.

That is why I have invited representatives from not just governments, but also civil society and business to the London Conference on Cyberspace on 1 and 2 November.  No one government, or country, has the answers. Together we must begin to address how we can maintain the economic and social benefits of the Internet and guard against the criminal and security cyber threats without suffocating future innovation.

Access to the Internet has grown at an incredible rate: from 16 million users in 1995 to nearly 2 billion today. This rapid development of the Web, with its connective power, has created enormous economic and social opportunities which we couldn’t have foreseen less than two decades ago.

The expansion of our networked world is in all our interests: for every 10% increase in broadband access, it is estimated that global GDP will rise by an average of 1.3%. As well as encouraging competition and efficiency, it is opening up new markets.

Web-based industry has already become a critical part of our economies. The UK’s industry is already worth £100 billion, accounting for 8% of our total GDP, and is forecast to grow at 10% over the next four years. Globally, e-commerce sees US $8 trillion change hands each year.

In an increasing number of countries, we now rely on the Internet for almost everything we do, from getting our job done and learning new skills to keeping in touch with friends and even paying our taxes.

The web also fosters innovation and creativity, as well as educating whole generations, not least by granting rapid access to information and ideas. On Google alone, over 1 billion searches are made every day.

Our reliance on cyber blurs geographical boundaries, breaks down traditional cultural and religious divides, brings families and friends closer together and enables contact between those who share common interests or concerns. It has changed the way we all communicate.

The internet has fostered transparency and allowed individuals to hold their governments to account.  For some, the opportunities are far more profound. The Arab Spring has shown how the ability to share ideas has brought previous unimagined changes and helped ordinary citizens to stand up against oppressive regimes, highlighting their brutality to the rest of the world.

The provision of public services, the response to emergencies and natural disasters, as well as the ability to solve crimes are being improved immeasurably through the use of cyber.

In developing countries, the Internet is already making a difference and giving many a better future, from educating rural communities to enabling the remote monitoring of HIV patients and predicting outbreaks of disease.

But the rise of the networked world has also produced significant challenges which undermine these benefits and pose a serious threat to reaping the full potential of a cyber world.

Progress has been made in recent years to enhance global connectivity. Yet the digital divide remains substantial: 95% of Icelanders have Internet access, compared to only 0.1% of Liberians. Two thirds of the world’s population is still unable to log on.

Cyber also provides opportunities for criminals, who use it to steal identities and ideas, defraud governments and businesses, as well as exploit the most vulnerable in our societies. The financial cost of cybercrime is substantial, as much as $1trillion per year globally. The human cost is far greater.  Terrorists also use the Internet to plan murderous attacks and flood chat rooms with their poisonous ideology to recruit the next generation.

Repressive governments use advances in technology to violate their citizen’s rights; restricting privacy and freedom of expression and preventing access to information that so many of us take for granted. It has also opened up new channels for States to launch hostile attacks on one another by damaging infrastructure or stealing secrets, this has promoted a fear of ‘cyber war’. The threat is real: there are approximately 20,000 malicious emails sent to British government networks every month; 1,000 of these were deliberately sent to attack these networks.

We do not underestimate the difficulties ahead. Some countries do not share our view of the positive impact of the Internet. Achieving the broad, international consensus we need will not be easy. It will take time.

This is one of the great challenges of our time. Nobody controls the Internet; and we can’t leave its future to chance. We have the opportunity to secure a bold and innovative future but we also face the risk that the internet is used as a force for harm. We must start to act now if we are to protect and preserve the tremendous opportunities that the development of cyberspace offers us all.

In London, we hope to set an agenda that will allow the world to enjoy the full benefits of a safe and secure cyberspace for generations to come.",London Conference on Cyberspace,Other,,id25_8

“Since the Advisory Group on human rights was established a year ago, I have seen it develop into a credible forum for constructive engagement with the wider human rights community, on the Government’s international human rights policy. Today’s meeting was a valuable opportunity to focus discussion on specific countries where the human rights record is of particular concern, including a number in the Middle East and North Africa. We also discussed business and human rights - how we can integrate the human rights and prosperity agenda using a more joined up approach; and finally, freedom of religion or belief, exploring what more could be done to prevent the persecution of religious minorities, as well as other important issues.

“I want to take this opportunity to thank the group’s members for their active contribution in helping shape discussions, sharing their perspectives on issues,  which has been insightful  and informative.

She tells of how women went from cooks and cleaners to lawyers and judges.",Foreign & Commonwealth Office,4 May 2012,"“The court did have female prosecutors and judges originally, but their role involved cooking lunch in the hallways of the headquarter buildings.  One of the first things the project did was to set up a canteen so that female members of staff were relieved of cooking duties and able to take up their roles as lawyers and judges. By the time I left the chief judge was a woman.”

Setting up the court, coordinating the efforts of the UK, US and Norwegian mentors, who were police officers, lawyers and judges back home, was just one of the projects that Katie worked on during her year in Afghanistan. Through one of her Afghan contacts, she set up a fund to support a small home school for girls and women who has missed out on education under the Taliban. The school’s 21 pupils can now read and write:

“The home schools were set up by a lady who was illiterate when she married her husband. Once married they wanted to get her some education but then the Taliban took over and it was forbidden for girls to learn. All of the female teachers were sent home too as women were forbidden to work. But this did not faze the couple, who secretly hired some female teachers and set up an underground school for her and other women and girls who lived nearby. There are lots of stories of secret schools under the Taliban - even boys did not receive proper education and were only really taught to memorise large tracts of the Koran.

By the time the Taliban were removed, she had effectively finished secondary school and was able to go on to further education - she is now an optometrist. She has since set up home schools in her home village because, although there are government schools, her village is quite remote, and still controlled by tribal elders who do not necessarily agree with girls being educated.”

Katie says the bravery of the people involved in the home schools has inspired her.

“They still receive threats because there are elements that do not agree with women being educated. But regardless they pick themselves up and carry on.

“We’re now setting up a small library that all the local schools and home schools can access - because they know that what they are doing is so crucial to the future of Afghanistan.”

Katie was one of over 100 civilians who were awarded the Civilian Service Medal for Afghanistan for their work on 3 May.

“I have held meetings today here at the Foreign Office with members of the Syrian opposition, both from the Syrian National Council and from the National Coordination Body.

“We are very concerned in the British Government about the continuing violence, the continued actions of the Syrian regime in killing many of their own people, committing by all accounts terrible torture and abuse and of course we want to continue to step up the international pressure on the Assad regime, a regime that has long since lost its legitimacy in the eyes of the wider world.

“That pressure takes many different forms. In the European Union, we have adopted strong sanctions already including a ban on the import of Syrian crude oil in to the European Union, that’s ninety per cent of Syrian crude oil, as well as many other sanctions, travel bans and asset freezes on particular individuals and entities.  We’re working with our European partners to add further to those sanctions in the coming days and weeks.

“It also includes debating the matter in the United Nations General Assembly, specifically in the third committee of the General Assembly, the Human Rights Committee, which we will be doing this week and sponsoring a resolution on Syria. We remain disappointed of course that at the United Nations Security Council in early October the resolution which we sponsored was vetoed by Russia and China which I continue to believe was a great mistake on their part, particularly in the light of recent events and I hope that we can return to the matter in the future at the United Nations Security Council.

“We’re working closely with the Arab League. I spoke to the Secretary General of the Arab League, Mr El Araby, yesterday and we commend the efforts that they have made to bring together Arab opinion, to put well worked out proposals to the Syrian regime; but these are proposals that have not been accepted, a great mistake on the part of the Assad regime.

“And so today we have met with members of the opposition. They have described to me some of the grave abuses and loss of life taking place in Syria. I have of course expressed the view we’ve held since the summer that the Assad regime should go, that is the best thing for the future of Syria.  But I’ve also emphasised the importance to them of achieving a united platform and a unified body among the opposition. At an extreme moment in their nation’s history it is important for opposition groups to be able to put aside their own differences and come to a united view of the way forward.

“I’ve also emphasised to them the importance of non violent protest and the importance of retaining international support in this situation through non violent protest. And finally I’ve emphasised to them the importance of respecting the rights of minorities. Syria is a complex country. I’ve emphasised that democracy means not only holding elections in the future, but entrenching human rights including the rights of minorities in Syria and that will give reassurance both within Syria and to people who wish the Syrian people well all over the world.

“We will continue our contacts with the Syrian opposition. I’ve appointed a senior official to lead our liaison and coordination with them. During the Turkish state visit to London this week we will have further important discussions with Turkey about the situation in Syria and will be in constant touch with the Arab League as they come to their Ministerial meeting on this tomorrow.

“The message for the regime is that the rest of the world is talking to the Syrian opposition, that we are looking to a different future for Syria, for the Syrian people to decide for themselves what, what we want is what so many people in Syria want, a free and democratic future for the people of Syria.  And I think the Assad regime will find that more and more Governments around the world are willing to work with the opposition to step up the level of their contacts as we have done today as part of the increasing pressure on this regime and its completely unacceptable behaviour.”","Sanctions (EU ban on Syrian crude oil, asset freezes, travel bans)",Monetary,Other,id25_12
13,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/written-ministerial-statement-on-marine-conservation-zones,Press release,Written Ministerial Statement on Marine Conservation Zones,Environment Minister Richard Benyon today made the following Written Ministerial Statement:,"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs and The Rt Hon Lord Benyon",15 November 2011,"Environment Minister Richard Benyon today made the following Written Ministerial Statement:

As part of the Government’s commitment to implementing in full the provisions of the Marine and Coastal Access Act, we are creating a network of national protected areas in British seas to ensure our underwater wildlife flourishes in years to come. We are clear that looking after the wildlife and habitat in our seas is just as important as looking after those on land.

The Government’s first step to identifying new Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs) in English waters was taken forward through four regional MCZ projects managed by the Statutory Nature Conservation Bodies, who are Natural England and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. The regional projects provided their recommendations for proposed sites for MCZs on 8 September. These have been reviewed by the independent Science Advisory Panel (SAP) and their advice to the SNCBs and Defra is beingpublished today on Defra’s website.

The Marine and Coastal Access Act requires the establishment of a network of conservation sites in the UK marine area.  In English waters the network will comprise European Marine Sites, Sites of Special Scientific Interest, sites designated under the Ramsar Convention and Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs).  The Act requires that the network must conserve or improve the UK marine environment and protect a range of representative features.

The regional MCZ projects have done excellent work in bringing stakeholders together and making site recommendations, but it is clear from the SAP’s advice that there are a number of gaps and limitations in the scientific evidence base supporting the MCZ recommendations.

It is important that we get this right.   It is vital that we have an adequate evidence base for every site if we are to create successful well-managed MCZs.  An adequately robust evidence base will be essential when we come to implement management measures.

Defra will therefore be commissioning significant additional work to support MCZ designation including an in depth review of the evidence base for all the regional projects’ site recommendations and committing additional resources to carrying out seabed and habitat monitoring.

Protecting our marine environment is essential and the Government remains fully committed to establishing MCZs to contribute to an ecologically coherent UK network. However, the need to strengthen the evidence base for the MCZ recommendations means this is going to take longer than the ambitious target first put forward.   We are likely to be able to designate some MCZs fairly quickly where the supporting evidence is adequate.  However, for others we anticipate that more investigation will be needed before they can progress towards designation.

Natural England and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee will provide the MCZ impact assessment and their formal advice in July 2012.  This is six months later than previously planned and this revised timetable will  enable them to address the recommendations from the Independent Review of the Evidence Process for Selecting Marine Special Areas of Conservation (published July 2011) and take account of any further evidence obtained from the work that Defra is now commissioning.   We will give careful consideration to all the advice received before undertaking formal public consultation on MCZs by the end of 2012.   This consultation will include all sites recommended by the Regional Projects with clarity on how and when work on them will be taken forward. It is envisaged that  the first MCZ  designations will take place  in 2013.

Defra and delivery partners will work together ensuring that early management measures are put in place to provide effective  levels of protection for designated sites and continuing to build the evidence base for future designations. Defra will also take the opportunity, working with stakeholders and SNCBs, to look at other marine features which may benefit from spatial protection.

This phased approach to designation will also allow more scope to shape the English network taking account of sites being considered by the  devolved administrations and neighbouring Member States.","Commissioning additional work to support MCZ designation, including an in-depth review of the evidence base and seabed/habitat monitoring.",Administrative,Informational,id25_13

Born in Pakistan, Mona Siddiqui is Professor of Islamic Studies and Public Understanding at the University of Glasgow, and the founder and Director of the Centre of Study for Islam. In her short film, she talks about life in the UK, and the opportunities available to people living in Britain. Watch the film below.



Mona came to the UK from Pakistan when she was five years old, and grew up in Huddersfield. After taking her BA in Arabic and French at the University of Leeds, she went on to do an MA in Middle-Eastern Studies and a PhD in Classical Islamic Law at the University of Manchester. She now lives in Glasgow with her family.

In the film, Mona describes her life in Glasgow, surrounded by hills, and very peaceful. She discusses immigration to Britain in the 1960s and 1970s, and the ‘laissez-faire’ nature of British people, who let everyone live the ‘kind of life they want’.

Mona believes that people who migrate to Britain may fear that they will need to sacrifice their identity, but says, “I don’t think there’s any expectation at all that people give up their faith. We have over two million Muslims living in the UK. I think most of them are very happy to be living here”.Mona values the freedom that she has been granted through the academic environment in Britain, and is positive about the way in which UK society allows people to reach for opportunities, choose their own goals, and achieve them.

In 2007, Mona published ‘How to Read the Qur’an’, and she has also published several articles and chapters on classical Islamic Law and Christian-Muslim issues. She offers advice in legal cases, and also provides consultancy work to educational institutions and local government.

Mona is well-known in the UK for her broadcasting work, with regular appearances on radio and in the press. In addition, she has sat on various Advisory Boards for organisations such as Glasgow’s Gallery for Modern Art, Scottish Asian Arts, the IB Tauris Religious Studies project and the Journal of the American Academy of Religion.

She is currently the chair of the BBC’s Scottish Religious Advisory Committee and a member of the Commission on Scottish Devolution and the World Economic Forum’s Global Agenda Council on the Islam-West Dialogue.

The Bonn Conference on 5 December provides President Karzai with an opportunity to set out his vision for an inclusive settlement. It is also an opportunity for the international community to reiterate its long-term commitment to Afghanistan.

The summer fighting season is ending and it has been a hard year for the insurgency. The numbers of both attempted and executed attacks were lower than during the corresponding period last year, continuing the trend observed over the summer.  Despite considerable efforts, insurgents failed to re-establish themselves in areas in the south from which they had previously been displaced. High profile attacks in Kandahar early in October and in Kabul at the end of the month affected Afghan and international perceptions of security. However, Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) disrupted many attempts and responded effectively and professionally to those that got through. Overall, the performance and operational capability of the ANSF continued to develop: they are on track to achieve their October 2012 growth objective of 352,000 and work continued to ensure that the quality of the forces steadily improves.

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime’s (UNODC) 2011 Afghan Opium Survey reported a year on year increase in cultivation of 7% nationally (from 123,000 hectares to 131,000 hectares). However, the increase should be interpreted in the context of a difficult economic backdrop of opium prices (which have doubled in the last year to the highest level since 2004) and that the figures are 32% lower than in 2007 (which saw 193,000 hectares cultivated).

With UK support, the Government of Afghanistan continued to make important progress on revenue collection and budgeting. The Government confirmed their best ever first quarter performance for revenue collection to date, bringing it in line with neighbouring countries including Bangladesh and Pakistan. Meanwhile, Provincial Governments have been working with the Ministry of Finance to ensure that for the first time, local priorities are reflected in plans for next year’s national and provincial budgets. This will improve the Government’s ability to deliver vital basic services to the Afghan people.

Cumbria is one of five regions to benefit from a Rural Growth Network, set up to help rural areas overcome the barriers to economic growth such as a shortage of business premises and poor broadband access.

Mr Paice announced the Rural Growth Network funding on his Rural Roadshow to Cumbria today. Defra Rural Roadshows allow ministers to hear first-hand about rural issues from communities and businesses, to learn about successes and challenges and discover what help is needed to support rural growth and jobs. The direct access to ministers will help ensure that rural England has a strong voice at the heart of Government.

Mr Paice is visiting the Blencathra Business Centre in Keswick which will be transformed into eight new work premises with business services including one-to-one business advice, online training, networking opportunities and access to superfast broadband.  Entrepreneurs will have new work space to start up their companies and jobs will be created as local businesses get the support they need to grow.

This is just one of the Rural Growth Network’s ‘enterprise hubs’ planned for rural areas across Cumbria, which will deliver business support to a range of sectors, including food and drink, adventure sports and digital and creative enterprises.

To date, a total of 76 new work premises are planned for the county.

Farming Minister, Jim Paice said:

“There are particular challenges to running a business in a remote area.  Too often, business people are held back by not being able to find work premises, having no access to superfast broadband, or being unable to expand their skills without travelling into a city. The Rural Growth Network will take down these barriers to growth and enable local businesses to turn their ambitions into reality.  I look forward to visiting Blencathra Business Park today, where our investment will open new doors for rural entrepreneurs.”

The Rural Growth Network is part of the £165 million programme of measures that the Government is delivering to grow business and create new job prospects in rural areas.

As well as meeting local farmers, councils and local enterprise partnerships, on his Rural Roadshow, Mr Paice will have his first meetings with the region’s two Rural and Farming Networks. Defra has established seventeen Rural and Farming Networks across the country to give community and business leaders the chance to shape rural policy by sharing advice and insights through a hotline to Government.

Farming Minister, Jim Paice continued:

“My Rural Roadshow to Cumbria gives me an opportunity to hear first-hand not only about the challenges rural businesses face, but also of the innovative ideas that have made them a success.  It’s all about listening to what works, and how the Government can do more to enable rural businesses to achieve their economic potential and support thriving rural communities.”

In a further boost for the region’s rural economy, a new £15 million investment is announced today to enable top local employer Lake District Creamery to take up new opportunities in the export market.

Mr Paice will visit the company in Aspatria where he will hear how it has developed its processing facilities and upgraded its boiler house in order to branch out into the energy drinks industry. Lake District Creamery, owned by First Milk, a consortium of 2,000 farmers, will announce that it has secured an export deal to supply cheese sticks to Emirates Airlines, which will see around six million portions being consumed by passengers in the next year.

Mr Paice continued:

“Only a few years after purchasing the site, First Milk has already been successful in putting their Lake District Creamery on the world stage. More importantly, the company has shown how an added-value, export-led business strategy, focussing on the long-term opportunities for dairy can drive returns for Cumbrian farmers that supply milk to the creamery.”

To complete his Rural Roadshow, Mr Paice will deliver the keynote speech at the Dairy Farming in Cumbria conference in Penrith.  The conference is the first of its kind and will focus on the challenges faced by farmers, growth opportunities and sharing best practice on farm management.

“We welcome the fact the minister is here in Cumbria. The current milk issues are clearly of great concern to a county like Cumbria with its hugely important dairy sector. As well as the milk issue, the Cumbria and North Lancashire RFN group are also looking to discuss issues around flooding and river and stream maintenance, drainage and the Farming and Forestry Improvement Scheme.”

Notes

The enterprise hub that Jim Paice is visiting today is just one of the enterprise hubs planned for Cumbria.

Added to the eight work spaces in Keswick this makes a total of 76 work spaces for the North East.

All of these enterprise hubs will be networked with one another, acting as centres to facilitate knowledge transfer, provide mentoring, training and skills development to enable businesses to grow and capitalise on new opportunities.

The five areas have been chosen to deliver Rural Growth Networks: Wiltshire, Cumbria, Somerset and Devon, Durham and Northumberland, and Warwickshire.",Rural Growth Network,Institutional,,id25_21

I welcome the ICC judges’ decision to issue arrest warrants for Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, Saif al Islam al Qadhafi and Abdullah al Senussi. These individuals are accused of crimes against humanity and should be held to account before judges in a criminal court. The UK will continue to strongly support the ICC and calls upon the Libyan government to co-operate fully with the ICC investigation.

The warrants further demonstrate why Qadhafi has lost all legitimacy and why he should go immediately. His forces continue to attack Libyans without mercy and this must stop.

Individuals throughout the regime should abandon Qadhafi. We welcome the courageous actions of those who have taken a stance against the regime and recognise the inspiring stories of those who have refused to act against their own people or commit atrocities.

People at all levels of seniority should think carefully about the consequences of what they do - whether they are ordering attacks on civilians or carrying them out; whether they are firing rockets into residential areas or intimidating ordinary Libyans who want a better future.

Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt responded to questions, and said:

“The timing of this debate is opportune, coming as it does at the mid-point of the highly significant negotiations that began in New York last week. It offers an opportunity to take stock of the negotiations and to set out the Government’s priorities for and commitment to a robust and legally binding treaty. I briefed the all-party parliamentary groups on the United Nations, on landmines and unexploded weapons of conflict, and on weapons and protection of civilians at the end of April. I stressed that securing a positive outcome in July would not be easy, but that we would do everything within our power to secure a good result. Nothing that has happened since I attended the opening day of the conference has led me to change my view. This remains an incredibly complex negotiation, made more difficult by a hard core of countries that would like to derail the negotiations.

“No matter how committed we are to securing an arms trade treaty–I do not think anyone is in any doubt about that commitment–we cannot deliver it on our own. That is why we have put so much emphasis on working with our international partners, NGOs and representatives of the UK defence industry in the run-up to the conference. We have collaborated closely with the treaty’s co-authors, the EU and the P5, and will continue to do so as the negotiations progress, to seek to achieve a successful conclusion.

“I do not want to indicate at this stage what the likely outcome will be, but I am on record as saying at one or two meetings that we will not sign an agreement that makes things weaker. There is no point in that, and there has to be a moment when we walk away, but I will not hide it from colleagues that the choice might end up being very difficult. We want to get enough in to make it worth while and we want enough people to sign to make it effective, but there will be some tough choices to make at the end. All I can say is that we will do our best to be as inclusive as possible when we get there. Then we will see. There will always be a tomorrow. That is important. Whether or not this is as successful as we want–it is highly unlikely to be written as we would want it–there will always be the opportunity of a further process.”

“I look forward to the swift formation of the National Congress, appointment of a new Prime Minister and transition to a new Government.

Those receiving medals have worked towards a range of UK Government priorities in Afghanistan, for example by supervising reconstruction projects, providing  humanitarian and development support, working on counter-terrorism and counter-narcotics and helping set up schools.



Speaking at the medal presentation the Foreign Secretary said:

“What is often forgotten is the dedication and devotion of the many thousands of civilians who have worked, in testing conditions, to build democracy and security and improve the lives of ordinary Afghans.

“Many of you will have had to endure the difficulties of life in a combat zone; coming under fire, sleeping in bunk beds, boiling in summer and freezing in winter, separated from your families and loved ones. Achieving what you have, with the enthusiasm and vigour which you have maintained, demonstrates the very highest standards of professionalism and commitment.

“What you have achieved is impressive and you should feel justifiably proud. Since 2001 there has been a fivefold increase of children in education in Afghanistan; eight times as many people have access to a local healthcare facility; and Lashkar Gar, the capital of Helmand Province, held its first set of municipal elections on 30th April last year. These are just a few of the many achievements that you all have contributed to over the last 10 years.

“Whether through projects to build new schools and medical centres; counter narcotics initiatives; or providing legal training to prosecutors, UK-supported activities are bringing stability and security to Afghanistan and that is something that must continue to transition in 2014 and beyond.”

The medal is awarded to all civilians who have served 30 continuous days, or 45 aggregated in Afghanistan in direct support of the Government’s objectives in Afghanistan.

The purpose of this statement is to inform the House about the Government’s reasons and objectives for doing this.

The Commonwealth today is as important to the United Kingdom as ever. The Coalition Agreement sets out a vision “to strengthen the Commonwealth as a focus for promoting democratic values and development.” The Foreign and Commonwealth Office will lead a co-ordinated cross Whitehall approach to help the Commonwealth achieve its potential and which underlines the United Kingdom’s commitment to this unique global organisation.

Our relationship with the Commonwealth has been primarily based on its history, values and common bonds.  But the modern Commonwealth, including countries that were never British colonies, has been transformed. Today’s Commonwealth bridges all of the continents, embraces almost two billion people, and represents all of the world’s major faiths. Its membership includes many of the fastest growing and increasingly technologically advanced economies in the world. These are the great markets of today and tomorrow. Equally important is the forum it provides for numerous smaller nations which may feel that their voice is lost in the wider United Nations structure and who find the more informal Commonwealth setting an ideal place to be heard.

The Commonwealth of the 21st century should stand for democracy, development, and human rights, and act as a recognised force for good on the issues of our times.  It could also be used much more effectively to further the United Kingdom’s foreign policy priorities and worldwide economic interests. The United Kingdom is already at the heart of this ready made network, which fits perfectly into the new global environment. In the words of the Head of the Commonwealth, Her Majesty the Queen, the Commonwealth is indeed ‘the face of the future’.  It is a future in which the United Kingdom will play a full part.

To achieve this, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office will work closely with Whitehall partners to:

Sami Yusuf



Sami is proud of the fact that London has had a huge part to play in his musical journey, from classical music, to operas, to the West End. He says of London, “This is the hub” - the sounds and experiences of the UK’s capital have influenced his creativity and helped shape his unique approach, aimed at using music to unite the world.

“I am who I am because of my upbringing…because of London” says Sami, “it’s a fantastic place…it makes you cool.” He treasures the UK’s values of tolerance and freedom, where individuality is respected and people are able to express themselves as they wish to, and create their own ideas. This freedom helped Sami to recognise people’s common humanity, and to define his music for himself.

Sami has performed all over the world, and has raised millions for those in need. He performed at the Live8 concert in Wembley Arena, raising millions for the victims of Dafur, and also worked to support victims of the 2010 Pakistan floods by releasing a charity single. His spiritually inspired music has been acclaimed by people across the Middle East, America and Africa.

Sami studied at the Royal Academy of Music, and was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of Roehampton in south-west London in recognition of his extraordinary contribution to music. He has also been recognised by the United Nations, having just been made a UN Peace Ambassador. “If I can help bring people closer together,” he says, “that’s something that will make me happy, make me sleep comfortably at night.”",Recognition of Sami Yusuf's contribution and appointment as UN Peace Ambassador,Institutional,Other,id25_34

The threatened reductions not only put in jeopardy the livelihoods of UK fishermen but would have also led to increased discards.

However, following three weeks of protracted discussions culminating in two days of intense negotiations, the Government successfully convinced the EU Commission that the UK approach to conservation was the right way forward. Fishermen in all countries will still face an expected reduction in the amount of time they are allowed to fish but this concession from the commission will allow the UK to develop more conservation measures and provide incentives for fishermen to take them up.

To ensure the future of cod in our seas, the Government will also build on its work with the fishing industry to adopt further measures to protect cod stocks and reduce discards.

During the talks the EU also agreed to increase the total allowable catch for a number of fish species. This will mean that many fishermen will find that they are allowed to catch more fish next year than they were allowed under current quotas.

Speaking from Brussels, Richard Benyon, Minister for the Natural Environment and Fisheries, said:

“After two days of tense and frustrating negotiations I am delighted to have secured the best deal possible for the UK fishing industry and ensure the future sustainability of our fish stocks.

“By arguing that we should follow scientific advice we have been able to agree quotas that will not only allow local fishermen to make a living but will also ensure that we can protect the environment.

“One of my primary goals was to see off the threat of excessive reductions in days at sea which would have put key UK fisheries at risk.”

“The UN General Assembly has made a valuable contribution to human rights today, by drawing attention to three countries where serious abuses still take place and urging their governments to take action.

“This year we have seen encouraging signs of progress in Burma.  But human rights abuses continue, especially in ethnic areas, and the level of support for this resolution shows once again that the international community has not forgotten the people of Burma.  I am pleased to see a resolution which reflects the positive steps taken by the Burmese government, the commitments made by the President, as well as the serious concerns which remain and the need for accountability for human rights abuses past and present.

“By contrast, the human rights situation in Iran has deteriorated even further this year. The rate of executions remains the highest per capita of any country in the world, and the continuing crackdown on fundamental freedoms has seen opposition leaders detained, over forty bloggers and journalists in prison, and hundreds of peaceful protesters arrested. Meanwhile Iran has shown scant evidence of cooperation with the UN to improve its human rights record. I call on Iran to pay heed to the international community’s concerns and meet its obligations. The fact that this resolution passed by a record majority shows the international community is strongly united in its condemnation of human rights abuses in Iran.

“The human rights situation in the DPRK is also of grave concern. Despite considerable encouragement from the international community, the DPRK has refused to give any clear response to the recommendations of the UN Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review or engage with the UN Special Rapporteurs to allow any independent verification. We support the General Assembly’s resolution and continue to urge the DPRK to engage with the international community on human rights.

“Recent events in the Middle East have shown the important human rights advances that can accompany peaceful change. This is why it is vital that we maintain persistent international pressure wherever human rights abuses occur.

“We welcome President Karzai’s announcement today that the first phase of security transition in Afghanistan has started.  This begins the process of a gradual transition, which will be completed across the country by the end of 2014. This will ensure that UK forces will no longer be in a combat role in Afghanistan by 2015.

The decision to begin the first phase of this transition process was informed by an assessment of the security, governance and development situation on the ground. Transition is a process, which will over time achieve our shared goal of the Afghans leading on security. We will not abandon Afghanistan.

We welcome the assessment that Lashkar Gah district in Helmand is ready to begin this first phase. This is a measure of Afghan military and governance capability in this area.  It demonstrates that efforts to support the Afghan National Security Forces through continued training, partnering and mentoring are working.

We warmly welcome President Karzai’s commitment to peace and reconciliation.  We also support the President’s efforts to reach out to insurgents and echo his call to neighbouring countries, including Pakistan, to support a peace process.

The UK and our ISAF partners remain committed to respecting Afghan sovereignty and working together to ensure Afghanistan never again becomes an operating base for international terrorism.  Our Afghanistan strategy is not just about Afghan security capability - military action must be matched by a viable Afghan state and a political process, backed by development. The UK remains committed to a strong, long term partnership with Afghanistan based on diplomacy, trade and development.”","Commitment to a strong, long term partnership with Afghanistan based on diplomacy, trade and development.",Other,,id25_41

Discussing the withdrawal of British troops, Mr Cameron said:

“What I will commit to is that we will do this in a sensible, ordered, practical way - 9,500 to 9,000 this year. As Afghan troops take a bigger role we will be able to reduce troop numbers further next year.

More than 20,000 people have now died in the conflict in Syria, up to 1.5 million are internally displaced and 230,000 have fled to Lebanon, Iraq, Turkey and Jordan. According to the UN, 2.5 million people in Syria need urgent humanitarian assistance - double the number in March - and fewer than half of Syrian primary health-care facilities and hospitals are now fully functional.

The regime is using indiscriminate shelling, aircraft, helicopter gunships and militias to terrorise civilians. There are reports of up to 400 people slaughtered in a single atrocity in the town of Darayya.

Our objective remains an end to the violence and a transition to a more democratic and stable Syria.  This is the only way to avoid protracted civil war, the collapse of the Syrian state, an even greater exodus of refugees and further appalling loss of life.

This is not just our view or the view of other Western countries, it is the view of the Arab League and the vast majority of UN member states. And I particularly welcome the recent strong statement by President Mursi of Egypt condemning the Assad regime’s actions.

Despite our best efforts the United Nations Security Council has been unable to put its full weight and authority behind a peaceful resolution of the crisis. On three occasions we have tried with our allies to adopt a Security Council Resolution that would require the regime to begin a political transition, rather than simply call on it to do so. On each occasion Russia and China have used their vetoes, most recently on the 19th July. It is a terrible indictment of the Council that approximately a quarter of all those who have been killed in Syria died in the month following the last vetoed resolution.

We continue to urge Russia and China to work with us to end the crisis and to allow the Security Council to live up to its responsibilities, a case the Prime Minister made to President Putin during August and a case I made again at the Security Council in New York last week. We are also working closely with the new UN/Arab League Special Representative Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, who I met in New York last week as well.

But in the absence of that international unity, we have sharply increased our work to help the people of Syria in five areas:

Helping to create the conditions for a political transition;

Providing further humanitarian aid;

Increasing the pressure on the regime;

Supporting justice for victims human rights violations;

And planning assistance to a future Syrian government.

In each case our actions are carefully coordinated with our partners, and I organised a conference call in mid-August with Secretary Clinton and the Foreign Ministers of France, Germany and Turkey to ensure that that is the case.

I will briefly take each of these five areas in turn.

First, a political transition requires the Assad regime to stop the violence. But it also requires Syria’s opposition groups to win the trust of the Syrian people and provide a united and viable political alternative. So we are greatly increasing our work with opposition groups and political activists from Syria.

The UK’s own Special Representative to the Syrian Opposition continues to meet oppositionist groups in the region, and last month I authorised his first limited contacts with political representatives of the Free Syria Army outside the country.

On 10th August I announced an extra £5 million pounds in non-lethal practical assistance to help protect unarmed opposition groups and human rights activists in Syria, including communications equipment, training to support the documentation of human rights violations, and other equipment for civilians. Communications equipment is en route to Syria as I speak.

We have already trained over 60 Syrian activists in documenting human rights violations, and provided support including equipment for 100 Syrian citizen journalists to report on events in Syria. Activists who helped investigate the massacre in El-Houleh for example were trained by the United Kingdom.

The new assistance I announced on 10th August is designed to support similar work and to help save lives.  All the support we provide will be carefully targeted, coordinated with like-minded countries, consistent with our laws and values, and based on rigorous analysis and risk assessment.

Second, action to address the humanitarian crisis. The UK is the second largest bilateral donor to the Syrian people. Since July our aid has provided food to over 145,000 people, water and sanitation for up to 60,000 people, and health care for over 50,000 people.

In August my right honourable friend the International Development Secretary announced a four-fold increase in UK assistance for Syrian refugees. And at the UN Security Council last week I announced a further increase in UK aid from £27.5 million to £30.5 million. It includes £2 million in new funding for medical aid inside Syria and £1 million for refugees in Jordan, particularly those who have been victims of sexual violence - a particular focus for our Government ahead of the UK’s G8 Presidency in 2013.

As I saw when I visited the Jordanian border with Syria last month to meet refugees, the need is growing. As of last week, the $180 million UN Humanitarian Response Plan was only half funded. There is an urgent need for other countries to help make up the shortfall. To that end in New York I proposed with the French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius that Development Ministers and UN agencies meet to help generate donations and coordinate assistance.

And through the Conflict Pool, we are also increasing our bilateral support to the Government and Armed Forces of Lebanon as they grapple with insecurity caused by Syria’s conflict.

Third, the UK has been at the forefront of efforts to isolate the Assad regime and cut off its finance. We have led the way on 17 rounds of EU sanctions on Syria since last May, targeting now 155 individuals and 55 entities close to the regime.

Senior Syrian military officers and diplomats are joining senior members of the government in courageously turning their back on Assad, including former Prime Minister Riad Hijab. Foreign Minister Fabius and I also called at the UN for others around Bashar Al-Assad to follow Mr Hijab’s example and disassociate themselves from the regime.

This leads into our fourth area of work, supporting justice for the Syrian people and helping to deter crimes.

The UN Human Rights Council Commission of Inquiry has reported human rights violations on an appalling scale by the regime and its militia, and also abuses by some armed groups.

A list of individuals and units believed to be responsible for human rights violations and abuses will be submitted by the Commission at the end of this month, for the purposes of holding to account those responsible for atrocities. We strongly believe that the Commission’s mandate should be extended so it can continue this vital work.

We also support the initiative by the Swiss Government to build momentum for a referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court, and urge others to join these efforts. If these do not succeed we look forward to a day when a different kind of government in place in Syria will take responsibility for voluntarily referring the situation to the International Criminal Court.

The UK’s expert Human Rights Monitoring mission visited the region earlier this year.  We will continue to work to help improve the quality of information and evidence gathered by Syrian human rights activists which may be used in a future accountability process.

Fifth, Assad’s departure from power is inevitable. His regime is doomed, and the international community must plan rapid support to a new government in Syria now.

Any such government will face a broad range of challenges from reforming the security sector and restoring health and education services, to ensuring people have shelter, water and food.

So FCO officials are working closely with DFID, MOD and the Stabilisation Unit, and also with key allies in the Friends of Syria including regional countries, so that we develop and coordinate plans for assistance now.

Madame Deputy Speaker, this crisis began when the people of Syria demanded their legitimate rights and freedoms. The Assad regime has tried to crush their aspirations and extinguish their hope. We will use all diplomatic means available to us to help them, working with the UN, the Friends of Syria Group, the European Union, Arab countries and key allies such as France, the United States and Turkey. As I have said to the House before, we have not ruled out any options as this crisis deepens. At the UN General Assembly later this month we will seek once again to generate the determined, concerted international action that the situation demands and that Syrian people have every right to expect.",Increased humanitarian aid and planning assistance to a future Syrian government,Welfare,,id25_43

The visit is an important part of the step change the UK wants to see in its relationship with the wider Latin America region.,Foreign & Commonwealth Office,22 November 2011,"During his visit the President met the Queen, Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Foreign Secretary and other senior Ministers to discuss how the UK and Colombia can strengthen their bilateral ties.

Speaking after his meeting with the Colombian President, the Foreign Secretary said:

“President Santos and I held a productive and wide-ranging discussion. His visit has highlighted how much our countries have in common, our shared history and our desire to deepen and broaden our relationship.”

“During the last two days our countries have agreed to double two-way trade to £1.75 billion by 2015. The UK will continue to provide technical assistance to Colombia on a wide range of issues, including Private Public Partnerships, OECD accession plans and land rights.

“Furthermore we will deepen our relations in new areas such as science, innovation and green growth. We have signed a number of co-operation agreements to strengthen collaboration on higher education.

“We welcome President Santos’s commitment to zero tolerance of human rights abuses. I commend the progress already made, in particular his government’s ambitious plans for returning land to those displaced by the internal conflict. Our two governments have agreed a Joint Declaration on Human Rights. We will continue to support Colombia’s work to make further progress in this area.

“At the UN and elsewhere, the UK and Colombia continue to have a strong partnership on international security and on counter narcotics. We look forward to continuing to work together at the UN Security Council.

“We are renewing and reinvigorating our relationship with Latin America. Colombia is a country that matters to the UK. I look forward to seeing this relationship flourish in the months and years to come.”

The two countries agreed to double two-way trade to £1.75 billion by 2015. The UK and Colombia also agreed to broaden relations in new areas such as science and innovation and green growth, and sign a number of co-operation agreements to strengthen collaboration on higher education.

The UK and Colombia agreed ajoint declaration on human rightson 21 November.

The visit comes as President Santos continues with wide-ranging domestic reforms aimed at  increasing security and returning land to those left dispossessed by internal conflict.

President Santos will give the Canning Lecture at Mansion House: a year after William Hague became the first Foreign Secretary to do so.

In his speech the Foreign Secretary had committed the UK to engaging more closely with Latin America, and to increasing its diplomatic presence in the region.

Foreign Office Minister Jeremy Browne said:

“Despite Colombia’s strong economic credentials, at present it is only the UK’s fifth largest export market in Latin America. There is so much more potential to be realised across the whole spectrum of sectors.

“I hope that the visit of President Santos will lead to an enhanced relationship in our important traditional areas of cooperation, like counter-narcotics and human rights, but also in those areas where we have made a good start but need too more, like trade, economic policy, education and climate change.

“I want our businesses to think of Colombia when they are choosing export markets. I want our universities and research institutes to make Colombia a priority for the their international outreach. And I want Colombia to think of the UK as a partner of choice.”",Agreement to double two-way trade to £1.75 billion by 2015; Agreement to broaden relations in new areas such as science and innovation and green growth; signing of co-operation agreements to strengthen collaboration on higher education; Joint Declaration on Human Rights.,Monetary,Market-based,id25_46

The work to rebuild Libya is just beginning and there are undoubtedly challenges ahead. But it is important to remember what has been achieved. A brutal tyrant has been overthrown. Libyan assets have been unfrozen and can now be accessed to benefit the Libyan people. The recent publication of the elections law is an important step in preparing for elections in June, marking the transition to an open and democratic era. Civil society is flourishing for the first time in 40 years and people can voice their views freely.

The opposition side in Libya are also becoming steadily better organised.”

He said one of the areas the Contact Group will look at is providing a funding mechanism to the opposition-held areas:

“The United Kingdom isn’t necessarily donating to that, although we’re helping with other non-lethal assistance. We’ve sent telecommunications equipment that we believe will save lives, so I think we have achieved a great deal in the last few weeks.”

Responding to claims that the Coalition forces acted “hastily” on action in Libya the Foreign Secretary said:

“Unless we had acted that day, on that Saturday in March, many thousands of people would have been killed, there would have been a humanitarian crisis costing us a great deal more than this situation with all the destabilising consequences for Egypt and Tunisia as well. So that is why we acted hastily and now we will follow it through to success.”

He went on to say that the military mission is defined by the UN resolutions:

“We will at all times keep the legal and moral and international authority that comes from acting within those United Nations resolutions.  That imposes some constraints, of course, on military action, and we impose on ourselves the constraint of trying to avoid at all times civilian casualties.  But within those constraints we are seeking to protect civilian life, to promote an end to violence in Libya.”

“The reports of a massacre in the town of Traymseh in Hama district are shocking and appalling.

“More than 200 men, women and children appear to have been killed in this latest atrocity. Everything we have seen of the Syrian regime’s behaviour over the last seventeen months suggests that these reports are credible. They demand a united response from the international community.

“We have two urgent priorities - to establish an accurate account of what happened in Traymseh so that those responsible can and will be held to account; and to agree urgent action at the United Nations Security Council.

“To that end, the UN Mission in Syria must be able to access Traymseh quickly and without hindrance so they can carry out an independent investigation into what has happened and who is responsible.

This would compel the Syrian regime to fulfil the commitments it has made under the Annan Plan, to withdraw its military from residential areas, and establish a transitional government as called for by Kofi Annan and endorsed by the P5 and Arab League.  It should be a legally binding Security Council Resolution with teeth, that creates a trigger for sanctions if the Assad regime does not comply.

“In my statement of 4 March, I updated the House on the Rural Payments Agency’s (RPA), progress in both addressing its daunting legacy of errors in relation to the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) and ensuring that accurate payments under the SPS 2010 reached farmers as soon as possible. In that statement I explained I was considering additional measures to speed the flow of SPS 2010 payments and, following discussions in the RPA Oversight Board, I can now report on the decisions that have been reached.

“Since 4 March, RPA has continued to make SPS 2010 payments as claims are validated and to undertake further work to identify those that are ineligible and not, therefore, due a payment for this year. As a result, the Agency calculates that there are now in the region of 6,300 eligible claims remaining to be paid, with a combined value of around £215 million.

“The frustrations felt by these farmers have been made very clear to me, both directly and through farmers’ representative bodies. They want both the remaining sums paid as soon as possible and a line to be drawn under the legacy issues so uncertainty over past years is removed and greater confidence is provided that subsequent scheme year payments will not be affected. The Oversight Board shares these aims and has been looking very closely how the former can be achieved without significantly impacting on the latter.

“Against that background, the Oversight Board has now approved two decisions which between them should ensure that less than one per cent of the monetary value of SPS 2010 payments remains outstanding at the end of the regulatory payment window which closes on 30 of June. This would be in line with, or would better, performance in previous years and would ensure the EU requirement to make 95.238 per cent of payments by 30 June is met thus avoiding late payment penalties.

“The first decision is that, after rigorous testing on a sample to ensure accuracy of the process, fully validated manual payments will be made to approximately 2,000 farmers under the 2010 scheme who would otherwise not be paid until after the payment window. These payments will be made over the next two months and take account of known entitlement corrections that have yet to be fully processed on the Agency’s systems. Should there be any additional changes identified once payment has been made, the farmers concerned will be informed.

“The second decision relates to those remaining SPS 2010 payments where there are outstanding queries on earlier scheme years. Where the SPS 2010 claim has been fully validated, payment for that scheme year will now be made. Should any changes be identified for earlier scheme year payments in due course, the farmers concerned will be informed. RPA plan to complete the work required before the opening of the SPS 2011 payment window on 1 of December.

“The net result of these decisions is that the flow of remaining SPS 2010 payments will now increase. The Oversight Board did additionally consider requests from various sectors of the industry to make partial payments. However, RPA’s analysis suggests that this would not significantly increase the speed at which remaining claims are paid to farmers, but would add disproportionately to the backlog of corrective work required and introduce additional risks of EU fines. Consequently, it was agreed that the Agency should not make partial payments.

“In order that all farmers with payments outstanding at the end of March understand how these decisions might affect them, RPA will be writing to each of those concerned next week to explain what issues remain on their claims and the likely month of payment.

“Alongside this work, RPA will continue to review the remaining backlog of potential error cases that need to be reviewed. Corrective work undertaken to date, combined with earlier decisions by the Oversight Board on ensuring entitlements were regularised wherever legally possible, has made a real impact to date. The Board will be monitoring these efforts closely to ensure a line is finally drawn under all the legacy data issues over the coming year.”

In recognition of the difficulty that farmers affected may face, Jim Paice has written to the directors of the main banks, asking them to alert their staff to the situation and asking them to be understanding in meeting reasonable requests by farmers for assistance and urging them to share his aim that no otherwise viable farming business fails because of cash flow issues related to the timing of SPS payments.",Writing to banks to request assistance for farmers,Other,,id25_54

The Conference followed six years of work in the UN to secure a legally binding Treaty to regulate the international trade in conventional arms. The illegal, or poorly regulated, trade in conventional arms costs lives and blights futures.  More than 740,000 men, women and children die each year as a result of armed violence.

The UK has led international efforts to secure an ATT over the last six years, and last month the UN Conference came close to reaching an agreement on a Treaty.

The UK Delegation was led by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and comprised of representatives from the Ministry of Defence, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Department for International Development and a representative from the UK Defence Industry. I and the Minister of State for International Development also travelled to New York during the negotiations to help sustain the momentum of the process.  The UK Delegation played a leading role in the negotiations, co-ordinating closely with civil society, and supported by Ministers and officials from across Whitehall and by the UK’s extensive network of international Posts. I pay tribute to all the individuals involved.

Four weeks of difficult and complex negotiations led to a robust and balanced Treaty text which the United Kingdom and the vast majority of other states felt able to support.  However on the final day of the Conference a small number of countries asked for more time to consider the text, meaning that the Conference ended without agreement.  As the Foreign Secretary made clear in his statement of 28 July, we were disappointed that the negotiations did not reach a conclusion.  However we recognise that to be fully effective the Treaty will need broad and ideally universal participation.

This is not an end to the Arms Trade Treaty process. We are absolutely committed to securing a robust and effective Treaty, and will continue to devote significant diplomatic efforts to this goal. We will continue our work on the basis of the draft Treaty considered at the Conference. The UN General Assembly will be the next opportunity for us to address the issue amongst the whole UN membership. Whilst there is still work to be done, we remain optimistic that a meaningful and coherent ATT that will make a positive difference to millions of lives is in reach, and our goal will be its agreement during the next UN General Assembly session in 2012 - 2013.",Continued diplomatic efforts to secure a robust and effective Treaty,Other,,id25_55

“This was my message during my visit to Morocco last month where I discussed political reform and declared our willingness to support projects to increase political participation and promote transparency in public institutions through our Arab Partnership Initiative.  I also met representatives from a broad range of political parties to discuss the opportunities and challenges they face and was impressed by the willingness of the parties to promote popular participation in the political process.

The three axis accelerometer sensors, which can detect movement in any direction just as in Nintendo Wii remote controls, will be used to learn more about the habits of fish by studying how they move about and measuring their metabolic rate.

Fisheries Minister Richard Benyon said:

“This certainly brings a new meaning to fish and chips. It is incredible to think that the same technology we use to play computer games could eventually help us in our predictions of future fish stocks. This shows the ingenuity of our scientists in striving to improve our understanding of the natural world.”

Cefas have already trialled an electronic tag which can log every time a fish opens its mouth, which they can use to track when a fish is breathing, feeding, coughing or yawning. The tag can also determine the fish’s location.

The tags, which cost up to £800 each to produce and have been funded by Defra, work by installing a magnet in the jaw of a fish, with a sensor that reads the changes in the magnetic field as it opens and closes its mouth.

The scientists found that the tag was so successful at keeping track of fish activity in its trials that they are now planning to use a full production version to monitor feeding in wild cod in the open seas.

The sensors are helping Cefas scientists to get a better picture of fish behaviour - such as when, where and how often they eat - which in turn will help scientists understand more about fish stocks sustainability, and the distribution and abundance of their food sources.

Following the success trial with the electric tag, attention is now turning to developing the Wii-style sensors to give an even better picture of fish activity in the wild.

Telephone interviews with the scientist behind the research can be arranged by contacting the Defra Press Office.",Electronic tag technology and sensor development,Other,Market-based,id25_57

Mr Speaker, I would like to update the House on actions we are taking to protect civilians in Libya and other issues of concern in the Middle East.

First I must confirm the sad news that a British national was killed in a bus bombing in Jerusalem yesterday, which injured over 30 Israelis, 8 of them seriously. Her family were informed last night. Our Embassy in Tel Aviv and Consulate General in Jerusalem are doing everything possible to assist her family and those who were travelling with her. The House will join me in sending our deepest condolences to her family at this tragic time, as well our solidarity with the people of Israel in the face of such a shocking and despicable act of terrorism. I condemn this attack in the strongest terms and call for those responsible to be held to account.

I am also gravely concerned about renewed rocket attacks on Israel from Gaza and the deaths of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. I urge all parties to restore calm and work to achieve the two states which are the only lasting hope for peace.

Turning to Libya, we continue to take robust action to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1973 which authorised military action to put in place a no-fly zone to prevent air attacks on Libyan people, and to take all necessary measures to stop attacks on civilians while ruling out an occupation force.

The case for this action remains utterly compelling. Appalling violence against Libyan citizens continues to take place, exposing the regime’s claims to have ordered a ceasefire to be an utter sham.

Misrata has been under siege for days by regime ground forces, although coalition airstrikes are helping to relieve the pressure on its citizens, many of whom have been trapped in their homes without electricity or communications, with dwindling supplies of food and water and facing sniper fire if they venture into the streets, while the local hospital is swamped with casualties.

Ajdabiya continues to be under attack, with reports of civilian deaths from tank shells. This underlines the appalling danger its inhabitants would be in without coalition action, as do continued threats by Qadhafi forces to “massacre” residents in areas under bombardment.

Mr Speaker there is universal condemnation of what the Libyan regime is doing from the United Nations, the Arab League, the African Union and from Europe. The regime’s actions strengthen our resolve to continue our current operations and our support for the work of the International Criminal Court.

Our action is saving lives and is protecting hundreds of thousands of civilians in Benghazi and Mistrata from the fate that otherwise awaited them. That is what UN Security Council Resolution 1973 was for and that is why we are implementing it. We are taking the utmost care to minimise the risk of civilian casualties. The only forces acting indiscriminately or deliberately inflicting casualties are the forces of the Qadhafi regime.

UK forces have undertaken a total of 59 aerial missions over Libya in addition to air and missile strikes. Last night, our forces again participated in a co-ordinated strike against Libyan air defence systems. A No Fly Zone has now been established and the regime’s integrated air defence system has been comprehensively degraded. There are no Libyan military aircraft flying.

Over 150 planes coalition planes have been involved in military operations, including Typhoon and Tornado aircraft from the Royal Air Force. 13 nations have currently deployed aircraft to the region. A number of additional nations have made offers of aircraft and other military support which are in the process of being agreed. Royal Navy vessels are in the region supporting the arms embargo.

These coalition operations are currently under United States command.  But we want them to transition to NATO command and control as quickly as possible. NATO has already launched its operation to enforce the arms embargo. Its planning is complete for the no-fly zone. And we are making progress in NATO taking on all measures under Resolution 1973 needed to protect civilians from Qadhafi’s attacks. We need agreement to unified command and control for it to be robust, and we expect to get that agreement soon.

Resolution 1973 lays out very clear conditions that must be met including an immediate ceasefire, a halt to all attacks on civilians and full humanitarian access to those in need. We will continue our efforts until these conditions are fulfilled. The Libyan regime will be judged by its actions not its words.

Our message to the Qadhafi regime is that the international community will not stand by and watch them kill civilians, a view this House overwhelming endorsed this week. To his forces we say that if they continue to take part in Qadhafi’s war against his own people, they will continue to face the military force of the coalition, and if they commit crimes against Libyan people they will be held to account.

Mr Speaker I announced yesterday that Britain will host an international conference next Tuesday to take forward the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1973. We are inviting NATO allies, key international organisations including the UN, the Arab League and the African Union and many Arab nations.

We continue to engage in intensive diplomatic activity to increase the multilateral pressure on the Libyan regime. Further UN and EU sanctions have been agreed targeting Qadhafi and his associates, and against those Libyan organisations responsible for funding his regime. As of today the European Union has designated the National Oil Corporation of Libya, cutting the regime off from any future oil revenues.

We are gravely concerned for the well-being of up to 80,000 internally displaced persons. The Secretary of State for International Development is in close communication with his counterparts in international organisations about immediate and longer-term humanitarian support to the Libyan people.

Mr Speaker, it is not for us to choose the government of Libya - that is for the Libyan people themselves. But they have a far greater chance of making that choice now than seemed likely on Saturday, when the opposition forces were on the verge of defeat and the lives of so many were in danger.

We continue to deepen our contacts with the Libyan opposition, including the Interim National Council based in Benghazi. I spoke to Mahmoud Jabril, Special Envoy of Council, on Tuesday to discuss the situation on the ground and to invite him to visit London. In the words of the Arab League resolution, the current regime has completely lost its legitimacy. We call on all those, including the INTC, who believe that Colonel Qadhafi has led the people of Libya into an impasse, to begin to organise a transition process.

In Syria there are reports of many deaths and the use of live round after security forces cleared a mosque in Deraa. We call on the Government of Syria to respect their people’s right to peaceful protest and to take action about their legitimate grievances.  We also call for utmost restraint on all sides, including by the Syrian security forces, during the further protests in Syria that have been called for tomorrow.

In Bahrain, we support a process of dialogue leading to political reform that can address the legitimate aspirations of all the people of Bahrain, and I urge all parties to join without preconditions the proposed national dialogue.

In Yemen, a state of emergency has been declared by the Government and a ‘Day of Marches’ is planned in Sana’a tomorrow. There has been looting and disorder in that city and other cities and over 50 protesters died in Sana’a last Friday.  We call even now on the opposition and the Government to engage in dialogue.

There are still some British nationals who have chosen to remain in Yemen. Since October last year we have been unable to provide consular assistance in Yemen because of the significant terrorist threat. There are many parts of Yemen that the Ambassador and his staff are unable to reach. In light of the rapidly deteriorating security situation and the protests tomorrow I have temporarily withdrawn part of the British Embassy team in Sana’a, leaving a small core of staff in place.

Commercial flights to and from Yemen are still operating, although this could clearly change. Should there be further violence in Yemen normal means of leaving, particularly through the commercial airport in Sana’a, could be blocked, and the ability to travel around Yemen will be severely restricted. On 12 March we advised all British Nationals to leave Yemen as soon as they could. Since the situation has deteriorated further since then, I want to make absolutely clear today that all British Nationals remaining in Yemen should leave without delay.

Mr Speaker, the United Kingdom believes that the people of all these countries must be able to determine their own futures. That is why in all of them we argue for reform not repression, and why in Libya, supported by the full authority of the United Nations, we have acted to save many lives threatened by one of the most repressive regimes of them all. This will continue to be our approach as change continues to gather pace in the Middle East.",UN Security Council Resolution 1973,Legislative,,id25_58

The Foreign Secretary continues his personal mission to crack down on the full spectrum of Russian malign activity.

The US and Canada sign up to the shadow fleet ‘Call to Action’ launched by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer in July, bringing the total number of signatories to 47.

The UK has today unleashed the largest package of sanctions to date against Putin’s shadow fleet of oil tankers.18 more shadow fleet ships will be barred from UK ports and unable to access world-leading British maritime services, bringing the total number of oil tankers sanctioned to 43.

The shadow fleet seeks to undermine sanctions and poses a clear and present danger. Environmental risks, such as oil spills, on our coastlines as a result of its flagrant violation of basic safety standards, but also risks to the security of global trade – the lifeblood of economic growth.

At the European Political Community Summit in July, the Prime Minister announced the shadow fleet call to action. Today the US and Canada have joined 44 European countries plus the EU in working together to tackle the risks posed by the shadow fleet.

The UK’s relentless action against the shadow fleet is putting grit into the system and starving Putin’s war machine of crucial revenues. The oil tankers targeted today have transported an estimated $4.9 billion in the last year alone. A significant number of the ships targeted by the UK to date have been forced to sit idling uselessly outside ports across the world, unable to continue pouring money into Putin’s war chest.

Sovcomflot, Russia’s largest shipping company, has been left desperately scrambling to rename and offload its vessels to dodge UK sanctions. Today we have targeted even more of its ships, further turning the screw on the mechanisms the Kremlin uses to fund its illegal war.

Alongside action against the shadow fleet, the UK is sanctioning 4 more LNG tankers and Russian gas company Rusgazdobycha JSC. We are continuing to ratchet up pressure on the beleaguered Russian gas industry, with flagship company Gazprom posting a significant net loss of $6.9 billion in 2023 - its first annual loss in more than 20 years.

Foreign Secretary, David Lammy said:

We must combat malign Russian activity at every turn, whether illicit tactics to bolster Putin’s war chest, their use of cyber-attacks or barbarism on the front line in Ukraine.

The UK is leading the charge against Putin’s desperate and dangerous attempts to cling on to his energy revenues, with his shadow fleet placing coastlines across Europe and the world in jeopardy.

I have made it my personal mission to constrain the Kremlin, closing the net around Putin and his mafia state using every tool at my disposal.

This new shadow fleet package comes in the weeks following recent UK actions to sanction both Russian cyber-crime gang Evil Corp, and Russian troops found to be using chemical weapons on the front lines in Ukraine. It represents the latest in a drumbeat of activity, with each package designed to target a distinct aspect of Russia’s malign behavior and reinforce the UK’s commitment to global security and the rule of law.

Separately, the UK is taking steps to combat malign, Russian-backed maritime activity near the UK:

The Department for Transport is working alongside the Joint Maritime Security Centre (JMSC) and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) to challenge shadow fleet vessels with suspected dubious insurance to provide details of their insurance status as they pass through the English Channel.

Mr Abdul Jalil met the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for International Development, the Shadow Foreign Secretary and me.

In line with our assessment of the NTC as the legitimate interlocutor in Libya representing the aspirations of the Libyan people, the Government has invited the NTC to establish an office in the UK. This will enhance our existing relationship with the NTC, and better enable us to fulfil our commitment to protect civilians under threat of attack from the Qadhafi regime. It will help us to work more closely together on sharing information and formulating our policy towards Libya. This arrangement does not affect our position on the legal status of the NTC: the British Government will continue to recognise States, not Governments. The UK will also strengthen its presence in Eastern Libya when our new Permanent Head of Office in Benghazi John Jenkins arrives in the near future.

In parallel to this, the UK will be a key contributor to the deployment of a multi-national team of experts to Benghazi. With the UN still unable to deploy, this team will conduct a stabilisation assessment, and advise and assist the NTC on meeting their longer-term needs. I also intend to provide further practical and material support to the NTC in the form of further communications equipment, bullet proof vests and uniforms for the civilian police authorities. I also intend to provide support for the NTC’s fledging media and broadcasting operations.

As with all the material and advisory support we are providing to the NTC, this support is within the terms of UN Security Council Resolutions 1970 and 1973 on Libya.

Participants including Richard Northern British Ambassador to Libya, Abdurrahman Shalgham, former Libyan Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Philippe Sands Professor of Law University College London and Michael O’Flaherty Vice-Chairperson United Nations Human Rights Committee, discussed  the human rights situation in Libya and how to ensure human rights considerations are at the heart of UK policy.



Following the conference Alistair Burt Minister for the Middle East said:

“This event was an important and salient reminder of the Libyan regime’s appalling human rights record, and it helped to further underline the importance of the international community’s actions to protect the Libyan people from the Qadhafi regime.

The forum was also a useful opportunity for UK policy makers to engage with a wide range of experts from lawyers, to academics, to diplomats and leading journalists. These discussions and perspectives will inform UK policy making towards the situation in Libya”.",Statements by Alistair Burt,Informational,,id25_67

“I am concerned by the decision of the Mercosur group of countries to prevent ships that fly the flag of the Falkland Islands from entering their ports. Falklands-flagged vessels have been regular visitors to South American ports for 150 years.

“It is not yet clear what the practical impact of the Mercosur statement might be as it reflects similar language used in the region previously. Some countries take a different view from us on our sovereignty of the Falkland Islands. It is for the people of the Falkland Islands to determine their future. It is unacceptable to engage in an economic blockade of the Falklands. Mercosur should take the responsible decision and not do this. There can be no justification - legal, moral or political - for efforts to intimidate the people of the Falkland Islands.

“I have instructed our Ambassadors in the region to raise this issue as a matter of urgency to clarify exactly whether or how Mercosur countries propose to implement this agreement. We will then consider our next steps in light of information we  receive. But no one should be in any doubt about the British Government’s commitment to support the Falkland Islanders’ right to determine their own political future.”

Speaking today he said:

“I congratulate the government and people of South Sudan on the anniversary of the birth of the world’s newest nation. One year ago today, I attended Independence Day celebrations in Juba, the capital of South Sudan, and officially opened the UK’s Embassy there. I promised the South Sudanese people that the United Kingdom would work with them to build stability and prosperity, based on lasting peace with South Sudan’s neighbours, full integration into the region and strong co-operation with the international community.

“The events of the past year have underlined the importance of strong political leadership in achieving peace and building a successful nation which will benefit all the people of South Sudan. I call on the Governments of South Sudan and Sudan to demonstrate that leadership now, by creating a lasting peace with each other which will allow both nations to thrive. The UK will continue to offer its full support to South Sudan as it builds a more secure and prosperous future.”

Britain was the first country to accredit an ambassador to the new country, and with its substantial development and humanitarian programme, has led the way in taking forward the commitments made by the international community to address the pressing needs of the South Sudanese people.

Twelve months on, the challenges facing the new country are more evident than ever. South Sudan needs to settle its remaining differences with the Republic of Sudan, so that its people can reap the full benefits from the economic rewards that peace will bring, and focus on building a state that makes the most of the their country’s rich agricultural, mineral, and human potential.

The successful businesses beat hopefuls looking to address flooding and the effects of climate change in local communities through developing innovative technology.

Congratulating the winners, Environment Minister Lord de Mauley said:

“This year we saw weeks of heavy rain and flooding across the country and we witnessed the devastation extreme weather can cause, especially to the rural economy. The effects of climate change and flooding is only likely to increase.

“These businesses have created exciting ways to combat climate change and the effects of flooding in our communities. The competition has encouraged people to think about tackling the problems the environment throws at us, and I hope these make it into production along with many of the other ideas we have seen.”

The entrepreneurs competed in a ‘Dragons Den’ style competition. The funding will help bring two products and a concept into production but it has also encouraged people to think about tackling climate change and flooding and brought the ideas to the attention of the private sector who will hopefully develop other ideas further.

FloodBrick a stackable flood barrier was one successful bid who will see their pitch become a reality. The competition winners were:

The prize fund forms part of Defra’s work to protect peoples home from flooding and adapt to climate change.

Simon Phelps, Managing Director, Fluvial Innovations Ltd said:

“It is absolutely fantastic news that Fluvial I_nnovations, FloodBrick_ has been selected to win the Climate Change award.

“The money will make a big difference to Fluvial Innovations, we are now able to develop the FloodBrick, a range of temporary flood prevention barriers that are not only extremely cost-effective but functional.  We plan to manufacture a prototype, then test and commercialise it.

“Having developed and supplied our existing flood barrier range (Floodstop) over the past 7-years; we have gained an acute awareness of what the market demands in the future - namely simplicity and low cost.

“It’s great funding like this is available to help UK businesses like us, drive innovations forward.”

The projects that won the funding will aim to showcase their products in June 2013.

Notes

The Government are investing £2.17billion on flood prevention through to 2015 and also recently announced an additional £120million to speed up the delivery of 50 schemes that will protect up to 60,000 homes from flooding and coastal erosion and unlock development and benefit the economy. The Government is already on course to deliver better protection to 145,000 homes by 2015.

The Defra funded - Technology Standard Board competition is the first of two rounds, with an additional £200,000 funding available for round two. The second round of the competition will be launched in summer 2013. The Government does not endorse the use of specific products.

72,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/britain-and-turkey-a-new-special-relationship,News story,Britain and Turkey: a new special relationship,Foreign Secretary William Hague said the case for a strong bilateral partnership between Britain and Turkey has never been stronger.,Foreign & Commonwealth Office and The Rt Hon William Hague,22 November 2011,"“Last year within three months of becoming Prime Minister, David Cameron arrived in Ankara. When asked “Why Turkey?” and, “Why so soon?” he said: because Turkey is vital for our economy, vital for our security and vital for our politics and our diplomacy.

Turkey is one of the world’s fastest growing economies. A young, energetic and entrepreneurial workforce - over half the population is under 29 years old - is an integral part of the success story. Analysts predict that Turkey will be one of the world’s top ten economies by 2050. As we recover from the current economic crisis, the case for a strong bilateral partnership between Britain and Turkey has never been stronger.

This week’s State Visit to the UK by Turkey’s President, Abdullah Gul, reminds us that Turkey is a country that is developing a new role and new links for itself, within and beyond existing structures and alliances. The UK and Turkey have a strong relationship across the range of foreign policy and security issues. Over the last 18 months we have laid firm foundations for that relationship through an ambitious Strategic Partnership which prompted the Turkish Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to say that relations with the UK had entered a “golden age.” Indeed they have.

Since the Partnership was signed, we have established a UK-Turkey CEO Forum, composed of around 25 of the most senior business figures from our two countries to discuss the strategic issues that will deliver profitable business for the future. This week’s State Visit provides a platform for forging deeper commercial partnerships. By the end of this year, trade is expected to reach £9 billion, representing a 40% increase since 2009. British companies concerned about falling demand for their products should extend their reach now to Turkey. Many, such as Vodafone, Diageo and Tesco are already doing so.

Turkey is vital for our security: we work together as NATO allies across the world. In Afghanistan, we share the same objectives. Turkish troops and diplomacy are making vital contributions towards the creation of a more secure future, most recently with the valuable discussions at the Istanbul Conference on regional support for Afghanistan. Closer to home, in the Western Balkans we are working together to secure the gains made in the last 16 years to bring stability to the region

Our counter-terrorism experts met in London last week to discuss how we can strengthen cooperation in countering radicalisation and tackling the scourge of PKK terrorism. Turkey also shares our concerns on immigration. We have developed a number of joint projects to stem the flow of illegal migrants entering the EU from central and southern Asia.

Turkey’s important role in the Middle East and North Africa region is clear. Many of those who have taken to the streets during the Arab Spring for a more just, representative form of government have, in Turkey, a very successful example of modern democracy in a largely Muslim country. I’m struck by the contrast between the anxiety in some quarters about the EU’s future role in the world, and the self-confident approach Turkey has taken in recent months to driving forward international collaboration on issues ranging from Afghanistan to Somalia. On Syria, Turkey has played an important role, pressing the regime to stop the violence and engaging with international partners, particularly the Arab League, to intensify wider pressure on Assad.

It’s clear that the UK and our fellow Member States in the EU will have to contend with rapid change and uncertainty in our neighbourhood, across north Africa to central Asia, in the coming years. Few countries are better placed to influence events in this vital region than Turkey. We already benefit from this. My Turkish counterpart, Ahmet Davutoglu, is making active and astute contributions on issues at the heart of the EU’s foreign policy agenda.

Since the launch of EU accession negotiations in 2005, Turkey has taken important strides towards meeting EU standards on human rights, democracy and governance. Turkey has abolished the death penalty, introduced a zero-tolerance approach to torture, improved rights for women and minority groups and, most recently, taken steps to compensate religious foundations. There is still some way to go, but the Turkish Government has committed itself to further progress through a new constitution that will meet the aspirations and demands of a modern democracy and truly represent the interests of all citizens of Turkey. And we want to encourage our Turkish friends to do even more.

And we want to send a message of a full support for energetic Turkish negotiations with the EU. It is deeply disappointing that these have been grindingly slow. If they continue with the same tempo the risk is that Turkish public opinion, traditionally in favour of entry into the EU, will turn against it and an historic opportunity will have been spurned. This is in no-one’s interest. I call on Turkey to keep its patience and determination to join the EU, and also on our EU partners to keeping working towards a goal that is in our common interests.

Economic uncertainty within the EU and political uncertainty on the continent’s southern and eastern borders should be pulling the EU and Turkey together, not pushing them apart. Turkish accession would bring fresh energy to the Single Market. Europe’s influence overseas needs the leverage that a successful democracy in a largely Muslim country would bring. Together, as I believe this week’s State Visit will demonstrate, the UK and Turkey can help chart a safe course through the current global political and economic storm.”",UK-Turkey CEO Forum,Institutional,,id25_72

“The PrepCom this week and next will be an opportunity for the States Parties to reaffirm their commitment and to assess progress against the Action Plan, building on the success of 2010.

Now the Government is launching a new plan to help UK businesses benefit from the multi-billion global market in extracting and reusing these valuable metals.

Faced with a rising global demand for consumer goods and an increasing reliance on speciality metals from abroad, Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman today published the Resource Security Action Plan to make sure UK businesses are more resilient to any changes in supply and price, and can make the most of new opportunities.

China produces over 95 per cent of rare earth elements, with Russia and the Democratic Republic of Congo leading production of other key materials that are used in everyday technology such as mobile phones.  Eighty per cent of Chief Executives surveyed by EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, said that raw materials shortages were a risk to their business in 2012.

The UK is one of the first countries to bring business and civil society into the heart of plans to make sure UK growth isn’t harmed by potential supply uncertainty, while ensuring new growth opportunities are tapped into.

Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said:

“Businesses are already feeling the heat from uncertainty in the supply of the speciality metals used in mobile phones, medical equipment and aeroplanes.

“We’re working with business to help prepare for these risks - but there is also a multi-billion pound opportunity in the massive amount of valuable metals lost because of how we deal now with products people no longer want.

“I want to see British businesses taking advantage of this golden opportunity to boost growth and jobs through how we design products, while re-using, recycling or substituting valuable metals.”

Business Secretary Vince Cable said:

“There are a wealth of opportunities that exist for businesses to capitalise from the valuable materials that are thrown away in unwanted electrical equipment each year.

“This plan will help UK businesses to better withstand any changes in both supply and price, make the most of emerging growth opportunities, create high-skilled jobs and compete on the world stage.”

The Action Plan aims to develop better coordination between businesses and industry and to make sure everyone is armed with information about the availability of these resources to make the right choices. Key actions include:

WRAP and the Environment Agency’s European Pathways to Zero Waste report assessed potential global recovery opportunities of the EU’s 14 most critical metals and minerals at around $US15 billion.

The Resource Security Action Plan was developed in consultation with business, waste management companies, manufacturing companies including the Confederation of British Industry, EEF (the manufacturers’ organisation), the Aldersgate Group, the Environmental Industries Commission, IEMA, the Green Alliance, Rolls Royce, General Electric, Veolia and Sita.  Many small businesses from minerals and metals producers and user companies also convened on several occasions to advise Ministers on these issues.

Much of the Technology Strategy Board’s £4.5 million ‘collaborative R&D’ programme on resource efficiency is supporting projects to improve materials security, including substitution, and a significant element of WRAP support from its existing £28.8 million budget is channelled into materials efficiency.

Between now and 2020 - the UK will dispose of 12 million tonnes of electronic equipment - a quarter of which will be IT equipment, consumer electronics and display devices which contain around 63 tonnes of palladium, and 17 tonnes of iridium.  At current market prices, this amount of palladium would be worth £1 billion and the iridium, around £380 million.

Almost a quarter of all used or broken electrical and electronic products taken to household recycling centres could easily be fixed and resold, which represents a gross revenue opportunity of £200 million each year.

Speciality metals used in consumer products include:

“Let’s not forget what we’ve achieved in the last few days. Qadhafi, without this resolution, without the action we’ve taken, was setting about attacking Benghazi with, he said, no pity or mercy, to search every household. There would have been a humanitarian disaster as people fled from that, and that at least for now has been averted. And so something very important has been achieved, which is the protection of the civilian population by the action we’ve taken so far.”

Speaking about the ceasefire that was declared by Qadhafi last night the Foreign Secretary said “we will judge him by his actions, not by words.”

“He’s declared a ceasefire just two days before, which was completely disregarded. Every word spoken by the Libyan Foreign Ministry on this turned out to be untruthful because the attacks on opposition forces and on civilians continued.”

It sets out what the Government is doing through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to promote human rights and democratic values around the world, in three principal areas: it documents the serious concerns we have about a range of countries where we are seeking to influence the human rights situation; it assesses progress on thematic issues that cut across geographic boundaries; and it reports on areas where we believe we have seen positive developments over the last year. We have made some significant changes to the format of the Report itself this year, including the introduction of case studies.

“I am determined that we will continue to strengthen and develop the Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s work on human rights. With this in mind, I have decided to allocate an additional £1.5m in 2012 to our human rights programme work, which will be focused in particular on projects to promote freedom of expression online and the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

“I have also decided to introduce changes to make the Foreign Office’s human rights reporting even more responsive to rapidly changing situations. An annual report can only look backwards, yet in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office we monitor and respond to change as it happens and our reporting needs to reflect this. It is sometimes the case that a country not regarded as a ‘country of concern’ at the beginning of the reporting period may experience important human rights developments.

“Over the current reporting period, and for the first time, we will make quarterly decisions on whether systematic reporting on developments in other countries, not listed in the 2011 Report as Countries of Concern, is required.

“This more flexible quarterly reporting will strengthen the assessments we make about which countries should be added to or removed from the list of Countries of Concern in the 2012 Annual report.”

Guest speakers at the event included Human Rights Watch researcher Heba Morayef and Kate Allen, Head of Amnesty International.

He held talks with Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh and visited the Bashabsheh refugee camp near the border with Syria.,Foreign & Commonwealth Office and The Rt Hon William Hague,17 July 2012,"At the refugee camp he announced that theUK would train further human rights activiststo document the appalling abuses being carried out in Syria.

Speaking at a press conference with Foreign Minister Judeh, the Foreign Secretary said:

“It is indeed a pleasure for me to work together with my colleague Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh. We have had many good discussions on this visit and on many other occasions. It has become entirely automatic and normal for us to consult each other about the whole range of foreign policy issues and it’s part of the warm bilateral relationship and very deep, historical bilateral relationship between the United Kingdom and Jordan. We welcomed his Majesty the King to London recently and had many long and productive discussions with each other, and of course there are so many deep personal connections in the relationship between our two countries. We want to strengthen this further and to make sure that it is a thriving relationship for a long-term future.

“At a time of great change in the Arab world and many dangers, we welcome the determination of His Majesty to pursue and to deliver reforms here in Jordan.

“We have discussed, as you have heard, many foreign policy issues. Always very high on our list of discussions is the Middle East Peace Process and the need for Israelis and Palestinians to resume formal negotiations. I pay tribute to the work of Jordan in trying to make sure that happens and trying to put new energy into the MEPP. It’s very important to continue our efforts to do that. The United Kingdom believes strongly in a two-state solution and that will slip away from us unless progress is made in the near future.

“We have also discussed the nuclear negotiations with Iran - the negotiations of the E3+3. We still hope that Iran will respond constructively to the offer that we have made. They have not yet done so in any way that any of the six nations in the E3+3 regard as satisfactory for those negotiations to make progress. We have brought into force very wide-ranging sanctions on Iran. Without progress in the negotiations we will intensify those sanctions in the months ahead. We are determined to prevent nuclear proliferation in the Middle East. The Iranians should not doubt our determination to prevent that coming about.

“But we have of course put a lot of time discussing the horrible situation in Syria and this morning we were able to hear for ourselves the moving and horrifying accounts of what is happening in Syria from people who have managed to escape over the border into safety here in Jordan. These are truly terrible accounts. We met people there who have had no connection with any political activity, let alone violence, and yet they have seen their homes shelled or bombed, and they have seen their homes robbed. Some of them had an extraordinary ordeal of travelling for months in order to get from as far away as Homs into Jordan.

“I want to pay tribute to the Jordanian people for their hospitality and for maintaining at a difficult economic time - for so many countries including Jordan - their generosity and hospitality, which is truly on display with the reception given to people in such desperate need.

“We are doing our best to help. Ten days ago we doubled the humanitarian funding that we give to £17.5 million. This will provide food for 80,000 people and shelter for 9,000 people. It is increasing our support for the UNHCR, some of which comes to the refugees entering Jordan. We will continue to increase that assistance if the needs continue to grow.

“What we have seen today should leave us in no doubt at all that a Chapter VII resolution of the United Nations’ Security Council is required to mandate the implementation of Kofi Annan’s peace plan and a transitional government in Syria with a peaceful political process, and to bring about the imposition of globally agreed sanctions on those who obstruct the implementation of that plan.

“There is no reason now not to agree on such a resolution. We are arguing for it along with other Western and Arab nations at the United Nations’ Security Council. We will continue to argue for it over the coming hours. Of course there are continued disagreements on the Security Council.

“This process is the best hope of averting even greater chaos and bloodshed in Syria in the weeks and the months to come, because that is what I believe we are facing unless the UN Security Council can truly exert itself.

“And those nations who might block such a resolution will have to consider that if they do so they will increasingly be held responsible for the consequences and for the chaos and the bloodshed that is even now becoming worse in Syria as we have seen for ourselves today. So thank you very much. It is always a pleasure working so closely together. Thank you very much for having me here”.

Answering questions the Foreign Secretary noted that:

“Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh’s remarks are very much similar to what I was just saying about the need for a clear and strong resolution in the United Nations’ Security Council. Clearly, we have failed so far. The process that Kofi Annan has launched has failed so far to bring about a peaceful political process and so now we need the Security Council to greatly strengthen the pressure for that to happen.

“If the Annan plan was implemented, it is a solution, because it would bring about a cessation of violence and that’s what the Assad regime said they would do right back on 12 April. And we agreed in our Geneva action group meeting, which included all the five permanent members of the Security Council on 13 June, that we would support a transitional government in Syria, including members of the present government and of the opposition on the basis of mutual consent to see a peaceful solution.

“But of course the situation is deteriorating so gravely that we do have to do other things. In the United Kingdom, for instance, we have continued to increase our support to the opposition and to apply more sanctions to Syria with or without a United Nations resolution. The situation is so grave and so unpredictable that I don’t think any option should be ruled out in the future”.",Doubling humanitarian funding to £17.5 million,Welfare,,id25_78

Exercise Watermark will bring together government bodies, big business, and local communities to trial responses to a range of scenarios which could occur during a flood emergency.

Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman used a visit to the Flood Forecasting Centre in Farringdon today to announce plans for the exercise.

Mrs. Spelman said:

“Climate change means that flooding will be unavoidable in the future so we must take steps now to analyse the risk and plan ahead. The Flood Forecasting Centre is vital in providing the evidence, but we must ensure that we act on it.

“Exercise Watermark will be a real test of our ability to deal with a range of flooding issues such as burst riverbanks, surface water flooding and reservoir failure. This is just one example of the important work that Defra and its agencies are doing to help local communities improve their resilience in a ‘big society’ approach to flooding.”

Beginning with a pilot event in November 2010, Exercise Watermark will then go live across England and Wales from 4-11 March 2011. More than 3,500 emergency responders and numerous community groups have already signed up to the country’s largest national multi-agency flooding exercise.

Organisations that will be taking part include 31 Local Resilience Forums, hospitals, the Ministry of Defence, Network Rail and the Flood Forecasting Centre. Companies including EDF Energy and the Bank of England have all signed up to test their business continuity arrangements as part of the exercise.

Lord Chris Smith, Environment Agency Chairman, said:

“Exercise Watermark will test all aspects of severe flooding across England and Wales, making it one of the biggest ever emergency exercises. The effects of flooding can be devastating so it is essential that we are all prepared to deal with flood risk.

“We are encouraged by the number and range of people and organisations that are already taking part, including businesses and community groups, and would urge others to sign up by visitingwww.exercisewatermark.co.uk.”

In addition to the central national exercise, local exercises and activities will take place simultaneously all over England and Wales, involving local people, schools and other community groups. For example, an area of Sutton-on-Sea will be evacuated with evacuees being transported to a processing centre for an overnight stay before returning to their homes.

Welsh Assembly Government Environment Minister, Jane Davidson said:

“Flooding and coastal erosion are two of the most visible consequences of the changes that our climate is experiencing.  In the coming years we will see rising sea levels, increases in the intensity and amount of rainfall and, inevitably, more frequent flooding.

“In Wales we are currently consulting on a national strategy to reduce the risks we face and the consequences of flooding and coastal erosion.  However, exercises like Watermark provide vital experience for those involved in the emergency services to test their resilience during difficult times.”",Exercise Watermark,Administrative,Informational,id25_80

Commenting on the statement, Foreign Office Minister Jeremy Browne said:

“I am delighted that this statement has attracted such widespread support from a broad cross-regional group of countries. Over 80 countries have signed up to this statement - the highest ever number of signatories to a UN statement on LGBT issues.

The research, collected by YouGov, has indicated that over half (53%) feel more uncomfortable seeking help for loneliness; a higher proportion than any other concern listed.

The sample of more than 1,000 students highlighted that concerns about loneliness (52%) came ahead of other major concerns including managing money (49%), course difficulty (49%), finding suitable housing (26%) or even ‘fitting in’ (48%).

However, the research found there was little judgement from others towards those that admitted to feeling lonely. Almost nine in ten (87%) students disagreed they would judge someone who said they felt this way, while 60% said they would strike up a conversation with a friend if they mentioned feeling lonely.

This new research comes as the Government partners with international restaurant chain Wingstop.  A free campaign on the chain’s in-store digital screens and social media channels will encourage students to get together at meal times and direct them to the Better Health - Every Mind Matters website which has resources and support for loneliness and mental health issues.

The Government is also partnering with charity Sporting Wellness, as well as the Student Radio Association, Student Roost and Student Minds, to raise awareness of the campaign and its resources through their channels and university focused activities. This aims to make young people feel more comfortable talking about loneliness, addressing the stigma as well as pointing them to support.

The latest phase of the Government’sBetter Health - Every Mind Matterscampaign targeted young people. It encouraged those aged 16 to 34 to ‘lift someone out of loneliness’ by carrying out small acts of kindness such as starting a conversation or inviting someone out for a tea or coffee.

Minister for Loneliness, Stuart Andrew said:

As these findings make clear, loneliness can affect anyone at any time. While freshers’ week is an exciting time for many, it can often be a daunting prospect for students. Moving away from home and away from friends and family can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation, especially while trying to manage coursework, make new friends and often navigate a new city.

There are small things everyone can do to help alleviate loneliness and open up the conversation. This includes reaching out to those that might be struggling and spending time volunteering, such as by offering a regular conversation to someone feeling isolated.

We want everyone to feel comfortable talking about loneliness and to help them find the right advice and support whenever they need it.

The findings revealed that eight in ten (82%) said they had supported or would support a friend feeling lonely, most often by just starting a conversation and offering reassurance, showing that the issue is far more normal than many perceive.

When it comes to tackling the issue, research also found that joining a society or club was the most helpful intervention, with nearly half (42%) of those who did this as a result of feeling lonely saying it was the most helpful action they took.

Research also found that the experience of loneliness at university differs for female students and disabled students, with more than half (58%) of female students saying they don’t feel comfortable getting help for loneliness compared to nearly half (48%) of male students. Similarly, 61% of disabled students say they wouldn’t feel comfortable getting help for loneliness, compared to 51% non-disabled students.

Findings differ for those who identify as LGB+, with almost half (47%) saying they felt isolated from their peers compared to a third (34%) of heterosexual students. While nearly half (48%) of heterosexual students were concerned about feeling lonely before starting their course, the figure jumps to 62% for LGB+ students.

Minister for Skills, Apprenticeships and Higher Education Robert Halfon said:

Starting university is an exciting time for many young people but the new environment and expectations can be challenging.

As this research shows, meeting new people and making friends is a top concern for students starting university, but I hope that they can see that they are not alone in this. Not only is this a common feeling for people at any age, but their fellow students are supportive and understanding.

We have asked the Office for Students to allocate £15 million on a range of mental health support, including for students’ transition to university. If students are struggling, I would encourage them to visit Student Space, which has already supported over 450,000 students with free resources and support on mental health and issues like loneliness.

Lauryn Davey, Medical Student, Youth Ambassador at Sporting Wellness said:

Starting university can be such a big step, as many of us are surrounded by new people in new environments. It’s so important to talk about loneliness with those around you and to recognise those feelings as completely normal. For me, joining a sports club was so helpful for my mental wellbeing, physical health and it helped me meet some of my closest friends.

Jenny Smith, Policy Manager at Student Minds, the UK’s student mental health charity, said:

This evidence shows that while loneliness is a common concern in our university communities, there’s a lot of sympathy and understanding among students.

Anybody struggling can look at these figures and know what they’re going through isn’t unusual or uncommon. Of course, this doesn’t mean that any student should have to suffer in silence.

Loneliness can be detrimental to mental wellbeing and university experience, so it’s crucial that students are empowered to address loneliness and form connections.

We’re pleased to see the government is raising this issue, and want people to know that help is available.Student Spaceis here to help you with the uncertainties of student life with a range of resources available to support students dealing with loneliness and worries about making friends.

Mark Rowland, Chief Executive at Mental Health Foundation, said:

We know that some groups of people, including young people aged 16-24, are more at risk of loneliness so it’s important that we do more to understand their experiences and provide the right support.

An important step is to address stigma about who experiences loneliness so that young people don’t feel ashamed about how they feel. Being able to have open conversations is vital but the stigma of loneliness can make it hard to talk about, as we worry about being judged or feeling like a burden.

Starting college or university is an exciting but nerve-wracking time so we encourage new students to access ourBehind the Booksresources for expert tips and advice. We welcome any government support for student wellbeing that helps prevent poor mental health.

Since launching the world’s first government strategy on loneliness, the Government and its partners have invested over £80 million in tackling loneliness. This includes up to £30 million allocated via the Know Your Neighbourhood Fund’ creating volunteering opportunities and helping reduce loneliness in 27 disadvantaged areas.

Practical tips for students dealing with feelings of loneliness include:

This fast-moving, innovative technology applies engineering principles to the design of biological systems and processes. It can create practical solutions to some of society’s biggest challenges, addressing issues faced by people and the planet, both now and in the future.

The report, published by the Government Office for Science, examines how we can harness EngBio to create a more sustainable future, helping to solve problems in areas such as healthcare, environmental sustainability, agriculture and energy.

Read theEngineering Biology Aspirations report.

Science Minister Lord Vallance said:

This is a timely report. Engineering biology is a technology with enormous potential, and it is already delivering innovations from healthcare to clean energy, supporting the missions that underpin this Government’s Plan for Change.

Our commitment to the UK’s burgeoning engineering biology sector is clear: from £100 million investment in the Engineering Biology Mission Hubs and Awards, to efforts to improve the regulation of this critical technology, including through the new Regulatory Innovation Office.

Commenting on the report, Government Chief Scientific Adviser, Professor Dame Angela McLean said:

Engineering biology has the power to drive economic growth and deliver transformative solutions to a wide range of challenges.

This report aims be a source of inspiration across Government, industry, academia and the public, demonstrating what might be possible if we can harness the opportunities offered by engineering biology.

The paper features expert-authored chapters that consider how EngBio can aid efforts to solve global challenges. One examines the revolutionary solutions that lab-grown blood could present. Another explores how biologically derived fashion materials could reduce environmental pollution to create a more sustainable industry. Further chapters include how nitrogen-fixing cereals could produce a new sustainable generation of crops, and how microbes can help solve metal scarcity and be manufactured to create sustainable fuels and chemicals from waste.

As the report highlights, although there is still progress to be made, with continued research, development, scale-up, and regulatory considerations, EngBio can help to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time.

The “Engineering Biology Aspirations” report is a result of cross-Government work and collaboration with leading scientists to understand this transformative technology and its vast applications.

The hallmark of the Government’s new approach is the engagement of the whole of the UK Government in support of the Territories, based on an agreement to the Foreign Secretary’s proposals by the Prime Minister chaired National Security Council.

Speaking at the conference, the Foreign Secretary William Hague reiterated the UK’s commitment to continue this increased engagement:

“My Ministerial team in the FCO and my colleagues across other Government departments will work tirelessly to ensure that our partnership promotes the best interest of all our citizens and a bright and successful future for the Overseas Territories.”

Discussions at the OTCC focused on the forthcoming White Paper, as well as stimulating economic growth, strengthening the OTs’ highly successful international financial centres, taxation policy, education and social issues, climate change, food security and the environment. Sessions also covered good governance, financial management and economic planning, with Ministers from the Departments for International Development, Ministry of Defence, Treasury and Transport attending on the first day.

In a sign of the renewed cross Government support for the new strategy, a further eight Departments attended the second day, with UK Government Ministers and senior officials participating from the Departments of Education; Communities and Local Government; Culture, Media and Sport; Home Office; Business, Innovation and Skills; Work and Pensions; Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; and Energy, and Climate Change.

At the close of the conference, Minister for the Overseas Territories, Henry Bellingham said:

“This Government has a clear vision for our Overseas Territories to be vibrant and flourishing communities, proudly retaining aspects of their British identity and generating wider opportunities for their people. I had bilateral meetings with the Territory leaders on Tuesday and chaired my second Overseas Territories Consultative Council on Wednesday and Thursday. I was pleased to welcome over 250 guests to a reception that I hosted in honour of Territory leaders. Our discussions at the Consultative Council have been wide-ranging and constructive. I was struck by the exceptional enthusiasm for our new partnership from Territory and UK participants. There is a huge interest in our OTs, including in their fantastic environmental resources. The Government’s policy is awakening interest in this little known but very valuable aspect of Britain.

We discussed global economic challenges and how the UK and Territories are taking action to strengthen public financial management and diversify economic development. We also discussed with Territory leaders ways in which we can build a stronger partnership, including by enabling the Territories to access UK public sector expertise and training - especially through secondments; and by strengthening links and engagement with the Commonwealth and EU.

I am glad that nine of my Ministerial colleagues from across Government were able to attend the Consultative Council this week, a clear demonstration that the UK Government as a whole is supporting the Territories, and not just the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Department for International Development. We will continue to work closely with the Territories as we prepare for the publication of our White Paper on the Territories next year.”",Engagement of the whole of the UK Government in support of the Territories,Institutional,Other,id25_89

A new Animal Health and Welfare Board for England will bring experts including farmers, veterinarians, welfare experts and others from outside Government together with the Chief Veterinary Officer and civil servants to make direct policy recommendations on policy affecting the health and welfare of all kept animals such as farm animals, horses and pets.

Jim Paice said:

“This is a completely new way of working.  It replaces the old ways, where the people most affected by decisions were kept at arm’s length from policy making on those subjects.

“This is about the Big Society not just existing in our communities, but in the heart of Government - helping to put the decisions in the hands of those who are doing the work on the ground.

“We’ve already seen the success of a partnership between farmers and the Government with the work that’s been done on bluetongue - which has seen the disease virtually eradicated in this country.”

Final decisions on animal health and welfare policy will remain in the hands of Government Ministers.

The Board will be made up of around 12 members, 5 senior Defra officials including the Chief Veterinary Officer, and 7-8 external members including the chair.  The external members will have experience and knowledge of kept and farmed animals, animal and veterinary science, and animal welfare, and could be farmers, veterinarians, animal welfare experts.

The Board and its members will have to represent the views of all stakeholders so will be expected to communicate with them regularly.

The Board’s responsibilities include:

The Board will not be set up as a non departmental public body or arms length body.  It will form part of the internal structure of Defra.

On 13 December the Independent Responsibility and Cost Sharing Advisory Group chaired by Rosemary Radcliffe published the findings of their work on how animal keepers can play a greater role on tackling animal disease.

The Terms of Reference for the Board can be found atwww.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/animals/diseases/sharing/. The Written Ministerial Statement can be found below.

We plan to have the Board in place by the second half of 2011.  Details of how people can apply to become members of the board can be found at.http://publicappts.defra.gov.uk/.  Adverts will appear from 26th April.

The independent Responsibility and Cost Sharing Advisory group report can be found athttp://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/policy/animalhealth/sharing/pdf/rcsag-report101213.pdf.

The external members of the Board will be appointed on merit through a transparent process and will serve in an individual capacity and to jointly make decisions and provide advice.

The Board will have to communicate with industry to ensure all stakeholders are considered in the Board’s decision-making process.

The Board will not be responsible for animal experimentation, or the welfare of circus and zoo animals other than where a disease risk is present.

Since the Foot and Mouth disease outbreak in 2001 the Government has worked more and more closely with farming and veterinary industry in tackling disease outbreaks.  For example, the close partnership working between Government and industry was key in successfully addressing the outbreaks of bluetongue virus (BTV) in GB. Our recent surveillance has confirmed that we have now had 2 years without circulating BTV in GB, and we hope to be able to move towards official BTV8 free status in the near future.

Animal health and welfare is a devolved policy, and the Board covers England only.  The Government recently devolved the animal health and welfare budget for England, Scotland and Waleswww.defra.gov.uk/news/2011/03/14/ahw-budgets/.

I am pleased to announce that the government is setting up a new Animal Health and Welfare Board for England. This is an important step in sharing responsibility for animal health and welfare with animal keepers and other interested parties. The aim is to build trust between government and animal keepers and strengthen arrangements for working together to develop a true partnership.

Animal diseases, whether outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, avian influenza, or bluetongue, or current ones such as bovine TB, or salmonella, can be costly to animal keepers and government alike. It is in everyone’s interests to reduce the risk and costs of disease outbreaks relating to all kept animals, including farmed animals, horses and pets, and to maintain our reputation for high welfare standards.

Since the 2001 foot and mouth disease outbreak, industry and government have worked more closely together to agree disease control strategies, and there has been a series of proposals and consultations about what respective responsibilities should be in future. Most recently the report of the independently chaired Advisory Group on responsibility and cost sharing was published on 13 December 2010. I record here my thanks to the Chair and all the members of the Advisory Group for their work.

In developing our proposals for the Board we have carefully considered the Group’s recommendations, and listened to the views expressed about them since the report’s publication.

The new Board will have responsibility for strategic animal health and welfare policy and oversight of its delivery in relation to England. It will be composed of around 12 members, who will be the senior Defra officials with responsibility for animal health and welfare (currently 5 people including the Chief Veterinary Officer in his England role) and around 7-8 external non-executive members. The Board will be the principal source of departmental advice to Defra Ministers on strategic animal health and welfare policy in relation to England.

We will seek external members (including the Chair) who between them, have the skills, knowledge and experience to understand the whole range of strategic policy matters. We are looking for individuals who have the trust and respect of animal keepers and all other stakeholders.

Each external member of the Board will have responsibility for engaging with a set of stakeholder groups and ensuring that the views of those groups are articulated in the Board’s decision-making processes. We will consult the NFU and other stakeholder groups on the best way to organise this to ensure effective two-way communication.

The external members of the Board will serve in an individual capacity. Members will be appointed on merit in a transparent process. I will advertise the posts publicly and invite organisations to encourage suitable candidates, who can demonstrate the confidence and trust of stakeholders and their representative organisations, to put themselves forward.

I expect the Board to be appointed in the second half of 2011, and its views will shape the way Defra does business in the future and how it manages key relationships with delivery bodies, particularly the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency.

This is an innovative and exciting approach to bringing those affected by government decisions into the heart of the process in order to create a more direct link between those making Defra policy and those experiencing the delivery of that policy. Its success will depend on the support of animal keepers and stakeholder organisations for the Board and its members. I look forward to continuing the constructive dialogue already evident in the responses to the Advisory Group report.

The Board will not deliver results overnight. This is a new way of working for both government and stakeholders. I expect it gradually to strengthen joint working and lead to a greater understanding by all of the practices that collectively and cost effectively reduce disease risk and maintain high welfare. Agreement on how best to achieve them should lead to greater adherence to responsible practices and thence to reduced animal disease risk and improved standards of health and welfare. This will benefit government, the public and animal keepers.

The Advisory Group recommended that cost sharing should be taken forward in a staged approach once responsibility sharing arrangements were in place. Once established I will look to the Board for advice on funding arrangements as it develops animal health and welfare policy for the future.

He converted the British television format Pop Idol into Cricket Idol for the Indian market, which was very successful. Watch his short film below.



Manoj believes the UK is a perfect place to launch a business, and that the UK’s values of tolerance and equality helped him to seize opportunities and establish himself. In the film, Manoj identifies Britain’s status as one of the world’s leading financial centres as an asset to those who are looking to start their own business here. With access to a range of opportunities, and a wealth of talent from some of the best educational institutions in the world, Britain offers rising entrepreneurs an open and connected location in which to build their business.

The new Government £20 million business training scheme will bring new skills and business knowledge to rural areas, helping them take up new opportunities in the home and export markets.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said:

Having the right skills to run a business is crucial if budding entrepreneurs want to be successful. For too long the needs of rural business people have been overlooked. Those days are now over. Businesses in the remotest parts of the country will now have access to the best training so they can grow and help our country to compete even more in the global race.

Defra will meet 70 per cent of training costs through its Rural Development Programme for England with the remaining 30 per cent met by individuals or their employers.

Subsidised courses in subjects including business and management, market opportunities and information technology will be open to businesses and individuals. They will range from one-day workshops to industry-recognised qualifications and will be run on college campuses, in village halls, on farms and in business centres. The organisations providing the training will be able to tailor the courses to meet demand.

Mr Paterson is making the announcement on a fact-finding Rural Roadshow to Herefordshire. He will visit Herefordshire College of Technology, one of many colleges offering training in horticultural, agricultural and forestry skills as part of the scheme.

Rural Roadshows allow ministers to hear first-hand from rural communities and businesses what more the Government can do to support economic growth and help their communities to thrive.

The message came at the launch of a new interactive online tool designed by Defra and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) to prepare businesses for both climate risks and opportunities.

The Climate Resilience Toolkit is a quick and simple online tool available on the Business Link website for businesses wanting to increase their resilience to the changing climate, or explore possibilities for growth by taking advantage of the opportunities climate change will bring.

The toolkit provides a tailored report for each business to help it focus on what it should be doing to prepare, such as checking the robustness of its supply chain, the threat of flooding to premises and possible changes in customer demand for products.

Environment Minister Lord Henley said:

“Climate change will have impacts on all UK businesses, such as the availability of resources, demand for different products, and the increased threat of floods, drought and other extreme weather. But smart businesses that take action now to limit the risks and identify the opportunities climate change could bring will steal a march on their rivals.

“The Climate Resilience Toolkit we have developed with CIMA is an excellent tool for quickly and simply assessing areas in your business that could be affected by climate change.”

While many organisations have looked at reducing their carbon emissions, few have seriously considered how to address the impacts of an already changing climate. A survey commissioned by Defra last year found that two thirds of the UK’s largest businesses (68%) have not yet acted on the risks and opportunities that climate change poses. Businesses must not only consider how to reduce their environmental impact, but also how to adapt and build resilience to the expected impacts of climate change as part of their wider business model.

Andrew Harding, Executive Director, CIMA Markets, explains:

“Forward-thinking businesses must be aware of the risks and alive to the opportunities that climate change brings.  Many SMEs fail to prepare for climate change, leaving it to the big players in industry to manage and mitigate those risks.  This can leave many SMEs in a vulnerable position.   It is vital that all businesses, whatever their size, assess these risks now and take action to manage those risks to avoid costly disruption.  This online tool will improve organisations’ risk planning around climate change and will help them become more economically resilient.

“Sustainability makes good business sense and it should be embedded at the very heart of any company strategy.  As companies incorporate these environmental considerations into their strategies for long-term business success, management accountants have an important role to play in ensuring that investments in sustainability capabilities produce greater returns than simply meeting compliance requirements.”

Andrew Slight, Head of External Affairs at PepsiCo UK & Ireland, said:

“PepsiCo is reducing carbon emissions in our own operations as well as throughout our supply chain.  But we also know that tackling climate change is about adaptation as well as mitigation.  For example, we are working with Climate East, Defra, Suffolk Country Council, Anglian Water and the Environment Agency to understand how climate change will affect the water availability for our Copella apple juice plant at Boxford in Suffolk and for the local community. By asking these questions now, we want to ensure the long term resilience and viability of our operations, and work with others towards having a positive water impact.

“The new toolkit will help businesses gain a better understanding of the risks and opportunities involved in adapting to a changing climate and, we hope, lead to more collaboration between business, Government, water companies and other stakeholders which will help us all manage future risks better.”",Climate Resilience Toolkit,Informational,Other,id25_99

Summer holidays are the peak time for young people to be taken overseas and forced into a marriage against their will. In some cases they are taken on what they have been told is a holiday to visit family abroad, but in fact a marriage has been planned. Once abroad, victims are often even more isolated than they might have been in the UK and getting help is more difficult.

To raise awareness of the risks and the help available in the run-up to the summer holidays, three hard-hitting films have been developed. They remind young people to speak up if they think they or someone they are close to are in danger.

Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt said:

“Forced marriage should not be tolerated. Young people have the right to choose whether to marry, who to marry, and when. Anybody worried that they or a friend are at risk of being forced into marriage abroad should seek advice before it’s too late. There may be only one chance to save yourself or someone else from a life they did not choose.”

Many young people feel scared to ask for help or take action about their concerns. The new Right to Choose campaign aims to stress that while it might be difficult to admit that you’re at risk, forced marriage can and does happen and doing nothing is not the answer.  The FMU wants young people and professionals working with them to speak out about forced marriage, and seek advice and help before potential victims are taken abroad.

Home Office Minister Lynne Featherstone said:

“Forcing someone into marriage is completely unacceptable, that is why the government is making it a crime.  Everyone should have the right to make their own choices about their relationships and their future.  But making it illegal is not enough on its own, so we are supporting work to protect victims.  The Right to Choose campaign is another vital part of this and will help raise awareness of the damage being forced into marriage can do.”

Joint Head of the Forced Marriage Unit Amy Cumming said:

“Every day in the unit we see the devastating impact forced marriage has on individuals.  Many of the victims who contact us have experienced horrendous sexual and physical violence. They endure intense pressure in many forms - whether emotional, financial or otherwise. Forced marriage affects many communities and cultures.  Today, I’m strongly urging people to back the Right to Choose campaign: don’t leave it too late - call our helpline and get advice.”",Right to Choose campaign,Informational,Other,id25_101

In August 2009, the previous government suspended the Turks and Caicos Islands ministerial government for an initial period of up to two years.  A Special Investigation and Prosecution Team was appointed to undertake a criminal investigation into matters identified by Sir Robin Auld’s report, which concluded that there was a high probability of systemic corruption in the former Turks and Caicos Islands Government. The Team is pursuing its work as rigorously and as quickly as possible.

On 1 July 2010, as an urgent initial response to the unfolding financial plight of the Turks and Caicos Islands Government, the Secretary of State for International Development stated that his department was having to step in to design and put in place a package of financial support with commercial lenders, as well as providing an immediate short term loan to help meet unavoidable commitments including staff salaries for the Islands’ police, health and education services.

It has become clear to UK Ministers that the fiscal picture in Turks and Caicos Islands represents an unacceptable collapse in the fiscal governance of the Territory, which needs urgently to be addressed. Whilst funding the immediate unavoidable costs of the Turks and Caicos Islands Government, the Department for International Development has provided a Chief Financial Officer to the Turks and Caicos Islands Government, to meet the urgent task of addressing its structural deficit and putting it on a course towards a sustainable fiscal surplus in the financial year 2012/13.  In addition, the Department is reaching the final stages of putting in place a medium term financial package.

In September 2010, I announced in the Turks and Caicos Islands that the UK Government did not want to postpone elections any longer than necessary, but that they could not be held in 2011. We intend to submit to the 15 December meeting of the Privy Council an Order in Council continuing in force the Turks and Caicos Islands Constitution (Interim Amendment) Order 2009 beyond 14 August 2011.

I undertook to set out milestones that would need to be met before elections could once again take place. The FCO and DFID currently jointly assess these milestones to be as follows:

Reaching these milestones will require time, care and hard work by the UK and the Turks and Caicos Islands Government, and particularly by the Turks and Caicos Islands Public Sector.  It will need the encouragement of the community.  There will be public consultation on a number of issues across Turks and Caicos Islands and, we hope, the engagement of the Islands’ political parties.  The milestones we have identified do not include everything that will have to be done before elections take place. In general the UK Government will have to be satisfied that the necessary reforms have been put in place to address the issues raised by the Commission of Inquiry, to prevent such maladministration being repeated, and to engender the confidence of the international community.  It is our considered view at this stage, that the milestones listed above are the minimum preconditions before the Turks and Caicos Islands can return to elected government.

The UK Government has helped protect the Turks and Caicos Islands Government finances from complete collapse and intends to provide continuing financial support.  However it is important that the Islands make good use of this period of UK financial support to address the deep crisis in public finance and to achieve a fiscal surplus. The UK Government currently intends to retain sufficient control over public finances following elections in order to ensure that the Turks and Caicos Islands Government emerges from its financial crisis as soon as possible, and that the temporary package of UK support is no longer needed.

We hope achievement of these milestones will also help any future Turks and Caicos Islands Government to continue to embed good governance, with full respect for the rule of law and human rights, and zero tolerance of corruption.

Achieving these milestones will be a great challenge.  As we now see things, the UK Government will only be able to set a date for the elections when the milestones have been reached.  We hope that this will happen in time for elections to take place in 2012.","Provision of financial support to the Turks and Caicos Islands Government, including a short-term loan and ongoing financial package.",Welfare,,id25_102

“It is a great pleasure to welcome Franco Frattini to the United Kingdom today and to host him here in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

Italy is our close friend in Europe, a robust and like-minded partner in foreign and security policy, and one of our oldest allies anywhere in the world. This year marks 150 years since the Unification of Italy, and we are proud that Britain was the first country in the world to recognise a modern, unified Italy. Our relations have gone from strength to strength since then.

Much of our discussion today concerned events in the Middle East and North Africa. This is a historic moment of opportunity for the region to achieve greater political and economic freedom, and for human rights to be advanced. We discussed the need to transform the European Union’s neighbourhood policy, so that it becomes a truly bold and visionary programme capable of encouraging such positive change and responding to the aspirations of people in the region. This should be one of the very top priorities of European external affairs over the coming months. We must seize every opportunity to support democratic change and to stand up for our values in a way that goes beyond words to action and long term assistance.

We agreed that the situation in Syria is deeply troubling, and that violence against protestors is unacceptable. I call again on the Syrian government to respect the right to free speech and to peaceful protest, and to put in train the meaningful political reform which is the only legitimate response to demands from the Syrian people.

We discussed the need for a political transition in Yemen to begin immediately; we agreed to continue to work closely on international pressure and engagement over Iran’s nuclear programme, and we spoke of the need for urgent progress on the Middle East Peace Process.

Today British and Italian military forces and diplomats are working side by side with our allies to protect the lives of civilians in Libya and to support a peaceful and democratic future for that country. I want to put on record our gratitude to the government of Italy for its strong military and political support to the international coalition, and for its assistance with military bases including for our Royal Air Force aircraft.

The action we are taking in Libya is necessary, it is legal, it is the right thing to do and it has saved many lives already. We should never forget that this crisis was precipitated entirely by a regime that turned its guns, and the full weight of oppression on peaceful and unarmed protestors, and that in doing so has lost all legitimacy in the eyes of the world. It is our position and that of our allies that Colonel Qadhafi must go. I met Libya’s former Ambassador to the United Nations Mr Shalqam this morning. He agreed with me that there can be no peaceful future for Libya that involves Colonel Qadhafi, and that he must leave power.

There has been no change to the conditions that the Qadhafi regime must meet since they were set out by President Obama and by our Prime Minister and others. That means an end to all attacks and abuses against civilians. That means a genuine and real ceasefire, the withdrawal of regime forces from cities and the full flow of humanitarian assistance to the people of Libya. There should be no ceasefire that does not meet the conditions of UNSC Resolutions 1970 and 1973 in full, and that is not acceptable to those representing the opposition in Libya, including the Interim National Council. Anything short of this would be a betrayal of the people of Libya and would play into the hands of the regime, which has announced two utterly meaningless ceasefires since the fighting began, without its vicious military campaign skipping a single beat. And we will therefore continue to judge the regime by its actions and not its words.

Franco and I will both be in Qatar this week for the first meeting of the Contact Group on Libya that was established at the London Conference.

We hope this meeting will build on the success of that Conference. We go to Qatar to maintain the international pressure on the Qadhafi regime, to reaffirm the strength and determination of the broad international coalition, and to make further progress in planning for vital humanitarian and stabilisation support, and long term political support. The Interim National Council, which will be present at part of that meeting, will be able to set out more of their thinking about a political process that achieves a free and democratic future for the people of Libya. It’s a process that has to be owned and led by the people of Libya themselves, and they will have our full support as they do so.

I am delighted that Italy has announced that it will host the next meeting of the Contact Group.”",International Pressure and Engagement over Iran’s Nuclear Programme,Other,,id25_103

“I am deeply concerned by the recent violence in the Abbasiya district of Cairo and resulting loss of life. I call on all those involved to show maximum restraint in order to avoid further bloodshed. The right to peaceful freedom of expression and assembly is integral to Egypt’s transition to democracy, and it is crucial at this stage of the Presidential election process that  it is not threatened by the return of such violence.

“Such unrest reinforces the need to make progress on the transition to civilian rule, through a transparent and inclusive process which allows all voices to be heard, to the timetable already agreed by the Egyptian authorities.

“The British Government has made clear that the outcome of the transition is for the Egyptian people to decide. But to meet their aspirations it should lead to a legitimate and democratic government, underpinned by strong state institutions which are accountable to the people, and a constitution that guarantees and protects the rights of all Egyptians. A free press and vibrant civil society remain crucial elements of this transition.”",Call on all those involved to show maximum restraint,Other,,id25_104

“Well this meeting is at a very important time of course in the development of European policy towards the Middle East and North Africa. The United Kingdom believes that it’s very important for our policies to be bold and ambitious, for Europe to be a magnet for positive change, for the countries on our, in our Southern neighbourhood and we want to discuss more of the detail of that today.

The events in the Middle East are the most important events so far in the Twenty First Century in the, in the world. And it is very important that the response of Europe is commensurate with the scale and historic nature of those events.

Today I’m also looking forward to briefing my colleagues on the arrangements for the Contact Group meeting on Libya in Doha tomorrow.  I hope that Contact Group meeting will show a further strengthening of the international coalition on Libya.  We of course will also look at further humanitarian aid that can be given to the people of Libya and I believe we will also be very clear that any viable future for Libya involves the departure of Colonel Gaddafi.

Also today it is important to note that we have agreed sanctions, restrictive measures on Iran because of the appalling human rights record of Iran. Iran seems to have believed that with all the change happening in the Middle East that they can get away with an even worse human rights situation in their country: the imprisonment of opposition leaders, the detention of more journalists than any other country in the world, the excessive use of the death penalty, often on vague charges.  And the European Union is agreeing today restrictive measures on thirty two individuals in Iran we believe are responsible and instrumental in those policies.

We’re also agreeing on the renewal of a strong sanctions regime on Burma, another country which has an appalling human rights record and I’m pleased that the European Union has fully recognised that in our deliberations as well.”

Electricity bills to be cut for thousands living near new pylons, as the government moves forward with plans to get Britain building and put communities at the heart of a cleaner, more affordable, homegrown energy system.

Those living near new pylons across Great Britain are set to receive up to £2,500 off their bills over 10 years, as the government tomorrow (Friday 8 August) launches aconsultation on proposals included in the Planning and Infrastructure Bill. The plans could see eligible households save up to £250 off their electricity bill a year, receiving a £125 discount every 6 months.

This delivers on the government’s commitment to get Britain building again, under its Plan for Change, while ensuring those supporting Britain’s clean energy mission receive direct, meaningful benefits.

Around twice as much new transmission network infrastructure will be needed by 2030 as has been built in the past decade, with the government’s new planning reforms –announced earlier this year– aiming to remove barriers and back the builders.

Rural communities across Great Britain could benefit most of all from the bill discounts as government speeds up vital upgrades to the nation’s outdated electricity network. Building a clean, homegrown, affordable energy system that Britain controls will protect billpayers from global fossil fuel price spikes and unlock economic growth and investment.

Minister for Energy Consumers Miatta Fahnbulleh said:

As we build the infrastructure we need to deliver homegrown, affordable energy, communities must be given a stake.

That is why we are teaming up with communities hosting new pylons to ensure they receive direct, tangible benefits.

We are on the side of those who want Britain to get back to what it does best: building for the future, driving innovation and putting communities first.

This comes alongside confirmation millions of households will be supported to take control of their energy usage and bring down their bills under new plans to transform the consumer smart meter experience.

Tough new obligations will be placed on energy suppliers to improve every stage of the smart meter process, under plans being put forward tomorrow. The reforms, set to be introduced next year, include new and improved compensation for long installation and repair wait times.

The proposals set out by Ofgem include requirements to cut waiting times for installation appointments and fix meters that have stopped working in smart mode within 90 days – or provide consumers with automatic compensation.

Anew guide to smart meteringwill support families to gain a better understanding of their rights, by clearly setting out in one place everything households can expect from suppliers when they get a smart meter. This will be developed into a new Consumer Charter for smart metering in due course.

This is in addition to connectivity improvements across Scotland and the north of England, including the roll out of 4G cellular communication services, which will enable millions of households to feel the benefits of getting a smart meter installed.

Charlotte Friel, Director of Retail Pricing and Systems at Ofgem, said:

Millions of consumers rely on their smart meter every day for accurate billing, cheaper tariffs, automatic meter readings and real-time data to help keep track of spending.

But we know many customers that want a smart meter wait too long to get one installed or face delays on repairs when it stops working – this needs to change.

We’re working closely with suppliers to drive improvement, and have seen more than 600,000 faulty smart meters reconnected since last July after we opened compliance engagement. This is only the beginning – with automatic compensation, faster fixes, and improved installation standards well on the way, getting a smart meter will be quicker and easier than ever.

These new rules are about setting clear expectations of suppliers, incentivising them to boost smart meter standards, and protecting consumers from poor service if things go wrong.

The measures set out will help households across the country enjoy lower bills through better management of their energy usage and access to more flexible tariffs, ensuring consumers are put first as suppliers work to install smart meters in all remaining homes by the end of 2030.

This marks an important step towards repairing the energy retail market, building on the government’s plans set out earlier this year to make sure that energy consumers can access redress more fairly, quickly and easily when things go wrong.

The consultation, launching tomorrow, on direct and meaningful benefits for communities who live close to new transmission infrastructure also marks a key step in delivering on the government’s clean energy mission.

A recent study found that 77% said that new electricity network infrastructure in Great Britain would be acceptable, but acceptability dropped to 61% for infrastructure in respondents’ local area. The government is putting consumers at the heart of plans to rewire Britain’s outdated transmission network – ensuring those living near these works see money off their bills in return.

Dhara Vyas, Chief Executive Officer of Energy UK, said:

Much of the country’s energy infrastructure was built several decades ago and designed for a system very different from the one we have today - or the one we need in the future. Expanding and upgrading the delivery of energy to homes and businesses is long overdue and urgently needed.

Clean power will drive economic growth across the UK, and ensuring we get the maximum benefit from our own sources of clean energy is the best way to deliver stable, affordable bills and to increase Great Britain’s energy security.

Some areas and some customers will of course be particularly and physically affected by these efforts and the energy industry will continue to work with these communities to ensure that they can reap the benefits of these investments.

The introduction of a new approach to community benefits is welcome and marks a significant step in turning the proposals in the Planning and Infrastructure Bill into reality, helping to address the cost-of-living crisis and ensuring local communities that host clean power infrastructure feel an immediate and tangible benefit.

New networks are vital to a clean power system, helping to deliver a cost-effective, secure, and economically sustainable system for the future.

Dan Brooke, Chief Executive of Smart Energy GB, said:

Progress has been made in improving the smart meter customer experience, with 9 in 10 smart meters now operating in smart mode and the latest data from Citizens Advice and Ofgem showing that people’s satisfaction with smart meters has increased over the last 18 months. The latest data also shows that the vast majority of people are happy with their smart meter.

It’s important that people have a positive experience of smart meters, whether they’re already an owner or looking to get one installed. The range of technical reforms outlined by government today – including expanding 4G services and allowing people to securely connect to the smart meter network using their broadband – will improve smart meter performance and mean more homes can have one installed.

These technical improvements, along with the government’s new guide to smart metering, will provide reassurance to households and allow an even greater number to enjoy the benefits that smart meters bring, including more control over energy use and access to flexible tariffs that can help save money.

Chris Lovatt, Chief Executive Officer of Data Communications Company, said:

Working closely with our customers and the Department for Energy, Security and Net Zero we are proud to have designed and delivered the next generation of communication hubs, leveraging 4G technology and available nationwide. Early installations show a step change in performance and offer significant per meter saving compared to legacy technology.

We are committed to playing our part, upgrading our connectivity services and operational support to deliver the best and most cost-effective smart metering experience for our customers.

Underproposals set out in the government’s Planning and Infrastructure Bill earlier this year, households within 500 metres of new or upgraded electricity transmission infrastructure could receive a discount of up to £250 via their electricity bill every year for 10 years.

The discounts, which would be assigned to the home and apply to the occupant, could be provided every 6 months and continue for up to 10 years, adding up to £2500.

Ensuring communities see real benefits from new infrastructure plans can help to reduce opposition and planning delays, unleashing thousands of new skilled job opportunities and local growth while securing Britain’s clean energy system.

The consultation on Scheme Design for Bill Discount Scheme for New Network Transmission Infrastructure will open tomorrow and will run for 7 weeks.

The government will tomorrow also confirm it will expand the scope of guidance on how communities should be recognised for hosting transmission infrastructure, by funding projects like sports clubs, educational programmes and leisure facilities. Guidance will include capacity upgrades for existing projects, where poles are replaced with steel lattice pylons, and that are screened for having an Environmental Impact Assessment. This will see immediate benefits for the Isle of Skye community, who will be eligible for millions in funding for local facilities as part of a transmission upgrade project on the Island – with more areas able to benefit from similar projects across Scotland in the future.

Thecommunity funds guidancewas published earlier this year and will be updated by the end of 2025.

The government will tomorrow publish:

The energy regulator Ofgem will also consult on proposals to require suppliers to compensate consumers for a range of issues related to smart metering.  These include cases where installation appointments are not offered within 6 weeks of a request, where an installation fails due to suppliers’ actions, and where customers do not get a response within 5 days of reporting an issue with their smart meter.",Direct discounts to households near new pylons,Welfare,,id25_110

Planting trees on and around riverbanks, or allowing them to grow naturally, can help to improve water quality by blocking the runoff of pollutants into rivers, manage flood risks by slowing the flow of water, boost biodiversity by creating new habitat corridors and make our rivers more climate resilient by providing shade and cooling water temperatures.

There are 242,262km of watercourses in England, and it is hoped that by planting trees in this way they will contribute to a natural network of habitats across the country as part of our plans to expand, improve and connect these places across our towns, cities and countryside.

The Woodlands For Water project aims to create 3,150 hectares of trees in six river catchment areas from Devon to Cumbria by March 2025. To support farmers and landowners to create these woodlands, they will be able to apply for funding through theEngland Woodland Creation Offergrant which provides greater financial incentives for landowners and farmers to plant and manage trees, including along rivers and watercourses.

This is a hugely exciting and untapped area for woodland creation. The benefits of planting trees by rivers are vast - from helping biodiversity recover by creating more natural riverbanks; to slowing the flow of surface water to reduce the risk of flooding; and improving water quality by buffering rivers from harmful agricultural pollution.

The Government is committed to trebling tree-planting rates by the end of this parliament, and in this vitally important year for tackling climate change with the Glasgow COP summit, this partnership marks an important next step in our plans to build back greener.

I am delighted to be working with partners to launch the Woodlands For Water project and deliver another major part of the England Trees Action Plan.

By putting the right trees in the right place, helped by our new England Woodland Creation Offer, the Woodlands For Water project can offer numerous benefits, from creating new woodland habitats; protecting existing habitats such as chalk streams; improving environments for fish by reducing water temperature, and helping rivers adapt to climate change.

Supported by Defra, the project will be carried out by the ‘Riverscapes’ Partnership comprising of experts from the Rivers Trust, National Trust, Woodland Trust and Beaver Trust, which will be on hand to provide expert assistance in the selected river catchment areas across England, ensuring there is pipeline of projects for riparian planting in future years.

The Riverscapes Partnership brings together leading national organisations who want to revive our rivers, restore nature and increase our resilience to droughts and floods.

Woodlands for Water is a very exciting first project for the partnership to work with Defra to meet the government’s targets on tree planting and its commitment to leave the environment in a better state for the next generation.

By planting the right trees in the right places, we can tackle multiple problems and provide multiple benefits: more nature, less flooding, more carbon locked up in trees and soils, fewer droughts, less pollution, more wild places for people to enjoy. We hope that this project will be the pathfinder for a route map to the revival of rivers and their catchment areas that can benefit every corner of England, and the rest of the UK.

We are delighted to be part of what is an immensely important project, both from a perspective of combating climate change with more trees but also for showing how it is essential they are planted in the right places.

Tree establishment near rivers and in their catchments can have significant benefits for people and wildlife, from natural flood management to stabilising riverbanks and reducing sediment flow into water courses, to creating great places for people to enjoy.

This commitment from Defra could be catalytic in supporting the Riverscapes partnership to start to really deliver the transformational change needed to meet the threats of climate change and wildlife loss.

With 90 per cent of UK floodplains not fit for purpose and creating flood issues for communities, we fully recognise the value of trees to our river corridors in helping to slow flood waters, soak up carbon and keep rivers cool in the face of rising temperatures.

This work will enhance the projects we already have underway where our primary focus has been the conservation and health of the river channel itself. This partnership and funding will allow us to look at the wider river corridor to further enhance this work.

As members of the Riverscapes partnership with Defra, we are delighted to be a part of this first big first step towards paying farmers to create a nature recovery network of mosaic habitats along our rivers, working together to breathe life back into our land.

We hope in time farmers will be incentivised not only to plant trees but to create wetlands, floodplain meadows and other spaces for natural processes and wildlife to regenerate in riparian buffer zones.

Collaboration between Government, industry, landowners, communities, and the NGO sector is key if we are to help communities build resilience to the climate and the ecological emergency. The Riverscapes partnership looks forward to helping engage the farming community, connecting landowners with each other and much-needed public money, and developing systemic solutions like blended finance, empowering rapid change in how we manage our rivers and land.

Today’s announcement is a key action of the recently publishedEngland Trees Action Planwhich outlined the Government’s strategy to get more trees in the ground that will help to deliver wide ranging benefits for nature, climate and people, and contributes towards the commitment to treble planting rates in England by the end of this Parliament.

Outside of the catchments targeted by this new Riverscapes Partnership, Defra’s other Woodland Creation Partnerships are supporting land owners to plant trees to meet a range of objectives, including along watercourses.",England Woodland Creation Offer grant,Welfare,,id25_111

Face. Space’ public information campaign urges the public to continue to wash their hands, cover their face and make space to control infection rates and avoid a second peak.",Department of Health and Social Care,9 September 2020,"A new science based public information campaign will be launched ahead of winter to highlight how everyone can help to stop the spread of the virus by remembering to wash their hands, cover their face and make space.

‘Hands. Face. Space’ will run across TV, radio, print, out of home, social and digital display advertising, as well as on community media channels and will be supported by a variety of public and private sector partners throughout the coming weeks.

As part of this campaign, a new video is being released to show exactly how coronavirus spreads indoors. With people expected to spend more time inside during the winter, the film – produced with the help of scientific experts – encourages the public to follow simple steps to reduce the risk of infection.

Through a scientifically based reconstruction of everyday scenarios the film shows how the interactions between people, surfaces and the air spread the virus. The film also reflects how coronavirus spreads through droplets that come out of our nose and mouth. This is a powerful reminder to the public of the importance of remaining aware of their surroundings and following the guidance.

Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty said:

As we approach winter and inevitably spend more time indoors, we need the public to keep following this important advice to control the spread of the virus.

‘Hands. Face. Space’ emphasises important elements of the guidance we want everybody to remember: wash your hands regularly, use a face covering when social distancing is not possible and try to keep your distance from those not in your household.

Following these simple steps could make a significant difference in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 and help protect you and your friends, colleagues and family from the virus.

The compelling evidence combined with expert recommendations around ‘Hands. Face. Space’ includes:

While coronavirus is not likely to survive for long periods of time on outdoor surfaces in sunlight, it can live for more than 24 hours in indoor environments(see endnote 1). Washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or using hand sanitizer, regularly throughout the day will reduce the risk of catching or passing on the virus(see endnote 2).

Coronavirus is carried in the air by tiny respiratory droplets that carry the virus. Larger droplets can land on other people or on surfaces they touch while smaller droplets, called aerosols, can stay in the air indoors for at least 5 minutes, and often much longer if there is no ventilation(see endnote 3). Face coverings reduce the dispersion of these droplets, meaning if you’re carrying the virus you’re less likely to spread it when you exhale(see endnote 4).

Transmission of the virus is most likely to happen within 2 metres, with risk increasing exponentially at shorter distances(see endnote 5). While keeping this exact distance isn’t always possible, remaining mindful of surroundings and continuing to make space has a powerful impact when it comes to containing the spread.

While coronavirus deaths have significantly reduced, the virus is still circulating in communities and impacting people of all ages across the UK. ‘Hands. Face. Space’ are simple but vital behaviours that have the power to protect the public from both the short and potential long-term impact of coronavirus.

Professor Catherine Noakes, part of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) who specialises in airborne infections said:

Coronavirus is emitted in tiny droplets when we breathe, talk, laugh or cough. Other people can be exposed to these when they are close to someone with the virus or they are in a poorly ventilated room for a long time.

Wearing a face covering prevents most of these droplets from being released into the air, and can also reduce the number of droplets that you are exposed to. That is why wearing a face covering serves as a vital first line of defence against catching and spreading the virus, along with regular and thorough handwashing with soap and water and maintaining a safe distance wherever possible.

Poppy, 27 from London and suffering from long-term COVID-19 symptoms:

There is a worrying trend at the moment for people who don’t consider themselves as being at a high-risk group to be dismissive of how the virus may impact them. Before having coronavirus, I was fit and healthy. Now 6 months after supposedly recovering, I’m still dealing with the aftermath of the virus which affects my everyday life. You really don’t know how this will impact you and just because you’re not classed as vulnerable – doesn’t mean you’re not at risk.

The public are encouraged to continue to be vigilant of coronavirus symptoms which include a new continuous cough, high temperature, or a loss or change in your sense of taste or smell. If you or someone you know, displays any symptoms, no matter how mild, please get a free test by calling 119 or visiting NHS.uk

The new NHS Test and Trace service helps identify, contain and control coronavirus, reduce the spread of the virus and save lives. We all have a vital role to play in tackling coronavirus and NHS Test and Trace will help us return life to as close to normal as possible in a way that is safe and avoids a second peak.

If you have coronavirus symptoms you must self-isolate immediately with other members of your household and book a test on the website:nhs.uk/coronavirusor via 119.

Those who have tested positive for coronavirus will be contacted by the service by text, email or phone – and asked to share information about their recent close contacts. Close contacts could include household members, people with whom they have been in direct contact, or within 2 metres for more than 15 minutes.

As Prince of Wales, His Majesty expressed a deep love and concern for England’s wildlife, natural and rural places, frequently reflecting on his love of walking and its role in promoting a healthy mind and body.

The plans will see the creation of a new ‘King’s Series of National Nature Reserves’, with five major National Nature Reserves named every year for the next five years - 25 in total.

The first - the Lincolnshire Coronation Coast National Nature Reserve - will be declared by Natural England this summer. Over 12 square miles in area, it contains a wonderful variety of sand dunes, saltmarsh, mudflats and freshwater marshes, which support many breeding and wintering birds, natterjack toads, special plants and insects.

The remaining four National Nature Reserves for 2023-2024 will be confirmed at a later date, but are likely to include the Mendip Hills in Somerset, Moccas Park in Herefordshire, Ingleborough in North Yorkshire and Lullington in East Sussex.

As the government’s focus moves on from an era of nature conservation to nature recovery to create spaces for wildlife to thrive, this new series showcases our ambition for bigger, better and more connected spaces for nature – building on the 221 declared in the reign of her late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

For more than five decades our King has been at the forefront of thinking about the need to restore our depleted natural world. He has highlighted the vital importance of sustainable agriculture, questions of water security, solutions to climate change and the urgency of moving to a circular economy inspired by nature. He’s helped make progress on all these and other subjects while having people’s wellbeing at the centre of his ideas.

It is fitting that today Natural England begins the process of declaring 25 new National Nature Reserves that will be called the ‘King’s Series’, marking His Majesty’s Coronation and the new era of nature recovery that is now enshrined in national law and global agreements.

The National Nature Reserves are the jewels in the crown of England’s nature and they are there for wildlife and people alike. The first one in this new series will be a very substantial area of protected habitat on the Lincolnshire coast, through which a section of the England Coast Path will soon be opened by Natural England.

National Nature Reserves are the most important places for nature in England and provide significant benefits for nature conservation, science and people.

Work leading to the declaration of the first seven NNRs in England in 1952 took place during the Second World War, laying a legacy for future generations. Over the last 70 years, during the reign of her late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, 221 NNRs were declared, focusing on nature conservation and science and providing opportunities for people to enjoy nature.

His Majesty has held number of patronages of wildlife and conservation charities, including the Wildlife Trusts. As Prince of Wales he has also worked to encourage the private sector to work to respond to climate change and increase their focus on sustainability with more than 500 CEOs part of his Sustainable Markets Initiative, including the heads of some of the world’s biggest financial institutions.

Through our Environmental Improvement Plan we want to be the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than we inherited it and in this Coronation year even more people will get out and experience our incredible wildlife and landscapes

This Coronation year will also see the very first National Nature Reserves Week which will take place from 20th to 29th May 2023.

114,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-end-badger-cull-with-new-tb-eradication-strategy,Press release,Government to end badger cull with new TB eradication strategy,First Bovine TB strategy in a decade to end the badger cull and drive down TB rates to protect farmers' livelihoods,"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs and Daniel Zeichner MP",30 August 2024,"Work on a comprehensive new TB eradication strategy has been launched today (30 August) to end the badger cull and drive down Bovine Tuberculosis (TB) rates to save cattle and farmers’ livelihoods.

Over the past decade, TB has had a devastating impact on British livestock and wildlife. Over 278,000 cattle have been compulsorily slaughtered and over 230,000 badgers have been killed in efforts to control the disease, costing taxpayers more than £100 million every year.

For the first time in over a decade, the Government will introduce a new bovine TB eradication strategy working with farmers, vets, scientists and conservationists to rapidly strengthen and deploy a range of disease control measures.

The new strategy will mark a significant step-change in approach to tackle this devastating disease, driving down TB rates and saving farmers’ livelihoods and businesses. It will use a data-led and scientific approach to end the badger cull by the end of this parliament.

The work to end the badger cull starts immediately and includes:

First badger population survey in over a decade: The last major badger survey was carried out between 2011-13, leaving policy makers with no clear idea of the impact culling techniques have on our badger populations. The Government will work at pace to launch a new survey this winter to estimate badger abundance and population recovery to illustrate the impact of widespread culling over the past decade.

New national wildlife surveillance programme: After a decade of culling, the prevalence of TB in remaining badger populations is largely unknown. The development of a new national wildlife surveillance programme will provide an up-to-date understanding of disease in badgers and other wildlife such as deer. Together with updated estimates of badger abundance, this will unlock a data-driven approach to inform how and where TB vaccines and other eradication measures are rapidly deployed to drive down TB rates and protect farmers’ livelihoods.

Establish a new Badger Vaccinator Field Force: Badger vaccinations create progressively healthier badger populations that are less susceptible to catching and transmitting TB. A new Badger Vaccinator Field Force will increase badger vaccination at pace to drive down TB rates and protect badgers.

Badger vaccination study: To supplement the Field Force, the Government will rapidly analyse the effect of badger vaccination on the incidence of TB in cattle to encourage farmers to take part and provide greater confidence that doing so will have a positive effect on their cattle.

In addition, we will accelerate work on the development of a cattle vaccine, which is at the forefront of innovative solutions to help eradicate this disease. The next stage of field trials will commence in the coming months. Our aim is to deliver an effective cattle TB vaccination strategy within the next few years to accelerate progress towards achieving officially TB free (OTF) status for England.

The full strategy will be co-designed with farmers, vets, scientists and conservationists. It will consider a range of further measures including boosting cattle testing, reducing the spread of disease through cattle movements, and deploying badger vaccination on a wider, landscape scale. This will build on Professor Sir Charles Godfray’s 2018 independent strategy review.

Bovine tuberculosis has devastated British farmers and wildlife for far too long.

It has placed dreadful hardship and stress on farmers who continue to suffer the loss of valued herds and has taken a terrible toll on our badger populations.

No more. Our comprehensive TB eradication package will allow us to end the badger cull by the end of this parliament and stop the spread of this horrific disease.

Bovine tuberculosis is one of the most difficult and prolonged animal disease challenges we face, causing devastation for farming communities.

There is no single way to combat it, and a refreshed strategy will continue to be led by the very best scientific and epidemiological evidence. With the disease on a downward trajectory, we are at a crucial point. Working in collaboration with government and stakeholders will be the only way we achieve our target to eradicate bovine tuberculosis in England by 2038.

As chair of the bTB Partnership for England, I am delighted to hear Minister Zeichner’s intention to refresh the current bTB strategy. Ten years after its launch, the time is right to look again at the tools we use to tackle this persistent disease.

Bovine TB is the common enemy, not farmers or wildlife groups. Only by working together, will we reach our goal.

The government will also publish additional information about animal and herd-level bTB risk – for example, the date and type of the most recent TB test completed in the herd of origin of that animal and how long the animal has been in the herd.

This greater level of detail will be made available on ibTB – afree to access interactive mapset up to help cattle farmers and their vets understand the level of bovine TB in their area and manage the risks when purchasing cattle.

Today’s announcement ensures the government meets its manifesto commitment and represents a new direction in defeating this disease that will both protect the farming community and preserve wildlife.

Existing cull processes will be honoured to ensure clarity for farmers involved in these culls whilst new measures can be rolled out and take effect.

The Bovine TB Partnership is a stakeholder-government collaboration established as a driving force for further progress towards disease eradication.  It is made up of experts from government (Defra, APHA and Natural England), as well as farmers, veterinarians, scientists, academics, and ecologists/conservationists, including representatives from the National Farmers Union, British Veterinary Association, British Cattle Veterinary Association, and the National Trust .",Badger vaccination study & new Badger Vaccinator Field Force,Institutional,Welfare,id25_114

Public Health England’s (PHE) study will add to data on antibody and virus prevalence already being collected through national surveillance programmes and other nationwide studies, which report weekly.

The initial phase will collect data from up to 100 schools from across England, including 15 schools in London, with results available over the summer.  We are targeting around 200 staff and children at each school.

Data will be fed back to inform a potential second phase study in September.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said:

A critical pillar of our COVID-19 testing strategy is surveillance – testing samples of the population to gain a deeper understanding of the spread of COVID-19, especially in those who may not have symptoms.

This study will help us better understand how common asymptomatic and mild cases of COVID-19 are so that we can support parents, pupils and teachers and support staff, and inform our ongoing response to this new virus.

Generally, children have been shown to be asymptomatic.  This surveillance study will seek to better understand rates of transmission in children and adults within schools over the coming months by swab testing to see if they have the virus.

A small proportion of schools will also be offered antibody tests by phlebotomists, medical professionals who are fully trained to collect blood samples from patients. Roughly 40% of schools selected for the study will receive antibody and swab tests before the summer holidays.

Participation from schools is on a voluntary basis, and all parents and guardians will be asked to provide informed consent for their children or dependents prior to testing.

We are working closely with the Department for Education to identify suitable schools who may wish to be part of the initial phase of the study.

Dr Shamez Ladhani, Paediatric Infectious Diseases Consultant, Public Health England, said:

We are delighted this study is up and running in schools across England. By working with students and staff we’ll be able to better understand infection and transmission of asymptomatic and mild infections of COVID-19 that may have otherwise remained undetected.

The results of this study will play an important role in informing wider surveillance planned for educational settings in the autumn term.

Through active surveillance, contact tracing and the close monitoring of any clusters of cases, we are committed to ensuring the safety of students and staff returning to school in the coming weeks and months.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said:

We know that being in school is vital for children’s education and their wellbeing.

Last week, primary schools began to welcome back some pupils and secondary schools will begin to do the same from 15 June, as part of our phased and cautious approach to getting children and young people back into the classroom.

Studies like this will be invaluable as we continue moving forward with those plans, and help us assess the next steps for getting all children back into schools, nurseries and colleges with their friends and teachers.

The participating schools will issue invitations to take part in the study and parents or carers will have an opportunity to ask questions and will be encouraged to involve their children and explain how they can help by taking part.

Children will receive age-appropriate information sheets and will be encouraged to co-sign the consent form with their parents or carers.

We want to ensure that pupils and staff receive the best possible care and treatment from clinical staff collecting swab and blood tests. We are seeking Headteacher and parent permissions prior to any data collection

The testing procedures are completely safe. The test to determine whether someone currently has the virus involves swab of the inside of their nose and the back of their throat, using a long cotton bud. Trained paediatric staff will take all blood samples from children. Trained medical professionals will visit schools to carry out the testing.

The antibody test to determine whether someone has had the virus and developed antibodies requires a blood sample.

Surveillance studies form part of pillar 4 of the government’s COVID-19 testing strategy, under which several national level studies have already launched. The studies aim to conduct UK-wide surveillance testing to learn more about the spread of the disease and help inform the development of new tests and treatments.

This new sector-specific study builds on the data being gathered at a national level through swab and antibody tests conducted as part of an Office for National Statistics (ONS) COVID-19 Infection Survey which has tested over 35,000 households to date, and an Ipsos MORI study of 100,000 people looking at rates of antibodies across England. To date these studies have administered over 200,000 tests since the end of April.",Surveillance study,Informational,,id25_117

207 Squadron has a long history as a bomber unit and is a direct descendant of No 7 Squadron of the Royal Naval Air Service, which was formed in 1916. With the formation of the Royal Air Force on 1 April 1918, the squadron was renumbered as 207 Squadron, before re-equipping with the Handley Page O/400 bomber, with which it carried out long-range night attacks on railway centres and aerodromes until the Armistice, by which time it had dropped a total of 587 tons of bombs.

After operating the outdated Fairey Battle aircraft at the start of the Second World War the squadron became the first to be equipped with the new twin-engined Avro Manchester bomber, carrying out its first offensive mission of the Second World War on 24 February 1941 in a raid on a Hipper Class cruiser in the French port of Brest.

In early 1942 the squadron was re-equipped with the Lancaster, and the squadron participated in most of the major raids of the war, including attacks on targets as far afield as Berlin, Genoa, Gdynia and the experimental station at Peenemunde on the Baltic coast.

The final wartime mission, an attack on Hitler’s mountain retreat at Berchtesgaden in Bavaria, was flown on 25 April 1945. Overall, the squadron flew 4,563 operational sorties on 481 raids and lost 148 aircraft (17 Manchesters and 131 Lancasters); a further eight Manchesters and 19 Lancasters were destroyed in crashes. Casualties were high; the squadron suffered 954 fatalities whilst its personnel were awarded seven Distinguished Service Orders, 115 Distinguished Flying Crosses and 92 Distinguished Flying Medals.

The squadron survived the run-down of the RAF that followed the end of the war, re-equipping with the Lincoln in 1949 before disbanding in 1950 to reform the following year with the Washington (the RAF name for the Boeing B-29).

Other post-war aircraft flown by the squadron included the Canberra, the Valiant V bomber and when reroled as a communications and transport squadron the Devon, Pembroke and Bassett.

The squadron carried out its role of transporting senior military officers until it disbanded in June 1984 upon the retirement of the Devon. Eighteen years were to pass before the squadron reappeared on 17 July 2002.

The squadron was reformed at RAF Linton-on-Ouse to provide basic fast jet pilot training to ‘wings’ standard on the Tucano T Mk1 aircraft for RAF and Royal Navy students. One notable member of the squadron during this time was Prince William, who completed a course on the Tucano as part of the training for the award of his RAF pilot’s ‘wings’ in April 2008.

The squadron standard was paraded for the last time at RAF Linton-on-Ouse, watched by hundreds of former squadron personnel and their families, senior officers and dignitaries including the Lord Mayor of York Councillor David Horton, the High Sheriff of North Yorkshire Mrs Alexandra Holford and the Dean of York The Very Reverend Keith Jones.

The parade featured the Central Band of the Royal Air Force and a flypast by Tucano aircraft - the last aircraft type operated by 207 Squadron.

The Reviewing Officer, Air Vice-Marshal Mike Lloyd, said:

This is undoubtedly a sad day for all those who have served on or alongside such a distinguished squadron, whose professionalism and standing are as strong today as when they were first formed in the August of 1915. However, those present today, both in the crowd and on parade, have ensured the squadron will be remembered not just through the factual records of history, but with pride and fond memories.

We are here to celebrate the record of a fine squadron, one whose history stretches back to the earliest days of aerial fighting. A squadron whose wartime record is so intertwined with the development of air combat that its DNA is present in almost every major advance that the Royal Air Force has made.

The squadron standard, which features battle honours from the First and Second World Wars, will be laid up at York Minster in a ceremony later this year.",Reformation of 207 Squadron with Tucano T Mk1 aircraft to provide basic fast jet pilot training,Institutional,,id25_119

This increases the number of bedrooms for single servicemen and women at the former Battle of Britain base to more than 600. It also avoids having to send the unwanted building units for disposal in landfill sites.

The new bedrooms are in addition to seven blocks of single living accommodation already delivered at RAF Northolt under Project MoDEL – the initiative to rationalise the military estate in London.

Demand for accommodation has risen at Northolt due to its expansion as a core site in London, particularly with the recent closures of the MoDEL disposal sites at RAF Uxbridge, RAF Bentley Priory and Mill Hill.

David Salmond, MoDEL project team leader said:

Defence Infrastructure Organisation’s top priority is to support our Armed Forces. There was an immediate need for living accommodation at Northolt and this solution delivered a fast and environment-friendly solution for RAF personnel.

Re-using perfectly good modular building units has delivered excellent, sustainability benefits. If a purchaser had not have been found, the modules could have been sent to a recycling centre for disposal as waste.

He added that the units had required only a light interior refurbishment and provided extra capacity on site, until a permanent solution can take full account of October’s Strategic Defence and Security Review.

Wing Commander Mike Smith Officer Commanding Support Wing RAF Northolt said:

We are particularly pleased with the recycling nature of this Project, as this is a core tenet of RAF Northolt’s sustainability agenda.

Since the closure of accommodation at Uxbridge, there has been insufficient Service accommodation for Northolt personnel and those visiting on-duty. As Northolt hosts the Regional Resettlement Centre this has been particularly challenging.

He added that the additional temporary accommodation would also lead to a considerable saving for the RAF, which would otherwise have had to rent flats or book hotels.",Re-using modular building units,Administrative,Other,id25_120

We’ve brought together more than half of the squadrons from across the UK to participate in a demonstration of our contingent capability,” said Squadron Leader Gary Lane, Officer Commanding 606 (Chiltern) Squadron.

Whilst it’s recognised that these Reserves will not deploy together as a force, the realism of the scenario here has replicated the mobilisation experiences they undergo when they are individual augmentees.

Warrant Officer Bill Bailey RAuxAF, Command Warrant Officer (Reserves), added:

We have lots of squadrons with different expertise, and by bringing them together we are able to replicate what they will experience on operations.

Within hours of arrival of the lead force elements, a large forward operating base was established in a fictitious overseas state. Out beyond the wire, RAF Regiment gunners drawn from four squadrons operated as one to provide security for the main force, which included a number of regular RAF units.

Chiltern Kite would not have been possible without the support of the Puma and Merlins of RAF Benson, the fuelling assets from Tactical Support Wing and 1 Police Squadron who have conducted trade training in the field for reserve policemen,” said Sqn Ldr Lane.

For helicopter crews the opportunity to practice missions used on operations to gain and retain currency in a variety of techniques was eagerly taken. This included tactical flying, carrying underslung loads and moving troops.

One of the largest contingents came from 4626 Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron based at RAF Lyneham whose 50 personnel included a Doctor, nurses, paramedics and physiotherapist worked in a tented Aeromedical Support Unit.

This is essentially a deployed A+E [Accident and Emergency] capability,” said Wing Commander Colin Mathieson. “The training we’re getting is basically testing the training we’ve done this year through a series of medical scenarios. We also have four personnel deployed with the RAF Regiment in the battlefield medic role.

And the scenario was intense:

The amount of training injects here in 48 hours the equivalent to a week at Bastion,” continued Wg Cdr Mathieson. “But it’s not just the clinical training; it’s using the clinical skills they’ve already got in a field scenario.

In a nearby building air movements personnel from 4624 (County of Oxford) Squadron, based at RAF Brize Norton, made preparations for the potential evacuation of ex-patriots and embassy staff via a passenger handing facility.

The benefit for us is to work on an forward operating base at short notice and to live in a field environment,” said WO Matt Dillon.

We are used to working in large main operating bases such as Camp Bastion and being here in very basic conditions means we have to improvise and think on our feet.

Based at RAF Henlow, 3 Police Squadron work closely on operations with their regular counterparts at 1 Police Squadron:

The exercise has been a unique opportunity for our police trainees to undertake their final environmental training in the field,” said Sqn Ldr Bev Peart, Chief of Staff 3 Police Wing (3 PW).

We usually do this on the airfield at RAF Henlow so to get out into the field in a realistic scenario with many other units and capabilities can only enhance the training we deliver. We’re used this on 3 PW as an opportunity to conduct collective training with both squadrons, Regular and Reserve, to further forge integration.

With the exercise over, the RAuxAF units returned to their RAF Stations; personnel ready to return to work on Monday morning and answer the inevitable question from colleagues: “Do anything interesting at the weekend?”

Members of the RAuxAF undertake key functions in support of operations such as intelligence, a wide variety of medical roles, logistics, media operations and force protection. There are twenty squadrons of the RAuxAF, comprising some 1,300 personnel. These reserves operate alongside regular RAF personnel, both in the UK and when deployed on operations and are a vital part of the front line RAF.",Exercise Chiltern Kite,Other,,id25_121

Running in the London Marathon on Sunday, LCpl MacMahon completed the course in three hours and 28 minutes, taking a massive 21 minutes off the previous record for running in a gas mask, which he claims was due in no small part to the new General Service Respirator (GSR) recently introduced to the RAF Regiment. He said:

I am very impressed with the newGSR; compared to the old S10 respirator it is almost as if you are running without one. I did hit a bit of a wall at around the 19-mile [30km] point, but I found that concentrating on the crowd seemed to help take my mind off the pain.

When asked about this, LCpl MacMahon said:

It is quite unusual for one squadron to have two world record holders.

Who knows,” he added. “We might be able to get together to attempt a combined record at next year’s marathon.

Part of the Jubilee Woods project marking The Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012, the woodland will also provide valuable forest cover for military training exercises. Local residents will be invited to plant trees later in the year.

Speaking about the project, Georgina McLeod, Head of Diamond Woods at the Woodland Trust said:

It’s great that we’ve been able to work with DIO and Prince William of Gloucester Barracks to ensure that we have a Diamond Wood at the home of the Woodland Trust. We hope people in Grantham will get involved in the creation of the wood in the coming months.

The Diamond Wood initiative is part of a larger project being undertaken by DIO and WT which could see thousands of hectares of woodland planted to help British soldiers train more effectively for military operations, whilst helping to double the UK’s woodland cover. This began with 176,000 trees being planted at the Defence Training Estate (DTE) range at Warcop in Cumbria last year.

DIO Deputy Chief Executive David Olney said:

We’re delighted to continue our partnership with the Woodland Trust and respond to military training needs in providing woodland cover to benefit soldiers preparing for operations.

Commander Carol Betteridge and Royal Marine William Cassidy Little unveiled the commemorative plaque ceremonially opening the medical and dental centre.

Cdr Betteridge was a former commanding officer (CO) of Camp Bastion Hospital in Afghanistan, supporting 3 Commando Brigade on combat operations by treating front line casualties. She now works at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital’s Royal Centre for Defence Medicine in Birmingham.

Cdr Betteridge said:

This facility is a high priority and provides the highest possible standard of care to make the commandos fit for the job they do. It has been a great honour to unveil the plaque with Marine Cassidy [Little].

Marine Little was deployed as a medic with J Company of 42 Commando in Afghanistan.

He said:

I became a patient as I lost my left leg a year ago on deployment when I got blown up by the Taliban. The medical readiness of a unit is one of the hidden areas that not many people know about.

The conditions that [Royal Marines] work in, whether they are in Afghanistan or on Dartmoor, mean that you need to be at a peak of medical fitness.

The new sick bay brings us into a new age as we understand more of the medical and dental needs. On the plus side the medical and dental centre will also provide medical education.

The CO of 42 Commando, Lieutenant Colonel Neil Sutherland, said:

This is an extremely important facility. Our previous medical facilities were very dated and not fit for purpose for a Royal Marines Commando unit in 2012. The medical department had been split up, but what we have now is everything on one site for physio, dental and medical; they are all under one roof.

Now the quality and care for the Royal Marines is far improved. Our sick bay is a mix of military and civilian people. When we deploy, the civilians remain here and will be able to maintain the high standards whilst we are deployed.

Dental welfare and fitness of a unit is extremely important. We need to be able to maintain high levels of fitness in the unit. Rehabilitation is absolutely key to our medical practitioners.

Physio is important day-to-day business which also includes people who get injured on exercise; we need to get them back to full fitness as soon as possible.

The dental section of the centre offers the highest standards in dental healthcare, allowing concurrent treatment by dentists, hygienists and dental nurses using the latest equipment and techniques.

Although the dental team is able to use portable dental equipment to support the commando unit on the front line and other deployments worldwide, the new building will allow efficient delivery of complex and routine dentistry in order to maintain the dental health of the Royal Marines at their base.

The Director of Royal Naval Dental Services, Surgeon Captain Richard Norris, said:

The dental health of the Royal Marines has been an important component of our military effectiveness for many years. This new facility will allow the dental services to continue to offer the highest standards of care and treatment available.

Surgeon Lieutenant Amelia Pedrick, 42 Commando Senior Dental Surgeon, said:

We are looking forward to increasing the range of hygienist and preventive dentistry available to our patients; Royal Marines need and deserve the best dental care available and we are now in a position to deliver.

The team is made up from personnel across the Services who are normally based at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM), the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) Headley Court, the Defence School for Healthcare Studies (Birmingham), and the Army Training Regiment (ATR) Bassingbourne (Cambridgeshire).

Very seriously ill servicemen and women who are injured on operations are flown back from Camp Bastion to theRCDMat Queen Elizabeth Hospital to receive world-class, and often life-saving, medical treatment.

Squadron Leader Chris Stagles, adjutant of theRCDM, said:

We hope that by doing this challenge we will not only be raising vital funds, but also highlighting the work of these fantastic organisations to the wider community. It is our way of giving something back to the organisations that give so much to our Service personnel.

Although Mr Cameron and Mr Obama did help to serve lunch - meeting and paying tribute to the men and women in uniform from both sides of the Atlantic.

In addition to the 47 US Service personnel attending the barbecue, there were also 45 UK Service and civilian personnel representing the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, British Army, Royal Air Force and the Ministry of Defence.

All have served in operational theatres on joint US-UK deployments, including Iraq, Afghanistan or both - some for multiple deployments. A few of the individuals from the UK at the barbecue have worked very closely with US units.

Like their American colleagues, some of the UK personnel have received combat decorations and some have been decorated by the US military as well for their exemplary service.

Among the four Royal Navy personnel present was Lieutenant Commander Victoria Dale-Smith, a Commando Sea King pilot who flew missions in Iraq at the start of Op TELIC in 2003.

One of the six Royal Marines in attendance was Lance Corporal Joe LeBorgne who, during his latest deployment to Afghanistan in 2010, was part of a patrol tasked with rescuing the US crew of a Black Hawk helicopter which had landed in the vicinity of his patrol base.

20 members of the British Army, ten RAF personnel, and five Ministry of Defence civilians also attended with their wives and husbands.

Each of the personnel have played their own particular role on operations - Lieutenant Colonel Gerry Ewart-Brookes’ regiment was heavily involved in the handover of Sangin from UK to US control, while Wing Commander David Scott Heather was awarded the US Meritorious Service Medal for Operation IRAQI FREEDOM.

Michael Goldsack, a MOD civilian, was deployed to Afghanistan with the Defence Support Group, who maintain and repair military vehicles and equipment, and Sergeant David McIlwraith was deployed with the MOD Police (MDP) and was involved with the training of Afghan National Police personnel.

He said:

Right from the start, MDP officers like myself have been training and mentoring the Afghan National Police as part of the UK’s contribution out there, working alongside the military.

Recently, we had a particularly strong and effective relationship with 5 SCOTS [5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland] at the Helmand Police Training Centre.

Today was really special. As a small part of a huge operation, to be honoured in this way today is just fantastic.

As patron of the expedition, Prince William spoke at the reception to congratulate the teams on their extraordinary achievement. He said:

I find it hugely poignant that the participants in the Scott-Amundsen Centenary Race are all British servicemen. All but one of the original members of Scott’s team were serving sailors or soldiers too.

That today’s Armed Forces can produce individuals to emulate the extraordinary feats of their forebears is something we should take great heart from.

In a rapidly changing world, it is reassuring to know that two things, at least, haven’t changed this past hundred years: the fortitude of our men and women in uniform, and that very particular British trait of always seeking to push the boundaries… or, as many gathered here would have it, to go ‘beyond that last blue mountain barred with snow, across that angry or that glimmering sea’[*].

That the race chose to support, through the Royal British Legion, Battle Back’s new centre in Lilleshall could not be more appropriate. The same levels of courage and determination demonstrated by our Antarctic heroes in 1912 and 2012 are shown each and every day by our wounded servicemen and women. Their courage and spirit simply humble me.

True to history, the Amundsen team, led by Lieutenant Colonel Henry Worsley, from The Rifles, reached the South Pole first on 9 January 2012 and the Scott team, led by Warrant Officer Class 2 Mark Langridge, from The Parachute Regiment, arrived a week later on 17 January 2012 - exactly 100 years after the original Scott expedition.

Also in the Amundsen team were Staff Sergeant Lennie Browne, from The Parachute Regiment, and Warrant Officer Class 2 Lou Rudd, from the Royal Marines. Joining Warrant Officer Class 2 Langridge in the Scott team were Staff Sergeant Viv Vicary, from The Rifles, and Staff Sergeant Kev Johnson, from The Parachute Regiment.

En route, team members paid their respects to Captain Scott and his four comrades who perished on the journey back from the South Pole. Their tragic loss is seared in the nation’s memory as an enduring narrative of duty and sacrifice.

The royal couple chatted to team members and their families about their epic challenge at the reception, which is one of three events they are attending ahead of their first wedding anniversary on Sunday.

Lieutenant Colonel Worsley said:

There is a history of royal patronage for major polar expeditions and we’re honoured to have the Duke of Cambridge as patron in this important centenary year.

It’s been an absolute privilege for us to be able to follow in the footsteps of the great Antarctic explorers. The journey was formidably demanding, but so worthwhile knowing that we are raising money for the Royal British Legion’s fantastic work.

What we, as a British Army team, have gone through to reach the Pole is nothing compared to what injured and disabled fellow servicemen and women will go through for the rest of their lives.

National President of the Royal British Legion, Lieutenant General Sir John Kiszely, said:

This extraordinary Army expedition was a pursuit to recreate one of the most challenging and difficult journeys ever attempted by man.

Even with modern equipment, it tested the courage, ability, strength and endurance of the team members to their limit, and in doing so demonstrated all that is admirable about our Armed Forces.

The Royal British Legion is proud to be supported by the Scott-Amundsen Centenary Race, which is raising vital funds towards their £30m commitment to the new Battle Back Centre in Lilleshall to help wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women on their personal journeys of recovery.

The centre is focused on rebuilding confidence, ability and motivation through adaptive sports and adventurous training. It is a place where even small steps can feel like great leaps of accomplishment for young men and women who are used to being at the peak of physical fitness.

Sapper Clive Smith, a 26 year-old, double-leg amputee from 33 Engineer Regiment (Explosive Ordnance Disposal), was seriously injured in an IED blast in Afghanistan in 2010. He recently attended the Battle Back Centre, and was at the reception yesterday. He said:

It was an honour to meet the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. I spent a while chatting to them about my time at the Battle Back Centre. For wounded Service people like me, the centre will make all the difference in recovery.

I took part in activities like wheelchair basketball and bowling, and managed to scale a wall while rock climbing, which was brilliant.

The encouragement I received from the staff and others on the course was fantastic, and none of this would have been possible without the important work the Legion do supporting the Armed Forces.

The cutting-edge, high-tech equipment used in protecting our national security only comes to life with your skill, professionalism and commitment. You should be very proud of what has been accomplished in the past twelve months - in Afghanistan, in Libya, and on standing tasks around the world defending our dependent territories, protecting our trade routes, and contributing to multinational operations.

This has been achieved by military and civilian personnel working together as a team and making sure that, across Defence, we deliver for the country.

In Afghanistan, you’ve been working hard to bring security where there has been none, and help build Afghan forces strong enough to protect their own country from insurgency. Security in large swathes of Afghanistan is now being provided by Afghans for Afghans and it is working.

This is the way we will diminish in the long-term the terrorist threat on our streets here at home. Afghanistan will remain the first priority for the Ministry of Defence in the year ahead.

In Libya, your contribution has been remarkable. Even with the enduring campaign in Afghanistan, you have shown that we have the capability and the capacity to respond when the national interest requires, in this case to prevent the return of a festering rogue state on Europe’s borders.

After 40 years of Gaddafi’s brutal regime, Libyans are finally free to determine their own destiny and Britain can be proud of the part we have played.

Those of you who will be away from home this Christmas are in our thoughts. I know this is a particularly difficult time to be separated from your families and loved ones. I speak for the nation when I say we are grateful for your commitment to our defence.

We remember in particular those members of our Armed Forces who have lost their lives this year, fighting for our national security. Their sacrifice, and the sacrifice of those who have been seriously injured, will not be forgotten.

I know this has been a challenging year for all those in Defence as we begin the tough job of implementing the changes required to get the defence programme back on track. I regret, in particular, the cuts in personnel that are required.

In some cases, people who have given long periods of loyal service will be leaving us. But the way to secure a strong future for Defence is to get the budget back on track, and we must not waiver in our determination to deliver the balanced programme for the future that will remove the cloud of uncertainty from the MOD.

We are making good progress. We have secured real terms increases in the equipment and support budget for the next Spending Review period. This means, for the first time in years, we can be increasingly confident that our vision for the powerful, formidable and adaptable Future Force 2020 is built on firm foundations.

The Government also remains committed to rebuilding the Armed Forces Covenant. We can only go as fast as resources permit, but with the Covenant now enshrined in the law of the land, the nation’s commitment to our Armed Forces is stronger than ever before.

Called ‘Think Before You…’, the guidance will be incorporated into Phase 1 training, when applicants first join the Services, and into other mandated training materials for serving personnel.

The Chief of the Defence Staff’s Strategic Communications Officer, said:

Social media has enabled our personnel to stay in touch with their families and their friends no matter where they are in the world. We want our men and women to embrace the use of sites like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and YouTube, but also want them to be aware of the risks that sharing too much information may pose. You don’t always know who else is watching in cyberspace.

The MOD Headquarters has its own Facebook, YouTube and Twitter feeds and we see no reason to stop our personnel from tweeting or posting on their own walls. But the MOD has a responsibility to warn personnel of the risks they could be exposing themselves to, hence the launch of this new campaign.

‘Think Before You…’ is a reminder that personal and operational security should be a primary concern and that social media merely provides a different context where sensitive details can be found.

The Chief of the Defence Staff’s Strategic Communications Officer added:

We do not want to scare Service personnel, families and veterans and we certainly do not want them to stop using social media. We are not here to gag people because we acknowledge the ubiquity and significant benefits that social media offers to people and the MOD. I am a big fan of Facebook and Twitter and I use them on a regular basis. These channels are vital to communicating in a digital age.

Dr Fox said:

The United Kingdom and Canada, in addition to being close partners in NATO, have a strong relationship deeply rooted in our shared history. With their significant contribution to operations in Afghanistan and Libya the Canadian Armed Forces have set a fine example for other NATO members to follow.

The Canadian combat mission in Afghanistan came to an end in July this year; they remain engaged as an ISAF partner in the transition process through their Afghan National Security Forces training programme.

Canada is also a key ally in NATO’s Operation UNIFIED PROTECTOR (the Libya mission) of which a Canadian, Lieutenant General Charles Bouchard, is the current commander.

Canada, like the UK, is working through a Defence Reform process that aims to makes its Armed Forces more efficient and more deployable.

Speaking after the meeting, Dr Fox said:

Both our nations are facing economic constraints and I welcome Canada’s engagement in their own Defence Reform effort, aimed at delivering a more efficient and deployable Armed Forces.

The MOD has not confirmed the involvement or otherwise of UK Special Forces (SF). We do not normally comment on SF matters and we can see no reason to change that policy on this occasion.

NATO has confirmed that weapons seized in a recent operation by Afghan and ISAF forces in Nimruz were supplied by elements within the Iranian regime and were destined for the Taliban.

Dr Fox said:

This confirms my often repeated view of the dangers that Iran poses not only through its nuclear programme but its continuing policy of destabilising its neighbours.

Supplying weapons to help the Taliban kill ISAF soldiers is a clear example of the threat they pose.

Mr Hague said:

I am extremely concerned by the latest evidence that Iran continues to supply the Taliban with weaponry - weapons clearly intended to provide the Taliban with the capability to kill Afghan and ISAF soldiers from significant range.

The detailed technical analysis, together with the circumstances of the seizure, leave us in no doubt that the weaponry recovered came from Iran.

This is completely unacceptable. It is not the behaviour of a responsible neighbour. It is at odds with Iran’s claim to the international community and to its own people that it supports stability and security in Afghanistan.

The idea to reintroduce them in the local area was the brainchild of Lance Corporal Emma Pengilly, of D Company, 5th Battalion The Rifles (5 RIFLES), who operate in the region.

Lance Corporal Pengilly discussed the project with the local Chief of the Afghan Uniform Police, Lieutenant Mirza Khan, and then raised the idea with local Afghans, obtaining a positive response from the mullah of the local mosque.

Lieutenant Khan attended a shura, or meeting, with local elders and asked if they would like kites for their children - and the answer was resoundingly positive. Within minutes of the shura ending, one of the kites, distinctive by its Afghan traditional colours of green and yellow, was seen flying high in the sky.

Lance Corporal Pengilly said:

The mullah of the local mosque burst into a huge smile the first time we mentioned the idea to him, and the local people have responded really well to the idea of the kites.

It was great to see them feeling secure and thinking towards passing an important part of their heritage onto their children.

Lieutenant Khan said:

I used to fly kites when I was young and I really enjoyed giving out the kites so that the children can fly them. I wish there was enough for me to have a kite to fly myself!

Major Matt Baker, Officer Commanding D Company, 5 RIFLES, said:

This is a really important sign that local people are no longer afraid of the Taliban. This exercise has shown that members of the community are looking to pass their heritage to the next generation, a sign that people are looking forward to a prosperous future.

Following on from their experiences of compound clearance work in Afghanistan, the 45 men are now training to operate in more complex and industrial urban environments.

Working in groups of between eight and 24, the exercise at Strone Camp allowed X-Ray Company to practise their skills ahead of ‘Scottish Lion’, a larger training exercise in early May.

The buildings at Strone Camp, just outside Faslane, have been specially adapted for house-to-house fighting.

The camp itself was once home to the Admiralty Hydro Ballistic Research Establishment, but since the 1980s the disused buildings have been used for modern urban combat training.

The one-time tank building - used to test the hydro-ballistic properties of torpedoes and missiles - has now been converted into a training centre for FIBUA (fighting in a built-up area, known more commonly by troops as FISHing - fighting in someone’s house).

Single-source contracts currently account for 40 per cent of all MOD procurement and in-service support of equipment.

The Department is today launching a public consultation on how to take forward the findings of the review, which examines the UK’s existing framework for pricing single-source contracts and considers whether, in future, costs can be cut and efficiency increased while making UK industry more competitive on the world market.

The Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology, Peter Luff, said:

Current arrangements for single-source procurement have been in place for over 40 years and it is clear that they are no longer fit for purpose. That is why I asked Lord Currie to review them.

I welcome his report and its recommendations to deliver better value for money to both our Armed Forces and the UK taxpayer. Through careful implementation, I would be disappointed if we couldn’t deliver savings rising to £200m per year - although I expect this will take a number of years to reach its full value.

To examine the savings potential and the implementation of these recommendations, I am now launching an extensive consultation across industry and government.

Lord Currie said:

When Defence Minister Peter Luff asked me to undertake a review of the regulations surrounding single-source procurement of military equipment and services, it quickly became apparent that they needed to change.

There are sound reasons why single-source will continue to represent a significant part of total MOD procurement. It is thus essential that the governing regime for this activity is robust and fit for purpose. This is the aim of our recommendations.

I am encouraged by the changes the senior MOD team are already introducing to address the past problems of defence procurement. Our proposals aim to complement and strengthen these changes.

Lord Currie’s recommendations focus on achieving greater transparency of costs and strengthening industry’s incentives to be efficient. The benefits that could potentially be gained from implementing the report include:

a more open relationship between MOD and the defence industry, ensuring standardised cost data is provided by contractors to the MOD - helping to provide greater transparency of costs which would improve the MOD’s ability to negotiate realistic prices

incentivising industry to be more efficient and tackling the cost-base while allowing industry to make reasonable profits - companies will become more competitive on the international market

Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) will provide fewer data-reporting requirements and there will be a simplified profit rate process. Larger contractors will provide an annual statement on how they have engaged SMEs in their supply chain.

The report also suggests the new arrangements will provide greater transparency over the overhead costs industry attempts to pass onto the MOD.

Lord Currie recommends these arrangements are overseen by an independent Single Source Regulations Office that would replace the existing Review Board to provide stronger oversight of both MOD and industry. This and other detailed recommendations are now subject to a public consultation across industry and government.",Public Consultation,Informational,Other,id25_136
137,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/technology-helps-recuperation-of-troops--2,News story,Technology helps recuperation of troops,New technology is helping to advance the recuperation of injured Service personnel at Tedworth House.,Ministry of Defence,14 March 2012,"Cutting-edge gadgetry has long been a preoccupation of British Army soldiers committed to an impressive performance on operations.

But a Personnel Recovery and Assessment Centre is showing how technological advancements can also enhance troops’ fortunes far away from the battlefield.

Tedworth House in Wiltshire has been open to servicemen and women for six months and already its state-of-the-art surroundings have helped to change 150 young lives.

On a recent visit to the Help-for-Heroes-funded facility, the charity’s co-founder Bryn Parry explained how its success working with sick and injured personnel was in no small part down to the varied array of gizmos behind its doors:

Most people that come here go ‘wow’ and all the time it is technology backing us up,” he explained. “We now have the most sophisticated structure in the area.

Inside the Tidworth-based listed building some 6,300 miles (10,000km) of IT cabling can be found.

Among the televisions, DVD players and music systems common to most residential centres, this extensive network also serves a computer suite, extensive Wi-Fi access, a gaming area and an array of fitness equipment adapted for use by those with various disabilities.

Ex-soldier Dan O'Callaghan regularly works out on the centre's specialist gym equipment  [Picture: Steve Dock, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]

Later this year the £20m facility will open one of the most sophisticated gym complexes in the UK - the Phoenix Centre.

Kit there will include a £120,000 Skiplex indoor simulated ski slope, the second of its type in the country, and a SwimEx resistance pool.

Existing gear, such as the zero-gravity treadmill, will also be moved to the new room to improve residents’ confidence in adapting to their injuries.

Martin Colclough oversees the Phoenix programme which supports Battle Back, the MOD’s adaptive sports and adventurous training initiative:

[Our work] is about capitalising on technological advances to get the best benefit,” he explained. “We have bespoke, specialist equipment and although we started out with quite a small area for strength and conditioning we now need to space out.

Unlike the adaptive kit used at Headley Court, this is about preparing our troops to use the gear they will find back in civvy life.

With the imminent opening of the west wing later this year, Tedworth House will be at full operating capacity and able to accommodate a total of 54 residents.

Rifleman Billy Brumfield of 4th Battalion The Rifles was one of those who moved in last year:

I started doing courses and getting fit in the gym and it’s amazing,” he said. “The Phoenix Centre will be great too. There is nothing I am having trouble with that this place can’t help. You name it, they have covered it.

Other well-thought-out technology at the House includes panic alarms, cash-free food and drink top-up cards that can locate residents in an emergency, and a store of laptops and cameras that personnel can borrow to gain new skills in IT or photography.

Skype and video conferencing facilities allow guests to keep in touch with friends and family during their time away from home and Bluetooth-enabled laptops mean deaf visitors can follow a course instructor’s words in text on their computer screens.

Lance Corporal Colin Stephenson of the Intelligence Corps, who was injured by an IED in Afghanistan last year, said Tedworth’s technology was ‘opening doors’ for him and other servicemen and women:

I would definitely recommend that people come and give this place a go and arrive with an open mind,” he explained. “It builds confidence.

While the centre’s exciting facilities are helping troops to become more self-assured in living with their injuries and gaining new skills, camaraderie is often the most uplifting experience of a stay there.

The Officer Commanding, Major Peter Smith, explained:

One of the things we have learnt during our first six months is that sometimes the guys just want to sit and talk and get things off their chest.

And with state-of-the-art surroundings likely to impress technology-crazy British soldiers of any rank, this centre’s ambition to improve the lives of all who come through its doors is already being realised.",State-of-the-art facilities and equipment,Administrative,,id25_137

He added that the operation has shown the utility of high-tech platforms such as Typhoon, and high-precision weaponry such as Brimstone.

On Defence as a whole, Mr Hammond said that the Ministry of Defence is one of the most important departments of government, and also one of the most complex and challenging:

But I know I will be working with the bravest, most selfless and professional people the country has to offer - the men and women of our Armed Forces,” he said.

And they are supported by some of the most dedicated people in the public service, the most highly skilled workforces in British industry and some of the most committed people in the charitable sector.

He added that his first engagement as Defence Secretary at Royal Wootton Bassett reinforced just how important the Armed Forces are to the public and just how important the support of the public is to the Armed Forces.

On the wider defence environment the Defence Secretary said that this is a difficult time for the country, and for Defence in particular:

We are dealing with the toughest economic climate in a generation and the biggest budget deficit in our peacetime history. Against that backdrop, in Defence, we have also to deal with the legacy of an unaffordable equipment programme and a decade of operations at a continuously high tempo.

We do so at a time when the threats to our national security and our national interests are evolving fast - and by no means diminishing. And at a time when our Armed Forces, including a substantial number of reservists, remain engaged in a dangerous and enduring mission in Afghanistan.

Mr Hammond described the mission in Afghanistan as a vital operation to protect our national security and said he would make it a priority to get out to theatre to visit the troops as soon as possible.

He said that the first focus of Defence must be the delivery of success on operations:

The projection of military power is, after all, the raison d’etre of the Armed Forces and the MOD; everything else is a supporting role.

The Defence Secretary said that it was his firm belief that when the Government asks the men and women of the Armed Forces to put themselves in danger in pursuit of national security, the Government owes it to them to make sure they are properly supported and have the best tools we can give them to do the job:

In Defence, we now have a clear programme to deliver on this pledge,” he said.

The Armed Forces that will emerge from the implementation of the Strategic Defence and Security Review will be formidable, flexible and adaptable, structured to defend the country and project power abroad, equipped with some of the best and most advanced technology in the world.

This is not a vision of retrenchment, it is an ambitious programme of renewal after a decade of continuous operations - a blueprint for a sustainable future as one of the world’s most capable fighting forces.

Speaking about the anniversary of the publication of the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR), Mr Hammond acknowledged that it had been a year of difficult decisions, but outlined what his approach to competing demands would be:

I am determined that we neither compromise current operations nor constrain future defence capability, that we do not remove critical skills and capabilities that are irrecoverable, and that we retain the ability to scale up in the future if our national security demands it,” he said.

I intend to be a strong and passionate advocate for our Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defence both within government and with the public. I will advance the interests of Defence and national security at every opportunity.

However, Mr Hammond said that first class Armed Forces depended on a first class economy and there is no future for a big military supported by a small economy:

History is littered with examples showing that to be a fast track way to a collapse in global influence and military capability,” he said.

He said that Future Force 2020, the reshaping of the Armed Forces, must be built on firm foundations with a force structure that is fit for the challenges of future warfare and the real-world risks we are likely to face.

Adding that it must be a defence programme that is affordable now and sustainable into the future:

Unpicking the SDSR piece by piece is simply not an option. The transformation programme is essential to balance our books and modernise our organisation.

I am clear that this is the only way to ensure success on operations and the continued ability to project military power.

Mr Hammond concluded by reaffirming his belief that the men and women of the Armed Forces are the greatest asset Defence has and that, during his tenure in office, the commitment to rebuild the Armed Forces Covenant will continue:

This will mean all of us working together - Government at all levels working together with charities and the private sector - to look after our serving personnel and their families, and our veterans.

He said that there remains a big challenge ahead but the Armed Forces deserve no less than success.

Rt Hon Victoria Prentis KC MP selected Mr Parkinson following an open and transparent competition. It is expected that he will take up the appointment from 1 November for an initial term of five years. He will succeed the outgoing DPP, Max Hill KC.

The Attorney General Rt Hon Victoria Prentis KC MP said:

Stephen Parkinson brings a unique combination of legal expertise and public service at the highest levels, demonstrated most recently as Senior Partner at law firm Kingsley Napley LLP, and having spent numerous years in three of the Law Officers’ Departments: the Attorney General’s Office, Treasury Solicitor’s Department and as a prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) itself.

Stephen has had a stellar legal career both in and outside of government as well as experience of both prosecuting and defending. Combining this with his extensive track record of leadership, I have every confidence he will be a collaborative director and a principled and independent chief prosecutor. The public will rightly expect nothing less.

He will build on the achievements of Max Hill to whom I am grateful. The role of DPP requires exceptional qualities of judgement and character. I am looking forward to working with the new Director.

The CPS prosecutes criminal cases that have been investigated by the police and other investigative organisations in England and Wales. The CPS is independent and makes its decisions independently of the police and government.

Mr Parkinson said:

I am delighted and honoured to be appointed as the next Director of Public Prosecutions. Both as a prosecutor and defender I have always strongly believed in the importance of the CPS in bringing to justice and prosecuting fairly those accused of crime.

I would like to pay tribute to the work that Max Hill has done leading the CPS successfully through the challenges of the Pandemic and setting a clear direction for the future. I look forward to building on his legacy.

A portion of the Works Group operated from the Lashkar Gah region of Helmand province working for the Provincial Reconstruction Team. Amongst them was first-time dad and military foreman Staff Sergeant Jim Stevens.

The Lashkar Gah team delivered over 100 projects during their tour, the most significant being the Helmand Road Plan which saw the design and construction of 1,050km of asphalt roads across the province.

The construction was carried out by local Afghan companies which created meaningful employment for Afghan people and helped towards the development and stability of Helmand.

Staff Sergeant Stevens was responsible for the delivery of 500 metres of road in the Helmand Road Plan. He deployed two weeks later than his colleagues so that he could be present at the birth of his first child, Isabelle:

I really expected to miss the birth,” he said. “So when my Commanding Officer said I could deploy a few weeks later so I could witness the birth I was extremely grateful. It also gave me a few extra days with my wife Jennifer.

Other major undertakings for the team were the design and construction of police stations, schools and medical facilities.

The majority of the Works Group were based at Camp Bastion and carried out a number of tasks which included infrastructure support to helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, land units and forward operating bases.

First-time dad Sapper Keith Marshall provided survey support to the Air and Land Cells based at Camp Bastion. He was home on rest and recuperation when his wife Aisling gave birth to their daughter, Katie. He said:

It was brilliant to get home to be there for the birth and spend the first few days with Aisling and Katie. I was so excited to get home at the end of the tour and see them both.

The Air Cell was involved in tasks such as project managing the installation of radar systems and instrument landing systems for the main runway at Camp Bastion.

The Land Cell was responsible for infrastructure within the main operating bases such as Camp Bastion. One of the key projects was the co-ordination of the construction of a large kitchen within Camp Bastion capable of providing three meals a day for approximately 4,000 personnel.

Another section of the team, known as the Tactical Infrastructure Cell, was responsible for the development of the forward operating bases. Their main purpose was to provide technical expertise on upgrading the condition of the bases. Typical upgrades have included installation of permanent power supplies, flushing toilets, hot showers, medical aid posts and dining facilities.

Officer Commanding 63 Works Group, Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Browse, said:

Report by Ian Carr.",Ministry of Defence,25 January 2011,"Without breaking step, Major Bayard Barron, officer in charge of B Company, 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment, introduces himself as we march towards the Mastiffs:

This is Afghanistan’s Helmand province, the most dangerous place - in the world.

Then, he added:

Major Barron has no idea what he is in for today, but then, he has no idea what he is in for any day! Is that the sort of tabloid crap you are here to write?

I assure him it’s not. I tell him that I’m here to look at provincial reconstruction. That seems to satisfy him, and earns me a ride in his Mastiff to go and see. Mind you, if I had been intent on writing a testosterone-filled piece about alpha males blasting their way through the badlands, I’ve found my man.

Based at Forward Operating Base Shawqat in Nad ‘Ali (South), in just three months the Royal Irish shredded the insurgents that had been controlling much of the area around the base, earning it the reputation of being a no-go area and the sobriquet the ‘Red Wedge’.

In the first two-and-a-half months of their tour there were 546 serious incidents, 93 per cent of which involved direct fire. It’s not like that now:

We haven’t had a small arms incident in the centre of our operational area for weeks,” says Major Barron.

We have created a secure space, now it’s time for the locals to step in and decide what they want to do with it.

The Major’s view is simple:

The days of ISAF throwing money around are over, and we need to make that clear. If someone says to me their irrigation ditch is blocked, I ask what would they do if we weren’t here?

Although trenchantly stated, the message the Major is keen to get across is this - it is time that the Afghan population understands that development is in their hands and must be done through their own government structures, with ISAF in a supporting role:

We have to persuade people to embraceGIRoA[Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan],” said Adrian Dubois, a lean ex-Para, now head of the District Stabilisation Team for the area.

Adrian is a stabilisation adviser deployed by the Stabilisation Unit which is jointly owned by the MOD, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development. His job is to liaise with the battle group, the district governor and the locals to put stabilisation plans into practice:

I could easily dip into my big wad of cash and build a school for anyone who asks for it, but that’s not the solution.” he said.

I’m constantly having to manage local expectation by putting the handbrake on to ensure that the Afghan Government is seen as the right route to get things done.

Building something solves nothing if the infrastructure isn’t there to support it:

If we opened a school tomorrow, would it be registered in the District Community Council plan, would there be teachers, is it feasible, are there enough children registered to make it viable?

The local government has drawn up sector plans based on seven main themes which include things such as security, agriculture and health. Having provided the security, Major Barron now feeds in ideas and information to the locals, and to Adrian to take forward the rest:

I look at those suggestions in the context ofGIRoAplans,” explained Adrian, “see if they are supported and consider the local legitimacy of what is being proposed.

His approach needs to be balanced. If there is something he can do that will address an area of real and urgent need he will fund it, and if needs be advise the government to rebalance their plans.

To help him make informed decisions, Adrian is supported by Captain Jaco Van Der Merwe, a Royal Engineer and the Military Stabilisation Support Team representative:

I am Adrian’s eyes and ears on the ground,” he said. “I gather infrastructure information, for example I know where the electricity supplies in the area are and what they can generate.

Today he and Adrian are getting out to look at development projects that Major Barron needs to discuss. As we wait for the vehicles, the Major and Adrian explain how things are these days in their backyard.

Adrian and the Major are the yin and yang of the development process, working closely to make things better. Clearly they have tremendous respect for each other, understand the other’s point of view and broadly agree about what needs to be done.

The main issue is pace of change:

At the pre-deployment stage we need to prepare incoming battle groups that this is a fast-meets-slow situation,” said Adrian. “For 12 months troops train hard to come here for six-month tours. They arrive adrenaline-fuelled. They are highly capable and keen to get on with it.

Their job is to create the security bubble as quickly as possible, and they want to see progress quickly, especially when they have worked as hard and fought as superbly as the Irish have done.

Bayard did what was considered impossible clearing out the Red Wedge. But the Afghans don’t fit our timescales, they are not just here on a six-month tour. Having sorted out security, we need to stop from time to time and letGIRoAcatch up.

In recently cleared areas, local co-operation can last only until the next round of intimidation occurs, but here the Royal Irish have maintained the security bubble, giving the locals, for the first time in years, a chance to discuss what they want for the future. Major Barron describes this as a positive challenge:

When we talk to the people the first thing they ask for is security, we’ve given them that, then it’s ‘we want a school’. All the kids want to be interpreters or doctors. The thing is, if they want a school they have to understand that they have to lobby their District Community Council, get it in the plan, get it properly resourced through the Department of Education.

Both men feel the message is filtering through, but they sympathise, up to a point, with those who feel the need to get whatever they can from their benefactors.

Maybe, in the early days, in an effort to win hearts and minds, ISAF largesse may have created a culture of ask and it will be given. And in an area that has known 30 years of war, the wise man soon learns to get what he can while it’s on offer because tomorrow the well may run dry, or you might be dead. So impressing people thatGIRoAis how to get things done requires understanding and patience.

Long-term success depends on the careful nurturing of relationships and the development of trust with the locals.

For Adrian, that includes tempering the battle group’s natural urge to crack on while ensuring that sustainable progress is made. Then, having ‘tamed’ the Irish, although he would never put it that way, he will have to do the same again when they end their tour in April and another group of alpha males, the Royal Marines, arrive determined to make their mark.

Building up knowledge and an understanding of the area, who holds power, who can be trusted, is also crucial. Partly for this reason Adrian has signed up for a twelve-month tour instead of the usual six:

Bayard knows his operational area better than anyone else. He is absolutely brilliant at building relationships with both the good and the bad boys around here, and you have to be pragmatic,” said Adrian.

Some of them do have political aspirations and want to work with us to build government infrastructure. But Bayard will be going home in a couple of months, so I have to keep that impetus going.",Funding and Advice to Local Government Structures (GIRoA),Welfare,,id25_141

The 27-year-old was away from the Army for almost two years in her preparation for her Olympic bid. Capt Stanning and her rowing partner, Helen Glover, enjoyed fantastic support from the regiment who watched them go for gold on television in the mess at Roberts Barracks and thousands of miles away in Camp Bastion, Afghanistan.

Capt Stanning is now looking forward to her future career within the Army after securing Team GB’s much-awaited first gold:

I joined the military for a host of reasons and they all remain very strong; I love the guys I work with and the Army has a fantastic group of individuals,” she said.

As yet Capt Stanning is unsure what path her career will follow and she will have a long conversation with her desk officer to see what job she will be doing and what the Army requires of her:

I spent 18 months as a troop commander and carried out a big exercise in Canada and I have never been on tour and there are lots of other things I have not done yet,” said Capt Stanning.

It is of particular importance to the MOD as the UK National Security Strategy 2010 recognises that under some circumstances climate change and resource scarcity increases the likelihood of conflict, instability and state failure.

Climate change is affecting the environments in which our Armed Forces operate whilst resource depletion is increasing competition for critical resources (including fossil fuels) and may result in capabilities becoming unsupportable and/or unaffordable.

To address the military and operational risks posed by climate change and energy security, everyone in MOD and the Defence Sector needs to understand the operational effectiveness challenges and work to provide sustainable through-life operational capabilities.

This includes addressing estate and equipment performance to maximise through-life energy efficiency, reducing our dependence on fossil fuels, exploiting alternative energy technologies, and embracing innovative approaches to the delivery of capability.

This starts at the MOD strategic planning and capability planning stages and continues all the way to disposal of our capabilities.

It also includes our behaviours, equipment use patterns and decision making. Embedding sustainable thinking, design and behaviours through-life will assist in making the MOD more resilient to future economic, social and environmental conditions and achieve maximum operational effect and through-life cost effectiveness.

For instance, if we can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels on operations, we reduce operational and energy security risks due to interdiction of theatre fuel delivery, and through-life capability operating costs.

Analysis indicates that delivering fuel out to the remotest locations in theatre can be between two and ten times the cost of the ‘pump price’; this does not include the human cost we pay to fuel our forces in theatre.

Reducing fossil fuel use also contributes to reducing the MOD’s global carbon footprint, balancing this with operational need.

Sustainability is fundamental to ensuring that defence capabilities are able to operate in a variety of changing environments without reliance on ever more scarce and expensive resources, including energy.

It is important, therefore, that sustainability is addressed during all stages of the acquisition process and in our day-to-day activities and behaviours.",Sustainability considerations integrated into the acquisition process and day-to-day activities and behaviours.,Other,Informational,id25_143

The Operational Captaincy check, which involved ground- and air-based practical tests spread over a two-day period, is the culmination of nearly two years of flying experience and study on C Flight, since he joined 22 Squadron based at RAF Valley in Anglesey.

The airborne test scenarios involved a search for a yacht in trouble, followed by a search for people in the water. Prince William and his crew then had to put a simulated fire out on a large survey vessel before being tasked to search for two missing kayakers.

One of the ‘dummy’ kayakers had to be rushed to hospital with the winchman conducting mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and a cardiac massage en route.

With the airborne tests successfully completed, Flight Lieutenant Wales and his crew were then called out for a real-life rescue operation where a rig worker with chest pains was transferred from 30 miles (48km) off the Lancashire coast to Blackpool Hospital.

The event will begin with a spectacular flypast of RAF Typhoons over Windsor Castle in a ‘Diamond Nine’ formation followed by a parade through the Castle by more than 2,500 Service personnel from the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force.

The troops will muster in front of Her Majesty The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, as well as 3,000 military personnel, their families and veterans.

The event will close with a spectacular tri-Service flypast of 78 aircraft heading up the Long Walk and over the Castle, including helicopters, the famous Lancaster and Spitfires of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, Hercules, VC10 and Tornado aircraft, Hawks and Tucanos, and finishing with the world-famous Red Arrows.

In order to ensure the high standard expected of our Forces is maintained, all those involved have been hard at work practising so their performances on the day are perfect.

After providing over 130 horses and men for the State Opening of Parliament, the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment has had to move 80 horses and men to Windsor for the pageant.

Riding alongside mounted groups from all over the world, the Queen’s personal mounted bodyguard will take centre stage as Her Majesty’s Escort in the arena spectacular in Windsor Great Park.

A Captain’s Escort of 53 men and horses will be used to escort Her Majesty from Windsor Castle to the showground. A 25-strong division of Blues and Royals will ride in front of the carriage with a Life Guards division riding behind.

In addition to the escort troops, the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment will also be providing musical accompaniment in the form of the Mounted Band of the Life Guards.

This will consist of 26 musicians on their distinctive mixture of grey horses and cavalry blacks, and the famous drum horse Achilles - a personal favourite of the Queen.

Captain Charlie FitzRoy, the Blues and Royals Division Commander, said:

It is a great privilege to be able to represent the very best of British during this special year in our nation’s capital.

Of course, the workload is intense and the turnaround from one parade to another is very quick, but we are armoured combat troops and we are all used to this sort of tempo on operations.

Hundreds of Royal Naval personnel converged at Longmoor Training Camp in Hampshire for two-and-a-half days this week to practise their marching for the prestigious event.

Many of the personnel taking part have recently returned from operations in Afghanistan as well as from off the coast of Libya last year during Operation ELLAMY.

Lieutenant Richard Farrow deployed to Libya as the Logistics Officer on board Trafalgar Class submarine HMS Turbulent.

He said:

It was an amazing experience and one that people join the Royal Navy to take part in.

Watching the explosions in Tripoli through the periscope of the submarine was particularly memorable as was being part of a campaign to liberate the people of Libya.

This is clearly very different to what I was doing last year but I am very proud to be at the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations; it is an honour.

In addition, 500 Royal Air Force personnel from stations throughout the UK gathered at RAF Halton in Buckinghamshire to also rehearse their marching routines.

Drill instructor Sergeant Jono Atherton, charged with putting the troops through their paces ahead of the big day, said:

Bringing together staff from across the RAF it is our task to turn them into a smartly turned out team, ready to join their sister Services on parade.

We are striving for excellence, arm swings and steps all together.

New to the RAF, Aircraftman Stefan Connor starts training as an aerospace systems operator at RAF Boulmer next week straight after the parade on Saturday.

The Pembrokeshire Coast Path crosses the range - meaning people could not access it during live firing. However, the new 5.5 mile (9km) Castlemartin Range Trail now provides an alternative route for ramblers, cyclists and horse riders to move around the range boundary.

Funded by the Welsh Assembly Government (WAG), the Trail forms the latest section on the Wales Coast Path and brings a step closer WAG’s goal of creating a coastal path that spans the entire Welsh coast by 2012.

Users are not prevented from continuing their ‘coastal’ walk by firing activity and can still enjoy some spectacular views of the area - thanks to a marked route, access gates and fencing.

Commander Defence Training Estate Wales & West Midlands Colonel Richard Howard-Gash said:

Supporting our Armed Forces is the top priority for Defence Estates and training areas, such as Castlemartin, are vital elements in helping our troops prepare for operations in Afghanistan.

The Castlemartin Range Trail allows us to balance the pressing need for military training with the desire of walkers, cyclists, horse riders and others to enjoy this area of spectacular beauty.

We are committed to enabling members of the public to enjoy areas of natural beauty which form part of military training facilities, such as Castlemartin.

The Trail was recently opened by Welsh Environment Minister, Jane Davidson who joined walkers, cyclists and horse riders in trying out the route.

The project was set up around three years ago and Defence Estates worked in partnership with WAG, Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) and the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority (PCNPA) to create the route.

Castlemartin Range covers an area of 2,400 hectares within the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park and contains a wide variety of plants and wildlife. It has some of the finest limestone coastal scenery in the National Park.

Spectacular sea-cliffs host the largest concentration of breeding seabirds on the Welsh mainland.

It could have been so different, but for an accident of birth. Men born after 1927 were too young to serve in the Second World War. They inherited a secure peacetime Britain keen to forget the nightmare of Hitler. For those born earlier, fate offered a very different prospect - total war against the Nazis.

Beetham’s birth date set a trajectory that propelled him into the heart of the European maelstrom.

Before the age of 21 he had completed a tour as a Lancaster pilot with Bomber Command which earned him the Distinguished Flying Cross before he was even able to drive a car.

Nearly four decades later, as Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Beetham, and the most senior officer in the RAF, he masterminded the legendary Vulcan raid on Stanley in the Falkland Islands. It was a mission that succeeded against the odds and turned the tide of the conflict - dealing a demoralising blow to the Argentinian forces. However, he admits that had he been born later he would probably have become a Home Counties solicitor with a penchant for golf.

Born in London in 1923, Beetham’s outstanding RAF career began in 1941.

He initially trained in the United States before joining 50 Squadron in 1943 - just in time to take part in the Battle of Berlin.

Further Lancaster tours followed, and, having completed Staff College in 1953, he was posted to the Air Ministry where he was involved in the development of the PR variants of the Canberra and the introduction into service of the new V-bombers.

His presence at the nuclear trials at Maralinga in Australia where he witnessed four atomic detonations affected him profoundly. He came to believe that it would never be practicable to impose limits on a nuclear war.

Beetham was then given command of 214 Squadron at RAF Marham, equipped with the Valiant, with the task of developing the RAF’s air-to-air refuelling capability, and this culminated in 1959 when he flew the first non-stop flight from the UK to Cape Town in a record-breaking time of less than 11.5 hours. This, and his other long-range flights, provided a convincing demonstration of the feasibility and the potential of air-to-air refuelling for which he was awarded the Air Force Cross.

He then served at the heart of Bomber Command’s affairs when the world teetered on the brink of nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.

In 1964 Beetham was given command of the strategically important base of Khormaksar in the Middle East, the RAF’s biggest overseas station, at the time terrorists launched attacks against British forces in Aden.

More senior appointments followed, including Commandant of the Staff College, before he took up a NATO appointment at SHAPE in Belgium as Assistant Chief of Staff (Plans & Policy) - the first British officer to hold the post.

His return home in 1975, as Deputy Commander-in-Chief Strike Command, was short-lived as he was soon appointed Commander Second Allied Tactical Air Force and Commander-in-Chief RAF Germany.

Already conversant with much of the situation in Germany from his earlier days at SHAPE, he was now in charge of one of NATO’s main air forces.

The highest accolade came in 1977 when Sir Michael was appointed Chief of the Air Staff (CAS).  Recognising that recent heavy cuts had seriously impaired morale he had to address the problems of pay, which were seriously hindering recruitment and causing an exodus of skilled people.

Another challenge followed after the election of the Thatcher Government in 1979 and its first major defence review.

While these and other major issues, such as the purchase of Trident and the deployment of Cruise missiles, were being debated at the highest level, there were many RAF matters requiring his attention, such as the introduction of Tornado, which he had to defend against much unjustified criticism during its early days.

Air defence, too, was still far from satisfactory and the purchase of the Chinook and the stretching of the Hercules were amongst other important measures.

By 1982 he was preparing to hand over as CAS when Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands and, as Acting Chief of the Defence Staff, he was immediately involved in the decision to send the Task Force into battle. After victory in the Falklands, Sir Michael handed over as CAS and was appointed Marshal of the Royal Air Force.

From his home in Norfolk he has continued to work tirelessly for many organisations, specifically the RAF Museum, and, as President of the Bomber Command Association, he continues to lead the campaign for the Bomber Command Memorial in London.

The survival training is designed to replicate an operational scenario as closely as possible. The pilots are initially pulled through the water by boat to imitate wind inflating their parachutes and dragging them through the sea.

Once they have disconnected themselves, they must retrieve their personal survival pack and practise deploying and boarding their life rafts. They then use a sea anchor to prevent their life raft from drifting on the current.

If an operational situation forces a pilot to eject, their personal survival pack stays attached to them after they separate from their ejector seat.

The pilots are equipped with personal locator beacons to alert rescue services to their position and their survival packs are designed to provide necessary equipment to keep them alive as they wait for rescue craft to reach them.

As well as a life raft and buoyancy chamber, the packs include drinking water, a first aid kit and other useful tools. The survival packs are adapted for the conditions and temperatures that the pilots are operating in at the time.

The final stage of the drills is for the ‘downed’ pilot to be rescued either by helicopter or by boat. This element allows for RAF winchmen and RNLI personnel to put their skills to the test in safely retrieving the pilots from the water.

The RAF Leuchars Senior Medical Officer also attended the training and was able to share his insights with the RNLI crews as to the kind of injuries that a pilot might sustain as a result of ejecting and landing in the sea.

Squadron Leader Paul O’Grady, a pilot on 6 Squadron, said of the sea drills:

As front line Typhoon pilots we are involved in a variety of different tasks from our number one priority, Quick Reaction Alert in defence of sovereign territory, to advanced training exercises, ensuring that our combat skills are kept to the highest levels required.

The majority of our flying in the UK is conducted over the North Sea where we have the use of large expanses of airspace and are able to freely manoeuvre with minimum impact on the local community and civilian airline traffic.

As an expeditionary air force, we are always ready to deploy anywhere in the world at short notice; this again is likely to involve flying routes that may have extended sea tracks, so it is critical that our post-ejection training is regularly practised to increase our chances of survival should an incident occur and we are forced to eject.

We are always extremely grateful to the RAF Search and Rescue crews and RNLI personnel that assist us with our training and help ensure that we are thoroughly prepared for all eventualities.

RAF Leuchars in Fife is primarily responsible for maintaining Quick Reaction Alert (Interceptor) North, providing crews and aircraft at high states of readiness 24-hours-a-day, 365-days-a-year, to police UK airspace and to intercept unidentified aircraft.","The training, which fast jet pilots must undergo every two years",Administrative,,id25_148

Known as Exercise Poseidon, the Black Sea operation saw the group joined by ships of both the Romanian and Bulgarian navies.

Taking command of the group was a chance for the Commanding Officer of HMS Blyth, Lieutenant Commander Tim Davey, and his team to maintain their fighting and warfare capabilities and work closely with allies.

Throughout the exercise the crews swapped members, allowing each of the navies to share their knowledge and culture, building on international relations:

It is a huge privilege to assume tactical command of such a capable force,” said Lt Cdr Davey.

We are looking forward to maximising the training opportunities with our NATO colleagues.

While in the area the ships visited Varna in Bulgaria and Constanta in Romania, strengthening ties in the region.

The exercise, although primarily about minehunting, also involved the task group coming under simulated attack by Romanian MiG-21 aircraft. The ships successfully saw off the mock attack before moving on to a joint search and rescue operation involving a human dummy being dropped from 100 feet (30m) by a Romanian military helicopter.

After conducting a careful search pattern it was HMS Blyth that spotted the dummy and successfully rescued it.

Next up for HMS Blyth and the group was a transit into Mediterranean waters to Izmir in Turkey. Here the task group bade farewell to one another, before Blyth negotiated the Corinth Canal on her way to the south of France.

There is little doubt across the alliance that this key contribution has proven to be of immense value protecting civilians in Misurata and has helped Opposition forces to defend themselves against this brutal regime there. This is further strengthened by Italy’s recent announcement of additional air to ground attack capability.

We have seen significant progress made in the last 72 hours with Gaddafi’s forces losing their grip on Misurata and we have received reports of under-age soldiers and foreign mercenaries being captured — this underlines the regimes inability to rely on its own security forces.

The soldiers marched from Wellington Barracks, down Birdcage Walk, through Parliament Square, and finally through the Carriage Gates into the House of Commons, led by the Band of the Queen’s Division.

11 Light Brigade was deployed to Afghanistan from October 2009 to April 2010.

Speaking as the soldiers prepared to march, Minister for International Security Strategy, Gerald Howarth, said:

This is an opportunity for Parliament to welcome back 11 Brigade following their six-month tour of operations in Afghanistan.

It is a relatively new idea but one that was invented by James Gray MP who thought it would be appropriate for Parliament to make a public tribute on behalf of the British people.

We are all extremely conscious that while we have the joy of celebrating the return of those 120 who are here today, representing the rest of the brigade of course; at the same time we mourn the loss of 61 who gave their lives for this cause in Afghanistan on behalf of our country.

The Commander of 11 Light Brigade, Brigadier James Cowan, added:

I pay tribute to the living but also those that have given their lives, and also to the wounded. But what I would really like to focus on is that their sacrifice has not been in vain because of what has been achieved.

I think it is very hard to come to terms with a death or an injury but I think it is slightly easier if you know that we are making very considerable progress in this campaign and the loved ones of those that have been killed can draw great comfort from that.

The units that formed 11 Light Brigade were involved in all aspects of the campaign in Afghanistan from ground-holding and patrolling to mentoring and air operations.

The key operation of the tour was Operation MOSHTARAK which was undertaken with Afghan and US allies to clear and hold population centres in southern Helmand.

Seen as a very successful operation, 11 Light Brigade left secure and clear areas for 4th Mechanized Brigade to take over the ‘building’ phase - increasing security and building civil institutions.

One soldier at yesterday’s event, Corporal Spiros Parry of 1st Battalion The Royal Welsh, was one of those that took part in Operation MOSHTARAK.

Based in Camp Bastion, Corporal Parry was part of an air assault asset conducting short and sharp operations where needed for up to ten days. Corporal Parry explained:

My job was the CO’s [Commanding Officer’s] signaller to report back to Bastion and talk to the companies out and about. Giving the CO all the operational awareness.

The hype for the operation was enormous. Even the rehearsals for it as we were working with the Afghans and the French and other nations so everybody had to be synched for it.

In our case Operation MOSHTARAK went very, very well. We hit the place running I think. We got there and got settled in very quick. In day two we were already taking part in shuras and talking to village elders and all that - getting amongst it.

Another of those marching yesterday was Staff Sergeant Jason McLoughlin of 28 Engineer Regiment. Operation HERRICK 11 was his second tour of Afghanistan and during the six months there he was based at Forward Operating Base Inkerman in Sangin and also took part in Operation MOSHTARAK, tasked with the construction of Forward Operating Bases and Patrol Bases (FOBs and PBs).

Staff Sergeant McLoughlin explained his role during the tour:

I was based in FOB Inkerman in Sangin for the first five months mainly doing construction and force support for the infantry - putting guys out on patrol, giving them means of explosive exit or entry into compounds if they required it.

We also built quite a lot of FOBs and PBs. We built PB Sugar and PB Sangar from scratch as well as a couple of outposts.

The primary role was to secure supply lines and put in the PBs along Route 611 which not only made freedom of movement better for ISAF troops but also made freedom of movement easier for locals.

This is my second tour of Afghanistan but this was completely different from my first tour in 2006. This time was totally different and as soon as you were outside the PB you were in contact with the insurgents - you just expected it to come.

You deal with it by doing a very quick risk assessment - calculating how quickly something needs to be built compared to the risk involved.

Staff Sergeant McLoughlin explained that the reception the troops have received ever since their return has been amazing and the honour of being invited to Parliament is just further evidence of the great support given to troops:

The reception since we got back has been fantastic. It started with all the families - even though it was one o’clock in the morning!” he said.

Today is great to get back with some of the guys we served with. Also it is always nice to be recognised and be thanked for your efforts.

Following their arrival at the Palace of Westminster the troops were offered guided tours around both houses by MPs and had a private reception in Westminster Hall.",Reception for returning soldiers,Other,,id25_152

Whenever we log on we carry our essential human nature with us. Like people, cyberspace has a dark side and it is already shaping our future security environment. The openness of our society, our connectedness with the wider world and our high-tech way of life, is a source of strength. But openness also brings vulnerability.

Threats do not just come from malicious viruses or organised criminals stealing people’s identity or money. Digital networks are now at the heart of our transport, power and communications systems, and our economy as a whole. This reliance brings the capacity for warfare to cyberspace.

The consequences of a well-planned, well-executed attack against our digital infrastructure could be catastrophic. In this way, a single networked laptop might be as effective a weapon as, say, a cruise missile.

The National Security Strategy identifies cyber attack in the top tier of risks to the UK over the next five years. An extra £650m has been allocated to create a National Cyber Security Programme to fund work across government in partnership with business and other experts to strengthen our understanding, our resilience and our defences.

Understanding is key. In the military sphere, whenever a new domain opens up, like air and space flight in the last century, the temptation is to devise wholly separate doctrines to address the new environment.

But we must remember that cyber crime, cyber terrorism, cyber espionage or cyber war are simply crime, terrorism, espionage or war by other means. Cyberspace adds a new dimension, but its use in warfare should be subject to the same strategic and tactical thought as existing means.

Action in cyberspace will form part of the future battlefield, but it will be integrated rather than separate, complementary rather than alternative. Suggestions that cyber weapons will replace traditional weaponry are fanciful to say the least. Cyber will be part of a continuum of tools with which to achieve military effect, both defensive and otherwise, and will be an integral part of our armoury.

That is why this will link into work being taken forward across government to ensure a comprehensive approach.

We need to be comprehensive, because cyberspace has specific characteristics that blur traditional boundaries. First, the technology is similar to that used by people going about their daily business. With nuclear or biological weapons, the technical threshold is high. With cyber, the finger hovering over the button could be anyone from a state to a student. Second, establishing who is behind any attack and its purpose is difficult, particularly where aggressive state-sponsored activity is undertaken through proxies. Third, there are no geographic barriers in cyberspace. An attack could originate from anywhere.

This is why, as Britain reinvigorates its national cyber security architecture, we need to do the same internationally. In an environment of cyber anarchy Britain would be more vulnerable. Cyberspace should be considered within a rules-based system just like the physical world. Existing international frameworks can be applied to cyberspace too - we don’t necessarily need to invent new laws.

Top of the list of the UK principles on activity in cyberspace is the need for governments to act proportionately and in accordance with national and international law. These principles should apply in the civilian and military sphere alike. There is a lot of work being done bilaterally and multilaterally to develop common understanding and common positions. But this work needs to be guided by discussion of how states should act in cyberspace.

Some argue that the difficulties involved in detecting and attributing cyber activity mean any international consensus would be worthless, so why bother trying? Others argue that the West has a technological advantage and shouldn’t tie itself down to multilateral policy. I disagree.

First, a new international consensus won’t extinguish threats but it will help manage them. Consensus would provide legitimacy for action. At the very least, dialogue seeking to reach a common understanding about how states should behave would crystallise where we have significant problems or form the basis for building trust, confidence and transparency. The conference, which William Hague announced the UK will host later this year, is an important step in this direction.

Second, it is inevitable that the West’s technological edge will be challenged as other countries, particularly China, rapidly develop modern economies, modern militaries and modern technologies. It would be foolish to assume the West can always dictate the pace and direction of cyber technology. Instead, we should act now to influence positively the evolution of behaviour in cyberspace.

The bottom line is this. There is no point hiding behind national strategies or constructing a mythical Maginot Line in cyberspace. We need to think and act internationally because cyberspace is international space and the rules that govern it will be international too.",National Cyber Security Programme,Institutional,,id25_153

The Secretary of State for Defence, Dr Liam Fox, said:

I am pleased to announce that Astute Class Submarine Hull 5 is to be named HMS Anson. She will join HMS Astute, HMS Ambush, HMS Artful and HMS Audacious.

The Astute Class submarines, which will progressively replace the Swiftsure and Trafalgar Classes from this year, are extremely sophisticated, deep-diving, high-speed submarines.

Displacing 7,400 tonnes and measuring 97 metres from bow to propulsor, they are significantly larger than their predecessors but need fewer crew to operate them.

They are capable of fulfilling a range of maritime military tasks undreamed of by the strategists of previous generations and combine qualities of stealth, endurance and flexibility which afford the submarines unparalleled freedom to operate worldwide.

Technically they are capable of circumnavigating the globe without surfacing and with the advance of nuclear technology they never need refuelling.

Regarding their capabilities, Dr Fox said:

The seven Astute Class boats planned for the Royal Navy are the most advanced attack submarines ordered by the Ministry of Defence, with improved firepower and communications, and the ability to operate stealthily for extended periods.

The crew also benefit from greatly improved accommodation and facilities. The boats will undertake a wide range of tasks in support of military operations worldwide, including deploying Tomahawk cruise missiles and intelligence-gathering.",Naming of HMS Anson,Other,,id25_154

While 3 PARA continue to play a key role in safeguarding this area and keeping insurgent activity at bay, a key part of their role is mentoring and training their Afghan counterparts.

When they cleared Naqilabad Kalay in November, Afghan troops were put at the forefront of the operation and given leadership responsibilities, under the mentorship of the Paras.

In the long term, it will be soldiers from the Afghan National Army and officers from the ANP who will keep the peace in Helmand, and steady recruitment is an essential element of success.

Lieutenant David Donnelly, 3 PARA spokesman, said:

From traditional war-fighting one month to recruiting police officers the next, this tour could not be more diverse for 3 PARA.

The challenges our men face are wide-ranging and not always what people would expect from the Army, but they approach every task with the level of professionalism that is expected of them.

Lieutenant Colonel David Eastman, spokesman for Task Force Helmand, said:

The Afghan National Police represent the future of security in Helmand’s urban areas and we are making great strides. Since opening a little over a year ago, the Helmand Police Training Centre has seen more than 2,000 officers graduate.

Recruitment is also a key effort, so we can ensure that communities are protected by their own people and can be confident of lasting security in the long term.

The squadron worked alongside Royal Tongan and US Marines to ensure that the base, with a population of 30,000 military and civilian personnel, remained safe and secure.

One of the most important tasks performed by the RAF Police at Camp Bastion is making sure that the high number of military and civilian convoys, which arrive at and depart from the base daily, present no threat.

This is achieved at the main entry point by a systematic series of checks and searches, each of which gives an increased level of assurance as the vehicle or pedestrian approaches the RAF Police position.

The RAF Police are also responsible for helping to provide security for the airfield at Camp Bastion from where aircraft depart to take part in operations all over Helmand province.

During their six-month tour, 2 TPS searched and processed an average of 13,500 personnel and 5,300 vehicles per month, utilising military arms and explosives search dogs.

Report by Leigh Hamilton.",Ministry of Defence,3 October 2011,"The latest Operational Honours and Awards List recognises service on operations in Afghanistan and national operations for the period 1 October 2010 to 31 March 2011. Of the 140 honours, three are posthumous.

16 individuals are being awarded a Military Cross (MC) which recognises exemplary gallantry during active operations against the enemy on land.

One of the recipients is Warrant Officer Class 2 (WO2) James Palmer, from the Royal Logistic Corps, who is being honoured for his actions while on operations in Afghanistan in December 2010.

During a patrol in Sangin, WO2 Palmer left the relative safety of his Husky vehicle to rescue an injured Afghan National Army (ANA) soldier who had dismounted a vehicle during an ambush.

Under fire, WO2 Palmer moved the casualty back to his vehicle and communicated with the rest of the ANA troops to facilitate the movement of the patrol out of danger.

WO2 Palmer said:

I’m overwhelmed, honoured and humbled to get this MC. Working with the ANA was a fantastic opportunity to see how they operate and I made some very good friends.

I mentored the Regimental Sergeant Major out there as well as the Transport Commander. The Afghans are very tribal and they don’t accept you straight away, so you have to work on that. If you’re experienced and you can tell them stories, they accept you and listen to you.

Sergeant Kaye Wilson from the Royal Army Veterinary Corps is one of 11 military personnel to be made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in these latest operational honours.

Sergeant Wilson is being recognised for her role as a high assurance search dog handler during her third tour of Afghanistan from September 2010 until March 2011.

Along with her Belgian Shepherd, Obama, who was 18 months old at the time, Sergeant Wilson was based in Nad ‘Ali (South) and the Gereshk area. The duo would move ahead of troops to investigate any area that a search team had deemed as a high threat.

On finding out about her MBE, Sergeant Wilson said:

It’s amazing. It’s a team effort and I feel very humble that I’m one of the team. I’m glad I’ve received it, partly on behalf of the high threat teams and on behalf of the other dog handlers that have done far greater things than myself.

My family are completely elated that I’m getting this honour.

Sergeant Wilson explained the importance of building a bond when working with a military dog:

It’s different working with a dog than it is with a human,” she said. “The dogs are highly strung and highly driven, so it’s not a relationship where the dog is cuddled.

It’s a working dog and is maintained as a working dog, but you do bond with the dogs as they provide a bit of normality when you’re in the middle of nowhere.

The dogs have no concept of danger, so they don’t know what they’re searching for. The only thing that may spook them is our reactions to things, so if we start running around they can sense that something’s going on.

I’m sharing this MBE with Obama,” she said.

Lieutenant Commander Pauline Aird from the Royal Navy is being honoured with the Queen’s Commendation for Valuable Service (QCVS) for her role in delivering operational safety models to commanders in Afghanistan so they can operate with maximum freedom, but within policy.

During her deployment in Afghanistan from July 2010 until January 2011, she spent half of her time in Bastion and the other half travelling around different forward operating bases across Helmand.

Lieutenant Commander Aird said being awarded a QCVS came as a pleasant shock:

It was a surprise and I am very pleased. It wasn’t expected. The tour gave me the chance to have some tri-Service experience which was absolutely fantastic.

It was a completely different experience to what I had done before as I was previously embedded in industry working with Thales and Babcock on the carrier design as I have a naval architecture background.

Flight Sergeant Mark Lean from the RAF is being awarded the Queen’s Commendation for Bravery for his actions during a dramatic rescue of a group of climbers who became stranded on Ben Nevis in December 2010.

In perilous weather conditions, Flight Sergeant Lean led his Search and Rescue team to recover the climbers from the ice-covered mountainside in the pitch-dark:

I feel honoured and I graciously accept this on behalf of my team. My family are very honoured as well,” he said.

There was a variety of circumstances that led to this particular incident to be difficult; lack of fuel, conditions on the ground, the dark, and the positions that the casualties had got themselves into.

During the visit to Tyrwhitt House Mr Cameron said:

It is a priority to do more to help the mental health issues that veterans in our country have. The fact is, for many people the mental scars that they have from the time they have served can actually be as serious as or sometimes even worse than the physical scars, and we need to take it much more seriously as a country.

So I’m delighted that we are announcing extra mental health nurses out in the community. We are also announcing a 24-hour helpline so that people can always get hold of help when they need it and also it’s important to stress that we are going to work with organisations like Combat Stress that do brilliantly in helping those who bear the mental scars from their service in our Armed Forces.

During his tour of the centre, Mr Cameron spoke to veterans taking part in various activities to help manage their conditions and helped a group making poppies for Remembrance Sunday.

Here he reflects on the battles, losses and progress he witnessed.",Ministry of Defence,28 February 2011,"As another set of grenades ripped through the fabric of the half-built hotel, I peered out from my nearby shelter, wondering how it would all end. The siege had kicked off just a couple of hours before, when the Taliban mounted a bold attempt to attack the home of Gulab Mangal, the Governor of Helmand province.

Six insurgents had occupied the four-storey construction site that overlooked the Governor’s compound in Lashkar Gah, Helmand’s capital, but no-one was aware of their presence until the leader of the Governor’s bodyguard, an old, Soviet-era mujahideen fighter, spotted one of them preparing a grenade-launcher and raised the alarm by opening fire.

That lit the touchpaper and the insurgents returned indiscriminate fire from every storey, seemingly intent on causing as much damage as they could with the short lives they had left. To the people of Lashkar Gah, each shot the cornered fighters fired was a brutal reminder of the very real threat the insurgency continued to pose to their future.

I had arrived in Afghanistan two months earlier. My one-year posting as the Deputy Commander of Task Force Helmand was to provide some continuity in an organisation where the norm [for British forces personnel] is to serve for six months.

My job bridged the worlds of the military task force, the civilian-led Provincial Reconstruction Team and the Afghan Government. It gave me a unique perspective on the events of 2010 in Helmand. It also meant that it fell to me to provide military advice to the Governor, especially when his house was under attack.

As a result, the moment I heard reports of insurgents in the hotel, I drove to the sound of the guns. It was 29 January 2010, my wedding anniversary. I remember thinking ‘Don’t mess this up because if the Taliban don’t kill me, my wife will’.

Thankfully, the Governor was away that day but his deputy, Abdul Sattar, and I surveyed the scene around the hotel. It looked like a wrecked multi-storey car park. Its floors were exposed to the elements - the building’s facades had not yet been built, except for the corners, which had been glazed but which were now scarred by panes smashed by gunfire.

The building was surrounded by Afghan forces. Every few minutes they exchanged fire with the insurgents. Sattar asked me what I thought he should do. I was concerned. Fighting in buildings is a notoriously difficult task - think Stalingrad - and this was one of the largest structures in Helmand.

At that time the Task Force was at full stretch, holding on to what we had in the rural areas, and it would take time to assemble a British assault force to clear the hotel.

I told Sattar that the Task Force could send reinforcements but not until much later. To my surprise, he acted with calm decisiveness. He summoned the provincial police and Afghan army commanders and ordered them to assault the hotel.

Within minutes, the fire from outside rose to a crescendo as lines of Afghan police and soldiers fought their way in. The insurgents responded with dozens of grenades, which they must have cached earlier throughout the building.

The Government forces were undeterred. Several were wounded - my four-man team acted as their first aid post - but within the hour they had killed all of the insurgents and regained control of the hotel. They were jubilant. I was relieved; for the first time since I arrived in Helmand, I glimpsed light at the end of the tunnel.

Back in December 2009, I had concerns over the direction of the campaign. Sure, the situation had improved since I had first started visiting the province in the years before, but I still could not see how we could get into a position where we could transition Helmand back to the Afghans without the insurgents then regaining the upper hand.

Task Force Helmand had done, and was continuing to do, a great job where it could, but the challenges it faced seemed insurmountable. I understood the strategy we were pursuing - to convince the local population to support their government, in effect to win their ‘vote’ in the equivalent of a violent general election campaign - but I did not think we had the resources to do the job or enough Afghan local leaders or security forces that were up to the task.

The success of the Afghan forces in the hotel siege started to change my opinion and by the end of a remarkable year my view was entirely transformed.

Before the hotel siege, the British-led Task Force Helmand held responsibility for the five key districts in Helmand, which contained most of Helmand’s population, but we simply did not have enough troops to secure the area for which we were responsible.

The Afghan Government’s writ was only effective in the district centres and the population enjoyed minimal freedom of movement between these towns. Large rural areas were under total control of the Taliban.

As Provincial Governor, Gulab Mangal was impressive - a politically astute man whose judgement and vision I came to respect - but I was unsure about the other officials in the province, particularly some of the district governors, a few of whom could neither read nor write.

More worryingly, the Afghan Police were, in the main, still perceived by the local population as being corrupt, untrained and predatory. In short, we did not have the resources to do the job and our Afghan partners seemed too weak to operate without us.

The success of the hotel siege revealed how the Afghan forces could operate independently and how the Governor was not the only effective government official in Helmand. As spring came, more fundamental changes occurred. The most important was a surge of international troops, primarily US Marines.

Our numbers doubled to over 25,000. This increase allowed us to mount a series of operations to push the insurgents further away from the population centres. We cleared village after village of insurgents. Where we cleared, we held. Where we held, we started to build. Slowly but irresistibly we started to win the population over.

First, we gained their confidence by outfighting the Taliban, and then we won their support by proving that their government could outgovern them.

Where we held a strong security presence for long enough to allow governance and development to take root, the local inhabitants gradually seemed to grow resistant to Taliban intimidation.

By the end of my tour, I was receiving visits from elders complaining that we had not yet cleared their village - an unthinkable conversation a year before.

As we pushed the Taliban out of more towns and villages, the insurgency became increasingly rural in nature. As a result, freedom of movement became a critical issue. There was little point in us securing the population centres if the people could not move freely between them.

We were not the first to recognise this truth; the Romans had been here before. Good roads bring communities together, improve access to markets and government services and allow military forces to move rapidly from one point to another.

It is also much harder to plant an improvised explosive device in an asphalt road than in a rough track. The value of roads was demonstrated to me in April when I opened a new road we had built in the Babaji area.

When I had first arrived in Helmand, it had required a two-day fighting patrol to cover the distance that I drove along that day in just 20 minutes.

During my tour, I witnessed a profound improvement in the freedom of movement in Helmand. Roads that had been impassable became busy thoroughfares; new roads connected isolated communities with the main towns for the first time. Afghan Government officials began to drive to areas where once they could only visit safely courtesy of our helicopters.

Signs of progress in 2010 were not restricted to the actions of the international community. Our Afghan allies also improved significantly. The provincial governor instigated a wave of reform that saw many of the district governors replaced with far more effective officials.

Tribal strongmen were replaced with educated technocrats. I will never forget the gasp of amazement I heard from the elders of Sangin when their new district governor pulled out a notebook from his pocket in order to write down their complaints; his predecessor had been illiterate.

I also saw a significant improvement in the quality of the police force. A police academy was built and it started to churn out trained police officers - they were not perfect but they were good enough for communities to start asking for them to be posted to their villages.

It was, nevertheless, a bloody year. I far too frequently attended vigils for members of the Task Force killed in action; more than a hundred fell during my tour. Extraordinary acts of courage were commonplace. As we had gone on the offensive, the Taliban had fought back hard.

The number of incidents rose to unprecedented levels in the summer, the traditional fighting season in Helmand. However, even during this intense period, new trends were forming that gave us hope for the future.

Although the number of incidents was increasing, so was the distance that they occurred from the population centres. Major towns like Lashkar Gah became vibrant and peaceful places people wanted to live in. For the first time the Taliban seemed to come under real pressure.

We were removing their commanders from the field at a rate that was increasing exponentially. More importantly, by the end of 2010 it was more normal to see them respond to our actions rather than the other way round; we had at last seized the initiative.

Leaving Helmand, I felt it was in a far better state than when I had arrived. Much of course still hangs in the balance. There are still hard yards to be done. Northern Helmand, in particular, will remain a tough nut to crack. We will not really know how much we have weakened the insurgency until the main fighting season begins again next summer.

Much will also depend on the way the national political situation plays out in Kabul. I will continue to observe Helmand, but, from now on, it will be from my sitting room. And if I do visit a hotel for my next wedding anniversary, I hope to hear muzak rather than gunfire.

It has been a key weapon in the mission to enforce the UN resolutions to protect the Libyan people from violence inflicted by Gaddafi’s former regime.

Based at the Italian air base of Gioia del Colle in southern Italy, where the bulk of the RAF effort supporting Operation ELLAMY is located, the TIW has been analysing the images provided by the RAPTOR pods. This analysis is then used to brief commanders so that they have timely and detailed information with which to make critical operational decisions.

Group Captain Peter Squires, Commanding Officer of 906 Expeditionary Air Wing, explained why imagery captured by the RAPTOR pods has been so important in this campaign:

A major deficiency we have in this campaign is the lack of human intelligence on the ground. So we rely a lot more on imagery intelligence.

In addition to intelligence gathered from other NATO assets such as RAF Sentinel aircraft, the RAPTOR imagery is captured during sorties over Libya and then handed to the TIW after landing.

Sitting in their air-conditioned and electronically-sealed TARDIS (Tactical Air Reconnaissance Deployable Intelligence System), the small team of analysts pours over the imagery to discover how the battlefield is evolving and to identify any possible targets.

Acting Corporal Taz Hetherington of the TIW explained that they are often looking for one of four things - targets of opportunity, fuel queues, vehicle checkpoints and active engagements.

Any one of these can then be used to determine the current state of the battlefield and is passed on up the command chain to planners in the NATO Combined Air Operations Centre in Poggio, Italy.

RAPTOR captures imagery in a digital format and analysts such as Acting Corporal Hetherington can manipulate it to gather many types of information - for example, building height, distance, vehicle type and even traffic direction.

Just one of the examples of where the TIW has helped make a difference is the destruction of BM-21 truck-based multiple rocket launchers which have been used by pro-Gaddafi forces to target civilian areas in cities such as Misurata and Benghazi, to devastating effect.

Despite the pro-Gaddafi forces hiding the rocket launchers under tree canopies or buildings, the TIW team were still able to identify the weapons through these camouflages, enabling NATO planes to target them.",RAPTOR (Reconnaissance Airborne Pod for Tornado) intelligence-gathering system and the analysis of its imagery by the TIW.,Informational,Other,id25_160

The discussions yesterday covered a range of international political and security issues and highlighted the importance and strength of the deep and long-standing bilateral relationship between Australia and the UK and its capacity to address contemporary global and regional challenges.

Australia and the UK reaffirmed their commitment to working with the International Security Assistance Force to bring security and stability to Afghanistan.

The Joint Communique from the discussions also stated that Australia and the UK are committed to working together to promote global stability and prosperity and advance common interests related to bilateral strategic, defence, foreign and intelligence policy matters.

Australia and the UK welcomed reinvigoration of the bilateral strategic and defence relationship in response to the new challenges and threats generated by the changing international environment.

Both countries acknowledged that Australian and UK foreign, defence and security agencies needed to continue evolving to respond to contemporary challenges, and continue advancing our shared strategic interests.

While globalisation and interconnectedness bring new opportunities for growth and development, both countries recognised that new threats to the security of their citizens and their interests are also emerging.

Australia and the UK acknowledged the value of co-operating with other countries in assessing and addressing strategic and security challenges.

The communique also stated that Australia and the UK are committed to working together in concrete and practical ways to shape a more secure environment and advance common interests with respect to outer space and cyber security.

Intelligence co-operation between Australia and the UK is long-established and of high value. Exchanges on counter-proliferation and counter-terrorism are notably important at present, given their transnational character. Both countries agreed to maintain and build on the intelligence partnership.

Away from operations they capture the day-to-day events and high points of Army life, from parades to sporting achievements.

Amateur photographers, who fit their hobby around their day job of deployments and training, are also recognised for the high quality and creativity of their work.

See Related Links for a gallery of winning images from the Army Photographic Competition 2012.

Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Peter Wall, handed out prizes at the Imperial War Museum London, which holds an archive of Army photographs from the Second World War to the present day.

Winning entries on display at the prize-giving event included amateur and professional categories for best operational image, best portrait and best sport and adventure training image.

Army Professional Photographer of the Year, Staff Sergeant Mark Nesbit, said:

Having spent most of the last 12 months working with video, my stills portfolio isn’t as extensive as I would like but my camera and 50mm manual lens went everywhere with me looking for the opportunist shot. I am very happy to have been recognised for my photographic work.

Amateur Photographer of the Year Captain Dave Scammell’s interest in photography started when he deployed to Iraq in 2003 and found himself one of the few soldiers with a camera. He said:

Back then I did not really know what I was doing with the camera, it was only a little compact camera and the settings were always on automatic, but I knew what I wanted to portray in the images, it was just working out how.

This year when I heard I had won I was completely shocked as I really did not expect to win anything, but to win three out of four categories is truly unbelievable.

Categories and winners in the 2012 Army Photographic Competition are:

Warrant Officer Al Sylvester delivered a fascinating briefing about his recent expedition to Antarctica. He planned, organised and led the first military attempt to reach the South Pole unsupported almost exactly 100 years after the famous Scott of the Antarctic expedition.

WO Sylvester’s stories gripped the Saracens players as he described the training regimes and selection processes he developed to choose the final four mountaineers who would walk nearly 1,000 miles (1,600km) to the bottom of the world.

The tale was one of excitement, danger, fear and perseverance when faced with near unconquerable obstacles.

Dr Priestley said:

This was a great opportunity for the young players of Saracens to understand how mental strength is as powerful as physical strength, especially when facing adversities.

Al Sylvester’s experiences on the way to the South Pole emphasised characteristics such as pride, loyalty, teamwork, leadership, integrity, courage, commitment and professionalism; the same values we seek to develop in our players through the Player Development Programme.

Although the team did not manage to reach the South Pole due to a near fatal injury to one of the adventurers, WO Sylvester’s story was inspirational and provided food for thought for the players who were able to recognise the emotional power required to continue when everything appears to be against you:

It was an opportunity to share experiences and discuss how sometimes the battles are mental as well as physical, whether on the ice or the pitch. The parallels between rugby and mountaineering are clear,” WO Sylvester said.

The Saracens players clearly understood that, in a team sport, an individual’s actions, positive or negative, big or small, can have a disproportionate impact on the team’s performance,” he added.

The players later visited the First World War trenches built at RAF Halton to train soldiers before deploying to fight. Flight Lieutenant Andy Claesens provided an insight into the harsh conditions experienced by these young soldiers and the hardships of living and fighting in such conditions.

Drawn from Kent, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire and Bedfordshire, and aged between 16 and 21 years old, these young men fought side-by-side, with the bonds of friendship and their cap badge:

The parallels with rugby are clear,” said the Saracens’ Jared Saunders. “The guys who stood in these trenches almost 100 years ago were all about our age and came from the same areas that Saracens recruit.

They had a sense of pride in their cap badge and would do anything for their units and friends. We feel the same about the Saracens badge on our shirts.

The day was organised by Wing Commander Nick Robson who summed the visit up by identifying how members of the Armed Forces work hard together, both physically and mentally, to overcome hurdles, whether deployed on operations overseas or back in the UK:

The Royal Air Force are proud of our association with Saracens and continue to find opportunities to build on this relationship,” he said.",Player Development Programme,Welfare,,id25_163

Sailors who faced savage air attacks en route to the Mediterranean island were honoured at a ceremony in the island’s capital, Valletta, yesterday, Monday 13 August.

Malta’s Prime Minister, Lawrence Gonzi, unveiled a large black anchor as a symbol of the courage shown by the islanders and the convoy, known to the Maltese as the ‘Santa Marija Convoy’, that delivered vital supplies. He said:

On my behalf and on behalf of the Maltese people, I would like to thank the veterans here for their bravery which protected our island fortress in its darkest hours during the war.

The veterans - eight of the 100 still alive - were key players in Operation PEDESTAL, a dangerous wartime mission to relieve the starving people on the besieged island that were undergoing enemy bombardment.

More than 23,000 Royal Navy and merchant sailors sailed from Gibraltar during 11-15 August 1942 against an onslaught of 21 enemy submarines, 23 E-boats and 540 aircraft. More than 350 Service and merchantmen lost their lives.

In the operation, 14 merchant ships carrying supplies of aviation fuel and food were escorted by a Royal Navy fleet of four aircraft carriers, two battleships, 12 cruisers, 34 destroyers, submarines and Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships.

Only five of the original flotilla of merchant ships made it to Valletta - the most famous of which was the SS Ohio.

She had been bombed so heavily by enemy fighters that her back was broken and she was in danger of sinking. But she was supported into port by HMS Ledbury and HMS Penn on either side, with HMS Rye acting as a stabilser at the stern.

Despite the best efforts of the Italian and German attacks 30,000 tonnes of cargo reached the islanders, including aviation fuel for Spitfire aircraft based on the island. It sustained Malta for ten weeks and showed that the tide of the war in North Africa and the Mediterranean was not moving away from the Allies.

In 1942 John Suddaby from Warrington was a 19-year-old Petty Officer on the cruiser HMS Kenya, which was damaged when the engine room was bombed and caught fire.

Now 89, Mr Suddaby said:

Seeing the memorial means a lot in terms of what we went through, although it is very little in comparison to what the Maltese people here had to endure.

At the time it was just something I was told to do - I didn’t really realise the significance of it until afterwards but it was a tough couple of days.

I am extremely proud of what we did and it is important that it is remembered in this way.

Speaking at the ceremony in Valletta, the current First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, said:

We lost four warships, damaged five more, and out of 14 merchant ships only five got through - but they were a critical five and key to the survival of Malta.

The Navy was at sea, in the air and under the sea, because it was vital we got these supplies through.

Admiral Stanhope also praised Malta for supporting Libyan-bound forces last year and thanked the island for providing use of its Grand Harbour, where the memorial anchor now sits. The location meant that NATO ships, including HMS Cumberland and York, could enforce the United Nations resolutions which were important to the outcome of the conflict.

He added:

This visit was about making sure Malta feels valued for what it provided last year in support of operations off Libya. Their support was completely invaluable in that they provided berthing facilities and access to stores.",Recognition and Commemoration of Veterans' Service,Informational,"Other (Strategic Plans, Consultations)",id25_164

Here he writes about how the Taliban is losing the support of the local population.",Ministry of Defence,17 March 2011,"In Delta Company we have worked hard over the last six months to establish security and freedom of movement on Route 601. This is a vital route which connects the provincial capital and largest city in Helmand, Lashkar Gah, with the centre of commerce, Gereshk, and these cities in turn with the neighbouring province of Kandahar.

Kandahar City is the major city in southern Afghanistan and the key city in the Pashtun ethnic belt. As such, this route and our task have strategic implications for bringing normality and security to the day-to-day lives of the Afghans.

Throughout our tour we have been very aware of the problems with security and insurgent influence to the north and south of Route 601 which have remained while we have focussed primarily on the route itself.

A recent patrol by Delta Company and our Afghan Police partners took us to Alokozi Shah, an area south of the village of Popalzai, itself a few kilometres south of Route 601.

The patrol was relatively quiet throughout and the locals seemed very co-operative and happy to see us. It is such ‘atmospherics’ we look out for in any area we operate in, the response of the locals to our presence is a key indicator of how active the insurgency is in the area.

Corporal Jamie Williams [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]

I was reassured by the mood and took it as good a sign that our work in the surrounding areas providing security and driving out the insurgent fighters was having a positive effect.

After patrolling through several villages and stopping now and then to talk with locals, we stopped a car which was passing by, to get some more intelligence on who was moving through the area. This driver was Abdul Haji Shaz, an influential local businessman who owns a number of compounds and petrol stations in the area.

Abdul invited us to one of his nearby compounds where we were treated to the famous Pashtun hospitality in earnest and enjoyed chai, nuts and sweets. Abdul, who divides his time between business interests in Alokozi Shah and Lashkar Gah, told us his story.

Abdul Haji Shaz had moved away from Alokozi Shah some years ago because of constant insurgent control of the area. The insurgents had taxed heavily any crops that were grown and the locals had lived in constant fear of the harsh justice they imparted. He had taken his children to Lashkar Gah to give them a chance of a better life away from insurgent influence.

I asked Abdul why he was now back in the area. His response, which I had hoped for, was that he had returned in recent weeks because he had heard that security was much better than it had been and that British troops along with their Police partners had pushed the insurgents out of the area.

Abdul continued to describe how the talk of the area was of how much security had improved throughout the winter. Most promisingly, he told me that he was now planning to bring his family back to their old home. This I wrote down, word-for-word:

I have been hearing on the local radio about how good the security is and my brothers keep telling me this as well. I have now witnessed for myself that the area is much better. I have also heard about the plans for the new school and think that if the security continues to increase then it will be a great opportunity for our kids to get the proper education they deserve.

This, while only one of hundreds of encounters I have had with locals during my time in Helmand, was not an isolated incident in terms of the positive message I received. This stood out in my mind as an important meeting as Abdul is an influential local elder, respected and looked to for decisions and advice by hundreds of other villagers.

It is evident to me that the effect of the increased security and development which ISAF troops and our Afghan Police partners have fought hard to bring is now taking hold. The message is spreading that the Afghan government are the better option and the insurgency are losing the support which they need to survive.

If this momentum continues then more Afghans who desire a good life will return to the area and support the legitimate government and security forces in the area, denying the insurgents what they want the most, control of the population. This kind of encounter is now happening every day across Helmand and signals the turning of the tide in Afghanistan.

While stationed in the South Atlantic Overseas Territories, HMS York provided reassurance to the local people and acted as a deterrent. She also took part in a joint exercise with her affiliated Army regiment, the Yorkshire Regiment, members of the 1st Battalion of which (1 YORKS) were stationed on the islands.

The destroyer’s gun fired 100 rounds of high explosive ordnance in support of members of 1 YORKS during the exercise, some of the 1,000 rounds fired in total.

Several air defence exercises were also held with RAF Typhoon aircraft.

HMS York’s Commanding Officer, Commander Simon Staley, said:

The excellent training and support provided prior to our departure last year has stood York in very good stead for what has been a challenging and sometimes gruelling South Atlantic deployment.

Focused on our mission from the get go, my ship’s company has retained York’s outstanding strength throughout; they have been utterly professional, consistently resourceful, and determined to retain the sense of humour synonymous with the Senior Service.

On patrol in the extremis of the South Sandwich Islands, or when exercising with tri-Service colleagues and international partners in the littoral and on the high seas, Team York has succeeded on all counts.

As their Commanding Officer, I am immensely proud of these tenacious and loyal men and women and delighted to be returning them safely home to their friends and families.

While stationed in the Falkland Islands, HMS York worked alongside the on-station tanker, RFA Wave Ruler, to support an RAF helicopter rescue of an ill trawlerman, provided the Guard at the Queen’s Birthday Parade in Port Stanley, and was in the area when the exploratory oil rig, Ocean Guardian, arrived to begin the search for oil reserves.

Settlement visits were also held at Pebble Island, Port Edgar, Fox Bay and San Carlos, with memorial services conducted at the war grave sites of HM Ships Ardent, Antelope, Coventry and Sheffield.

HMS York also visited South Georgia and provided support to the British Antarctic Survey who are based there to assess the impact of climate change.

Stops at the stunning Drygalski Fjord and Gold Harbour and Grytviken provided excellent opportunities for the ship’s company to see some diverse wildlife. HMS York also took the rare opportunity to visit Southern Thule, part of the South Sandwich Islands, and the most southerly point, where they flew the White Ensign.

Chief Petty Officer Dennis Nolan said:

This is my last deployment as I will be shore-based from now until I retire in three years, and patrolling the South Atlantic has definitely seen me end that side of my career on a high.

It has been extremely challenging - especially working within the operational theatre of the Falkland Islands; we had to make sure that we did a decent job by providing a strong mixture of reassurance and deterrence.",Maintaining a naval presence and providing reassurance and deterrence in the South Atlantic.,Other (strategic plans),,id25_166

In all, about 16,000 sailors, soldiers and airmen from 15 nations, hosted by Norway, are taking part in Cold Response which tests the ability of NATO’s forces to fight in the harshest environment imaginable.

The ten-day war game has gathered an international task force in the waters of the Arctic.

The situation in the fictional ‘Nerthus’ region (actually northern Norway) is deteriorating, with ‘Gardarland’ refusing to withdraw its troops from neighbouring ‘Borgland’, and the multinational naval force on high alert, ready to intervene if needed.

During Cold Response HMS Illustrious is home to eight helicopters - four Sea Kings and four Lynx, all from Royal Naval Air Station Yeovilton.

The 900-plus crew of HMS Illustrious, including Royal Marines and personnel from the Commando Helicopter Force, are working around the clock.

Staff working on the flight deck, day and night, are facing blizzards and strong winds that can drop the temperature to minus 40 degrees Celsius as they marshal and refuel the essential helicopters.

At one point a blizzard brought flying operations to a standstill.

Royal Marines of Kilo Company, 42 Commando, had been ready to board Commando Helicopter Force Lynx and Sea Kings when the operation was called off.

Deck crews and aircraft maintainers coped with high winds and blizzard conditions to secure the aircraft to the deck or move them inside to a hangar.

Captain Martin Connell, the ship’s Commanding Officer, said:

HMS Illustrious and her embarked helicopter squadrons are certainly facing some tough arctic conditions.

But we have prepared for this, both in terms of training and with all our equipment, and I am very pleased with the way the crew have approached the exercise throughout the ship.

He added:

In particular the positive attitude and cheery enthusiasm of those operating on the flight deck have been vital and have allowed Illustrious to conduct helicopter operations round the clock in support of the multinational task force.

A few miles away, the Navy’s flagship HMS Bulwark has been carrying out amphibious exercises with her landing craft.

In order that the postal system doesn’t get clogged up by generous members of the public wishing to show their support for Service personnel overseas and that gifts and cards from loved ones get through in time, the Ministry of Defence is urging the public to consider donating to Service charities as an alternative way of showing their support, rather than sending parcels to troops overseas.

The kindness and generosity of individuals and groups who send boxes of treats out to operational theatres is greatly appreciated. However, the sheer volume of such mail delays the mail sent by family members and loved ones. In addition, the unintentional inclusion of inappropriate items causes serious difficulties for those charged with distributing all supplies, including post.

Head of the British Forces Post Office, Brigadier Russell Beattie, said:

All the staff throughout the British Forces Post Office network worldwide are focused on the particular challenges of getting personal mail through at Christmas.

This is of course particularly important where it concerns Service personnel deployed on operations, not least because of the often acute difficulties of reaching individuals in some very inaccessible locations.

Whilst the sentiment behind the public wishing to send welfare parcels is gratefully acknowledged it is far better that they donate to established Service charities as they can focus support directly to areas of greatest need.

The volume of mail arriving at Camp Bastion for onward distribution causes three problems:

personal mail sent to deployed personnel by their loved ones can become significantly delayed amidst all the other items from members of the public. Receiving a letter or a gift from a family member or loved one is very important for morale, and for the peace of mind of families back home. While unsolicited parcels are without doubt gratefully received, the delays they inevitably cause to the much more valued personal mail are considerably less welcome.

delivering goodwill parcels to forward operating bases needs additional helicopter resupply flights and road convoys which can place Service personnel at additional risk in what is already a difficult and dangerous operating environment. Every time an additional convoy is laid on, more troops are put at risk of enemy attack.

many of the items included in the public’s welfare parcels are either already readily available in theatre or are simply not appropriate for the Afghan environment, and therefore can go to waste.

The MOD has drawn up a list of recommended Service charities which accept public donations to assist deployed personnel and their families back at home.

Some of these funds send welfare parcels to Afghanistan, but they do so in consultation and partnership with the Armed Forces, and in a co-ordinated way which does not put undue pressure on resources.

The charity uk4u Thanks! is sending 22,000 Christmas Boxes to personnel serving around the world. One of the charity’s trustees, Sally Little, said:

uk4u Thanks! is very grateful for all the support we receive. Donations enable us to fund our Christmas Box campaign, with everyone serving overseas or in hospital over Christmas receiving a box of presents and treats. We make sure everyone receives their box, and it means a great deal to our servicemen and women knowing the public are thinking of them at this special time.

Recognised Service charities include:

In conjunction with the MOD, SSAFA launched the Operational Welfare Fund last year. Dedicated to providing support to the front line, the fund has so far raised over £38,000 of which over £31,000 has been spent following specific requests from operational theatres. Examples of purchases include Wii handsets, games consoles, table tennis tables, film projectors and portable DVD players.

Although the MOD provides a comprehensive Deployment Welfare Package which includes a free mail service, 30 minutes of telephone calls a week and internet access, there are still areas where life can be improved.

Priority for spending from the fund is set by commanders in theatre for those items which will have the most significant impact on enhancing the morale of their personnel.

uk4u Thanks! is a registered charity which provides Christmas Boxes full of presents (affectionately known as the ‘square stocking’) as a gift from the nation to all those serving in the Armed Forces overseas away from their families on Christmas Day. They ensure that all servicemen and women who are serving away at Christmas receive a box, whether they are in the Royal Navy, the Army or the Royal Air Force, and wherever they are in the world. Feedback from troops who have received the boxes since the charity began in 2004 has been extremely positive, and they are a significant boost to morale.

The charity does not receive any public funds, but the Ministry of Defence supports the charity with advice and guidance. They also help by sending the parcels for troops in any transport going out to operational theatres which has spare capacity. It is important that the boxes are not sent through the British Forces Post Office system so there is no chance that they will ‘clog up’ the supply chain and delay parcels from families and friends getting to their loved ones.

Support Our Soldiers is a tri-Service charity which allows the public to show their support for both members of the Armed Forces serving overseas and their families back home.

The founders of the charity are both mothers of soldiers keen to do something positive as a result of their personal experiences.

Support Our Soldiers has a bespoke arrangement with the British Forces Post Office to facilitate the sending of high quality parcels out to named Service personnel which is co-ordinated to ensure minimum disruption to the operational postal system.

Thank The Forces is a tri-Service charity which allows the public to show their support for members of the British Armed Forces serving overseas.

Thank The Forces has a bespoke arrangement with the British Forces Post Office to send an agreed quantity of parcels for troops out to each of the chaplains in theatre every week for onward distribution to where they will be most appreciated. The delivery of these parcels is also co-ordinated to ensure minimum disruption to the operational postal system.

Any monies raised in excess of that required for the parcels for troops is passed direct to the SSAFA Operational Welfare Fund.",The MOD has drawn up a list of recommended Service charities which accept public donations to assist deployed personnel and their families back at home.,Informational,,id25_168

Colonel Peter Rafferty, Team Leader for the Individual Capability Group at DE&S, said:

Reducing the burden on the dismounted solider is a priority. We work closely with our partners within Dstl, as well as in academia and industry, to identify and develop technologies which we think will meet this need, effectively turning today’s technology into tomorrow’s fielded equipment.

Dstl project lead, Ross Jones, said:

We’re having to look at novel ways to reduce weight; this includes researching materials not commonly used in defence, and advising industry and academia how the weight of equipment can be reduced.

Dstl’s scientists have done a lot of analysis focusing on the mix of equipment on the soldier, and what benefit they are getting for that weight.

On show was kit from an array of different organisations which could aid UK Armed Forces - from composite armour plating to new ways of reducing the size of cumbersome batteries, including woven fabrics which can hold an electric charge.

Also on display was a new unmanned ground vehicle and examples of how using different materials for assault rifles, ammunition and their clips can make big savings on weight.

Ross Jones continued:

The prototypes on display show that this project has been successful in identifying concepts which can reduce the weight of equipment while not reducing soldier capability.

We will continue to refine those concepts in collaboration with industry, academia and MOD colleagues, like DE&S, to ensure that UK troops continue to receive the best equipment to provide a technological edge.

Dstl military adviser, Lieutenant Colonel Toby Evans, said:

What we want is a systems approach to how a solider is equipped. Our equipment is highly effective when analysed individually, but what we want to improve is the way that equipment works together as a system and we’re working hard with industry and academia to ensure that happens.","Continued refinement of concepts in collaboration with industry, academia and MOD colleagues.",Other,,id25_169

The Home Secretary also announced more than half a billion pounds of additional central government funding for policing next year to support the government’s Safer Streets Mission, including an increase in the core grant for police forces, and extra resources for neighbourhood policing, the NCA and counter-terrorism. A full breakdown of the funding will be published as part of the police settlement in December.

In her speech, the Home Secretary said that without a major overhaul to increase public confidence, the British tradition of policing by consent will be in peril.

The reforms will restore community patrols with a Neighbourhood Policing Guarantee and an enhanced role for Police and Crime Commissioners to prevent crime. The changes will also ensure that policing has the national capabilities it needs to fight fast-changing, complex crimes which cut across police force boundaries.

This is part of a strategic reset in the relationship between government and policing, with the Home Office taking a more active role in working with policing leaders to drive improvements and ensure policing is set up to succeed rather than frustrated by weak national structures.

To drive excellence across policing, the Home Secretary and police system leaders will establish a new National Centre of Policing. While work is underway to determine the scope and scale of the unit, it is expected to include specialist and supportive functions like forensics, aviation and IT, which have become fragmented and underpowered over the last decade. National arrangements on procurement will also generate savings to reinvest into frontline policing.

A new Police Performance Framework will be drawn up between policing and the Home Office to make sure standards are upheld across the country. This meets a long-standing recommendation of the police inspectorate and has the support of the College of Policing and the National Police Chiefs’ Council.

This framework will be underpinned by a new Police Performance Unit in the Home Office, using data to determine force-level improvements and end the postcode lottery on standards.

The Home Office will create a new central database of high-quality force-level data tracking local performance in priority areas like knife crime and violence against women and girls. Ministers will work in collaboration with the College of Policing, His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services and PCCs to ensure there is effective intervention when forces are failing.

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said:

Public confidence is the bedrock of our British policing model but in recent years it has been badly eroded, as neighbourhood policing has been cut back and as outdated systems and structures have left the police struggling to keep up with a fast-changing criminal landscape.

That’s why we’re determined to rebuild neighbourhood policing, to improve performance across police forces and to ensure the highest standards are being upheld across the service.

The challenge of rebuilding public confidence is a shared one for government and policing. This is an opportunity for a fundamental reset in that relationship, and together we will embark on this roadmap for reform to regain the trust and support of the people we all serve and to reinvigorate the best of policing.

The reform agenda has the backing of police leaders, with the government committed to working in lockstep with them to rebuild trust between the police and the communities they serve. The work will be set out in a white paper, due to be published in the spring, ahead of legislation in due course.

Chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council Gavin Stephens said:

We’re encouraged to hear the Home Secretary’s plans for policing reform and look forward to working with government and our partner agencies to determine how best we can shape the future of our service.

At our joint summit with the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners this week, I’ll be giving more detail on our vision and ambitions, keeping communities at the heart of all that we do.

Chair of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners Emily Spurrell said:

We welcome the Home Secretary’s renewed focused on data and standards as part of reforms to provide a better service to the public. Not only will this help to shine a light on where there are issues of concern, but also highlight best practice.

Successful innovation often starts at a local level, led by Chief Constables and PCCs, before being taken up nationally. Identifying promising initiatives early and then working with policing to improve national take up will be greatly assisted by improved data. Likewise, where there are failings, the Home Office, PCCs, the College of Policing and the policing inspectorate should be working together using data to drive improvement and reassure the public.

We look forward to working with the government and policing colleagues to design a performance standards unit which helps policing deliver more effectively in an ever more complex environment.

Dr Rick Muir, Director of the Police Foundation, and Tom Gash, Managing Director of the public sector consultancy Leapwise are today publishing a joint report supporting the police reform agenda and setting out further reform options.

Dr Rick Muir, Director of the Police Foundation, said:

A serious reform programme like this in policing is long overdue.

Too often in the past, officers at the frontline have been let down by outdated technology, inadequate training and inefficient support services.

Until these issues are addressed, the public won’t get the quality of policing they deserve.",Additional central government funding for policing,Welfare,,id25_170

Energy Security Secretary Grant Shapps will today announce how Great British Nuclear (GBN) will drive the rapid expansion of new nuclear power plants in the UK at an unprecedented scale and pace. This will boost UK energy security, reduce dependence on volatile fossil fuel imports, create more affordable power and grow the economy, with the nuclear industryestimatedto generate around £6 billion for the UK economy.

From today, companies can register their interest withGBNto participate in a competition to secure funding support to develop their products. This could result in billions of pounds of public and private sector investment in small modular reactor (SMR) projects in the UK – demonstrating the government delivering on its priorities to partner with the nuclear industry and jointly spearhead the future of nuclear technologies.

Unlike conventional reactors that are built on site,SMRsare smaller, can be made in factories and could transform how power stations are built by making construction faster, and less expensive.

GBNwill play a key role in helping the government hit its ambition to provide up to a quarter of the UK’s electricity from homegrown nuclear energy by 2050 and achieve among the cheapest wholesale electricity prices in Europe, whilst supporting jobs across the country.

In addition to supporting this emerging, more agile technology, the government remains committed to the mega projects of Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C and will work withGBNto consider the potential role of further large gigawatt-scale nuclear power plants in the UK energy mix.

Energy Security Secretary Grant Shapps said:

Britain has a rich history as a pioneer of nuclear power, having launched the era of civil nuclear power - and I’m proud to be turbocharging its revival and placing our country once again at the forefront of global innovation.

By rapidly boosting our homegrown supply of nuclear and other clean, reliable, and abundant energy, we will drive down bills for British homes and make sure the UK is never held to energy ransom by tyrants like Putin.

Today, as we open Great British Nuclear and the competition to develop cutting-edge small modular reactor technology, which could result in billions of pounds of public and private sector investment, we are seeing the first brush strokes of our nuclear power renaissance to power up Britain and grow our economy for decades to come.

Minister for Nuclear Andrew Bowie said:

As long-standing pioneers of nuclear, today we’re marking its UK revival with the opening of Great British Nuclear, which will play an essential role in transforming the way we power Britain from Britain.

I look forward to seeing the world-class designs submitted from all around the world through the competitive selection process, as the UK takes its place front and centre in the global race to unleash a new generation of nuclear technology.

Simon Bowen, interim chair ofGBNsaid:

GBNis core to delivering the government’s new nuclear programme.

Building on the work done at Hinkley Point and Sizewell, today’s announcement of the start of theSMRselection process signifies a real step forward in delivering the scale of nuclear power that Britain needs for secure, sustainable energy future.

We look forward to working with all interested parties – technology vendors, the supply chain, the wider industry and local communities as we move this essential programme forward.

On top of today’sGBNcompetition launch, the government is also announcing today a grant funding package totalling up to £157 million:

Up to £77.1 million of funding for companies to accelerate advanced nuclear business development in the UK and support advanced nuclear designs to enter UK regulation, maximising the chance of small and advanced modular reactors being built during the next Parliament.

Up to £58 million funding for the further development and design of a type of advanced modular reactor (AMR) and next generation fuel.AMRsoperate at a higher temperature thanSMRsand as a result they could provide high temperature heat for hydrogen and other industrial uses alongside nuclear power. The winning projects of this latest phase of funding are:

A further £22.3 million from the Nuclear Fuel Fund will enable 8 projects to develop new fuel production and manufacturing capabilities in the UK, driving up energy security and supporting the global move away from Russian fuel. Winning projects include:

A knowledge sharing initiative, led by expert nuclear industry advisers Arup Ove, aimed at facilitating the sharing of valuable expertise to reduce the time, risk, and cost ofAMRR&Dprogramme delivery.

Julia Pyke, Joint Managing Director for Sizewell C said:

It’s great to see the growing ambition for nuclear which underlines the key role it will play in a future ‘net zero’ energy system. Today’s announcement is also another big vote of confidence in Sizewell C, which will continue the transformation in British nuclear construction started by Hinkley Point C.

If Hinkley had been on last year, UK consumers would have saved over £4 billion. Both projects will form a vital part of the future nuclear fleet, helping to lower carbon emissions and reduce energy costs for British households.

Tom Greatrex, Chief Executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said:

The launch ofGBNmarks a new era for nuclear deployment in the UK – helping drive a programme of construction at pace and at scale to strengthen our energy security, create good jobs across the country, and advance our net zero future by providing up to 25% of our future power needs.

Focus on theSMRselection will demonstrate the commitment to deployment of innovative technologies and open up new opportunities for the UK industrial supply chain here and abroad. There a range of sites and communities across the country ready to hostSMRtechnology, alongside the large scale nuclear capacity we will also need.

Britain has an important leadership role in the global nuclear industry, and nowhere more so than in our determination to drive Russia out of the nuclear fuel markets. The government’s Nuclear Fuel Fund will bolster those world-class capabilities that make us uniquely placed to help our allies replace Russian supplies with Western nuclear fuel.

David Peattie, Nuclear Decommissioning AuthorityCEO, said:

Decommissioning plays a critical role in the lifecycle of nuclear power generation, and we are committed to sharing our expertise, resource, and assets to supportGBNand the government in delivering for the British public.

I’m delighted that in support of this aim our nuclear transport arm, Nuclear Transport Solutions, has been awarded over £1 million of government funding to develop the fuel transport package for new nuclear reactors.

We will continue to explore opportunities to align our mission withGBN’s ambitions, including the potential to free up our excess land for other uses.

Last year, the government made the historic decision to revitalise the UK nuclear industry by confirming the first state backing of a major nuclear project in over 30 years, investing £700 million in Sizewell C. Subject to final approval, the project will support 10,000 jobs at peak construction, and provide reliable, low-carbon power to the equivalent of 6 million homes for over 60 years.

GBN, an arms-length body, will initially be led by Simon Bowen and Gwen Parry-Jones, interim Chair andCEO.

Following the launch of theSMRselection process today, once the initial stage is complete,GBNwill down-select those technologies which have met the criteria, and then enter into detailed discussions with those companies as part of an Invitation to Negotiate phase. The initial down-select will take place in the Autumn.",Grant funding package totalling up to £157 million (including £77.1 million for advanced nuclear business development and £58 million for AMR development and £22.3 million from the Nuclear Fuel Fund),Welfare,,id25_171

The black, globe-shaped memorial was blessed by the unit’s chaplain, Andrew Rawding, at a special ceremony attended by some of the families of the 14 Marines who have died in Afghanistan, civilian fundraisers including Royal Marines Association branches, and the Mayor of Taunton, Jefferson Horsley.

Lieutenant Colonel Paul James, 40 Commando’s Commanding Officer, thanked the fundraisers and others who helped build the memorial garden site. He said:

It is very moving to be here and to think this beautiful memorial and the garden was all made possible only through the generosity and kindness of people who undertook it all while we were out in Afghanistan, largely without our knowledge.

Both local people and others throughout the country helped raise money. It is a source of added pride to know that we have so much support, especially when people are giving their lives in combat.

A slow-growing memorial tree and dedicated plaque is planned for each of the fatalities in Afghanistan.

Claire Marsh and her young daughter Molly, aged four, the widow and daughter of Royal Marine David Marsh, who died in a roadside bomb blast in 2008, placed flowers at his tree and plaque. Claire said:

This garden is a lovely place to come and pay tribute to David. He was killed by an IED when driving with his colleague and friend Lieutenant John Thornton on patrol with the Fire Support Group.

They were both killed together. The garden is an ideal place to meet other families and I have spoken to John’s family today. It is very comforting to share this support. It makes me extra proud of David to be here part of the ceremony with Molly.

Lt Col James added:

It is a particularly proud moment to help launch the memorial and garden. It is a good place for families, friends and colleagues to come and reflect on the lives of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.

There is a sense of sorrow at this ceremony, but mixed with pride for what has been achieved by those with great valour, courage and selfless sacrifice.

However, families who have lost sons will find that they have gained many others through support of the family of the Royal Marines, both past and present.

Graham Rees, of the Bridgwater branch of the Royal Marines Association, helped build the memorial garden paths and set up the tree memorials. He said:

My previous unit was 40 Commando, so I have a great affinity for them. Our branch donated £250 to the fund because we veterans feel every death. When one falls in battle we all feel that loss like a family.

The ship will be acting as part of the Navy’s standing commitment in the Middle East, providing a range of capabilities from counter piracy to reassurance of the UK’s allies in the region.

Diamond’s build-up to the deployment has been extensive, having been thoroughly trained and assessed for every eventuality by the Navy’s naval training organisation, Flag Officer Sea Training.

Secretary of State for Defence, Philip Hammond MP, said:

The deployment of HMS Diamond this week marks another watershed for the Type 45 programme, with three of these highly capable destroyers now on operations worldwide. I wish her success in her Middle East deployment where the security of the international shipping lanes continues to be of the utmost importance. The Royal Navy continues to make a significant contribution to protecting the freedom of the seas and Britain’s interests across the globe.

Her Commanding Officer, Commander Ian Clarke, said:

After completing months of rigorous training and intensive engineering trials, as well as the obvious pride in our participation in the national Jubilee celebrations earlier this month, Diamond is now ready in all respects to undertake her role in her first operational deployment. The ship’s company has shown that this ship has the potential and capability to undertake the variety of likely scenarios we may encounter.

He added:

Although this will be important for the ship and my people, this is not new business for the Royal Navy, which has had a continuous presence in the Gulf for many years. The deployment of Diamond to the region is entirely routine and replaces another ship already on patrol.

HMS Diamond was launched in 2007 and commissioned into the fleet in 2011. She is the third of the Navy’s six Type 45 air defence destroyers. Four have been commissioned and the remaining two will enter service over the next two years.

The Type 45 Destroyer is the largest and most powerful Destroyer ever built for the Royal Navy. It provides UK Defence with a world class military capability.

The prime role of the Type 45 Destroyer is Air Defence - protecting UK national and allied/coalition forces against enemy aircraft and missiles. The Type 45 is fitted with the UK variant of the world-leading Principal Anti-Air Missile System (PAAMS), including the UK designed Sampson multi-function radar.

This system, named Sea Viper by the Royal Navy, has set new standards in Air Defence, capable of defending the Type 45 and ships in its company against multiple attacks from even the most sophisticated anti-ship missiles and aircraft.

All six vessels have been launched and four are now based at their home port - Portsmouth Naval Base.

The Type 45 is not only a world class Anti-Air Warfare Destroyer - it is also a multi-role, general-purpose platform, able to contribute effectively to a range of world-wide maritime, joint and Coalition operations.

The programme has protected thousands of jobs in the UK maritime sector. It has led directly to a substantial increase in investment in the skills and capabilities that the Defence Industrial Strategy identified as crucial to the UK’s ability to continue to deliver sovereign capability to the armed forces.",Deployment of HMS Diamond to the Middle East,Institutional,Market-based,id25_173

The Devonport based frigate has been conducting maritime security operations in the Indian Ocean and this visit provided an opportunity to embark supplies and victuals prior to another period at sea.

HMS Somerset’s Commanding Officer, Commander Paul Bristowe said:

It is a great honour to have participated in the celebrations; the kindness of our Tanzanian hosts has been exceptional and builds on the already excellent relations the UK enjoys with the Republic of Tanzania.

Commander Bristowe and his Executive Officer Lieutenant Commander Ben Aldous attended the day of celebrations at the National Stadium. Ben Aldous said:

The ceremony was impressive; Tanzania is proud of its independence and the event marked the occasion well. Throughout the day we were reminded of the importance of tradition and the achievements of Tanzania over the last 50 years.

The ship hosted an official reception at which British Minister for International Relations Stephen O’Brien stood alongside the Tanzanian Minister of Defence and National Service, the Honourable Doctor Mwinyi, and Vice Chief of the Tanzania People’s Defence Force (TPDF), General Mwamunuange. Mr O’Brien’s speech, made partly in Swahili, warmly acknowledged Tanzania’s successes since independence.

As part of Combined Maritime Force’s capacity-building mission in combating criminal activity at sea, HMS Somerset’s Service Police Officer, Regulating Petty Officer Emma Crawley, gave an evidence-handling lecture to members of the TPDF.

On the final evening, Commander Bristowe attended a reception on Navy Beach, hosted by Major General SS Omar, the Chief of Tanzanian Navy Command, further bonding the two navies. This cultural event was well received and brought to a close a thoroughly successful and enjoyable visit.

On departure from Dar es Salaam, HMS Somerset embarked two extra guest officers for the next patrol: Lieutenant Sikuku of the Kenyan Navy, and Lieutenant Ziguye from the Tanzanian Navy. They will train with the Royal Navy, providing an opportunity for all involved to gain a better appreciation of how other navies operate.

Lieutenant Sikuku said:

This is a great opportunity for me to experience life working with the Royal Navy on board a powerful warship.

As a busy commercial port, Dar es Salaam is reliant on secure maritime trade routes; Coalition naval ships are operating in the Indian Ocean in order to ensure the ocean remains a safe environment for all legitimate mariners.

During an operational deployment, port visits are essential to conduct maintenance and to re-supply with provisions. Tanzania is ideally located to allow the ship to replenish whilst remaining close to her allocated patrol areas.

HMS Somerset is working under Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) as part of a task force which patrols the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Oman. It is a multi-national endeavour and exists to create a lawful and stable maritime environment free from terrorism, smuggling and other illegal activities. The principal mission is to deter, disrupt and defeat such actions.

Throughout Somerset’s deployment her ship’s company will continue to promote stable and cooperative relationships with nations with whom she has contact.

It will provide comprehensive support to wounded, injured and sick personnel and their families for life.

Already, key facilities such as temporary residential accommodation, classrooms, catering facilities and a gymnasium are up and running, which will allow recovering Armed Forces personnel to move in during July 2011.

Help for Heroes has committed £32m to the renovation and running of Tedworth House and, as the lead for recovery, the MOD has committed £93m up to 2020 to provide support to all wounded, injured and sick personnel.

This includes the provision of military and civilian personnel to co-ordinate, manage and deliver the Army Recovery Capability, plus staff for each of the Personnel Recovery Centres.

Renovation work at Tedworth House is due to be completed in spring next year and, when open, the centre will be able to provide comprehensive support and residential accommodation for up to 50 wounded, injured and sick personnel from all three Services in the south of England.

Private Josh Campbell from, 23 Pioneer Regiment Royal Logistic Corps, was injured in Afghanistan when the vehicle he was travelling in struck an improvised explosive device. He said:

It’s been really tough since I was injured in 2009 but the treatment I received at Selly Oak and Headley Court has been brilliant and the support I get from the Personnel Recovery Unit has been fantastic.

I am also grateful for the assistance I’ve received from Help for Heroes and I’m really looking forward to taking advantage of all the great support facilities Tedworth House has to offer.

Brigadier Mike Griffiths, Director Personnel Services (Army), said:

This is a great achievement in the delivery of the Army Recovery Capability and one which pays tribute to the strong relationships that have been forged between the Ministry of Defence, Help for Heroes and the Royal British Legion.

Bryn Parry, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of Help for Heroes, said:

When I think back to October 2007 when we first started in the Tidworth Tin Hut, the thing I always remember is driving past Tedworth House on the way to work and thinking, wouldn’t it be great if that could be a recovery centre for the guys and girls.

It’s been an incredible effort on all fronts to get it ready in such a quick space of time but to know that in a few days the first residents will be in is fantastic.

It’s a truly awesome moment for myself and Emma and everyone who has worked so hard to make this moment possible.

Help for Heroes also intends to introduce a pathfinder ‘support hub’ at the PRAC to provide an ongoing welfare and specialist support centre for wounded, injured or sick soldiers after they transition to civilian life.

Chris Simpkins, Director General of the Royal British Legion, said:

The Royal British Legion stands shoulder to shoulder with all who serve, so the Legion’s support for the Army Recovery Capability is central to our welfare strategy in this our 90th year, and well beyond.

We are delighted that we will be contributing to the operating costs of PRAC Tidworth, and providing welfare support and advice to residents. We support the men and women who have given so much for our country - whether they return to duty or move into civilian life.

That is what the Legion has been doing for 90 years. The wounded, injured and sick deserve nothing less. The Royal British Legion will continue to support them, and their families, for the rest of their lives.

Tedworth House is just one centre in the network of five Personnel Recovery Centres that form part of the Army Recovery Capability, a joint multi-million pound venture between the MOD, Help for Heroes and the Royal British Legion.

LSgt Jackman exercised with the company, passed a team medic course, and received training on a host of weapon systems before being deployed; but even this extensive training did not fully prepare him for the task he faced:

When we got dropped off by the Chinook on the helipad at the base and it took off, my first reaction was just that ‘this is really surreal’,” LSgt Jackman said.

I was excited at first, and, as we arrived in the PB, I thought to myself it will be all right because I thought we would have the facilities there to do some cooking, but it was to my surprise that we got in there and realised that actually there was nothing in there. It was all being built by the engineers so we had to search around and find what we could.

At first it was a case of collecting together all the ammo boxes for improvised cookery and using all the things we have been taught over the years but never thought we would have to use.

So I set my kitchen up next to an ammo bunker - though it wasn’t an ammo bunker at the time - and was just feeding people using ammo tins. Then after a while with each resupply we would get little bits and bobs that the Master Chef would have loaded on and we slowly got our cookhouse set up.

Using two Number 5 cooksets, a couple of six-gallon (27-litre) pots, a few improvised pans and a poncho, LSgt Jackman was soon supporting some 160 soldiers on his own, using mainly ten-man operational ration packs.

Initially, LSgt Jackman provided a hot breakfast every day with fresh bread and three to four hot dinners every week.

The ethos of chefs within the Royal Logistic Corps is that they are soldiers first and chefs second, so LSgt Jackman also supported the company in an infantry role, conducting patrols with the company and finding himself involved in contacts with the enemy on numerous occasions:

My first ever patrol with the lads was a bit surreal,” LSgt Jackman said. “They offered me the chance to go out and I said ‘yes’ thinking it would be a routine patrol… well, I suppose it was a routine patrol for them!

It started at half [past] three in the morning, and the first thing we had to do was cross a bunker, and I was the last man. It was hard to get across there, so that was an eye-opener - knowing I had to do a further nine-hour walk around Babaji while taking up various positions.

And then my first ever contact occurred - which was massively hairy. I volunteered to get on a roof and within 30 seconds of getting on the roof it all went mad.

LSgt Jackman’s Company Commander described his actions in the face of the enemy as ‘extremely courageous and utterly professional’.

Back in camp, as further equipment arrived, LSgt Jackman was able to re-site his makeshift kitchen under more suitable but improvised shelter, and constructed an outstanding kitchen/dining area. He made tables and chairs from planks of wood and ammunition boxes and created a social area for troops to relax.

Christmas saw the first arrival of substantial fresh rations and he produced a roast turkey dinner with starter and pudding for more than 200 personnel.

From then on, LSgt Jackman received fresh rations on a weekly basis to sustain five days of meals combined with two days’ operational ration packs:

I made bread, and that seemed to be the most popular thing with the lads,” he said. “We had to just use ration packs at first and it was bread that everyone was missing.

His day often started at 0200hrs so that he could provide outgoing patrols with a hot breakfast and again on their return. LSgt Jackman selflessly, and with high spirits, sustained this gruelling routine for a further four months:

When I tell people, they don’t believe I did it,” he joked. “Sometimes I don’t believe it myself!

LSgt Jackman’s professionalism was underlined when, towards the latter end of the tour, a suicide bomber detonated himself in the busy market place some 100 yards (90m) from the patrol base.

LSgt Jackman was one of the first on site to provide medical support. On arrival at the scene, he witnessed utter carnage and panic. 37 local people had been killed in the blast, including women and children, and more than 60 were wounded, with injuries ranging from burns to missing limbs.

LSgt Jackman worked tirelessly for the best part of the day treating the wounded and assisting with the disturbing and nauseating clean-up afterwards.

Nothing could have prepared him for this complete devastation but his citation states that LSgt Jackman demonstrated ‘outstanding courage and professionalism throughout this harrowing event and contributed extensively to the preservation of human life’.

On returning to the patrol base later that night, LSgt Jackman continued preparing dinner for the company as usual.

For his contribution, LSgt Jackman was awarded the Food Services Warrant Officer Trophy at the end of the tour - an honour which recognises him as an inspirational role model for all young Royal Logistic Corps chefs.",Provision of hot meals and cooking facilities,Welfare,,id25_176

HMS Iron Duke, a Type 23 frigate, returned on a high from operations in July 2011 having spent almost seven months east of the Suez Canal.

On leaving Portsmouth in January 2011 her duties included working with other navies to combat smuggling and human trafficking in support of counter-terrorism.

She then sailed to the Gulf on maritime security operations where she patrolled the Al Basrah Oil Terminal.

The last part of her deployment saw her providing naval gunfire support to operations off the coast of Libya.

For three consecutive nights HMS Iron Duke used her awesome firepower capabilities to destroy a gun battery outside the besieged city of Misurata and fired star shells into the night sky to illuminate pro-Gaddafi positions for NATO aircraft to destroy rocket launchers, fuel dumps, ammo stores, artillery batteries and command and control centres.

Report by Lorraine McBride.",Ministry of Defence,10 August 2011,"The Defence Reform Review, published last month, is the biggest root-and-branch change in Defence in 30 years.

Among the key changes that Lord Levene in his far-reaching review has called for is a smaller, stronger Defence Board, a smaller more strategic head office, cutting the number of senior staff, giving extra powers to the Service Chiefs to run their own budgets, strengthening financial management, and creating a new four-star-led Joint Forces Command.

Defence Secretary Dr Liam Fox, who commissioned the report last August, has accepted all of Lord Levene’s recommendations.

Jon Day supports Lord Levene’s recommendations to create a slimmed down Defence Board (MOD’s key decision-making body) and clarify the responsibilities of the MOD’s leaders and increase their accountability:

It is necessary because power without accountability is a recipe for bad decision-making,” he says. “Under the new system, as the MOD’s accounting officer, Permanent Secretary Ursula Brennan will personally eyeball TLB [Top Level Budget] holders and say, ‘OK you’re not performing here, why not, and what are we going to do about it?’

MOD’s budget black hole has been widely publicised. A key plank of Defence Reform is to strengthen financial management with a greater focus on affordability:

A lot of this is about balancing the budget,” explains Mr Day. “If you hold people to account, there has to be a realistic balance between the money they are given and what we ask them to do. Following the SDSR [Strategic Defence and Security Review], MOD’s budget is broadly in balance, which is an important first step.

Mr Day believes that the MOD is undergoing a culture change. During the Cold War, there was an implicit trade-off between capabilities, the speed at which they could be delivered into service, and value for money. Since then, because of our commitment to real operations, recent governments have concentrated on getting the right capability into service quickly, which was often at the expense of value for money:

We are now in different circumstances”, he says frankly. “The unprecedented budget deficit obliges Defence, and the rest of Government, to make major savings to live within the country’s means.

This is a defence issue because, if we do not balance our financial books, effective armed forces will become unaffordable. So one of the critical things for everyone in Defence is to focus on value for money in every decision that we make.

Mr Day is a veteran of previous defence reviews and reform initiatives, but points out that this review is different because of the financial background:

The fact that the Government has made dealing with the nation’s financial problems its absolute priority means that the context for this defence review is tougher than any I have known,” he says.

Another of Lord Levene’s recommendations is to make the head office smaller and more strategic. Mr Day says he doubts that bureaucracy will reduce simply because there are fewer staff:

Sadly, I don’t think that is the case,” he says. “My strong view is unless we actively reduce our workload, prioritise more effectively and change our culture and behaviour, we will carry on doing the same things we’ve always done but less well, failing to meet our objectives and piling more pressure on people. A vital part of Defence Reform is to change the way in which we do our business so that we can be effective with fewer people.

Trying to change the behaviours and culture of Defence is a problem that has plagued the MOD for decades and Mr Day warns of the danger of not staying the course:

Each time we have a review, we identify the problems but we don’t follow through on what we know is the right thing to do. We somehow lack the stamina to make change enduring. That must not happen this time.

A draft blueprint for the future head office and the relationship with the TLBs will be worked on over the summer for delivery in early September. There will then be a period of consultation to help Defence Secretary Dr Fox reach final decisions:

Thereafter, it will be for the TLBs to go away and redesign their own organisations in line with Lord Levene’s principles and the blueprint we have provided,” Mr Day said.

Defence Reform is part of the broader transformation agenda which is implementing the SDSR. Transformation covers over 70 workstrands, from rebasing the Army from Germany to the Whole Force Concept. Defence Reform is a key enabler to this programme. Mr Day stresses that the Defence Reform agenda is challenging but doable:

The aim is to implement Defence Reform by April 2013. Some measures will be in place well before then and others will take longer to complete. This is a demanding but realistic timetable. We are very good at reorganising ourselves, we’ve done it time and time again. As I stressed earlier, it is much harder to change culture and behaviours. That will be really difficult. But we must succeed this time.

Another big test will be keeping the MOD’s show on the road as radical change is implemented:

You have highlighted a major challenge between now and 2013. Transition needs to be planned properly and given the necessary resources. Part of the blueprint will be about that.

But he makes it plain that the onus is on staff at all levels to identify lower priority activities that we can reduce, postpone or stop doing completely:

We will provide guidance and top cover but everyone in Defence knows things that are less important or unnecessary.

Jon Day is optimistic:

This could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to transform the way in which we work for the better. Defence will be different for everyone by 2013. We should not talk ourselves down. We have the fourth largest defence budget in the world. We can mount complex and enduring operations. We have extraordinary equipment programmes that we are bringing into effect. We can do transformation.

The contracts are estimated to be worth between £500m and £600m per annum, and more than £5 billion over 10 years, exclusive of construction projects.

The prime contracts will now be awarded in early 2014, and the first Capital Work Framework - for East Midlands and Eastern England - will be awarded in August 2013. This revised schedule reflects the impact of various emerging factors, including the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR), the creation of DIO and the high degree of industry interest shown by industry which led to the evaluation process taking longer than planned.

HM Treasury has formally approved the changes to the programme and the necessary extensions to the existing UK contracts.

Steve Rice, Head of NGEC, said:

We now have in place formal approval to take forward this major procurement programme, and I am encouraged by the enthusiasm of industry to be involved in delivering these new contracts. We all recognise the importance of NGEC for our military customers, and we will continue to work with our current contractors to ensure that existing service levels are maintained right up to the new arrangements coming into service.

The programme is currently in the early stages of competitive dialogue and bidder tendering for the prime contracts and capital works frameworks.

NGEC sits within the wider Transforming Defence agenda, contributing to the creation of a smaller, more professional Ministry of Defence that supports Ministers in setting and meeting clear priorities, supports the Armed Forces in delivering what they are tasked to do, and reports honestly and openly on its activities and performance.

The Sharpshooter’s considerable range takes it into the realm of sniper territory, but it requires far less training, being more similar to the standard service rifle than the highly-specialised weapons used by those in the sniper profession:

Royal Marine Sergeant Baz Evans of 40 Commando said:

I have fired over 1,000 rounds on the rifle in training; accurately hitting targets over 800 metres away. The new Sharpshooter rifle provides quick and accurate fire, with the flexibility of using it in the assault rifle role as well. It’s hoofing.

More than 400 of the semi-automatic L129A1 Sharpshooter rifles have been bought as an Urgent Operational Requirement.

Colonel Peter Warden, Light Weapons, Photographic and Batteries Team Leader at Defence Equipment and Support, said:

The Sharpshooter rifle is very capable and has been bought to fulfil a specific role on the front line in Afghanistan. It is a versatile weapon which will give our units a new dimension to their armoury. It will complement the SA80 A2 by adding to the weapons available to commanders on the ground.

The Tankies use their well-armoured vehicles to move infantry between defensive positions and provide fire support to soldiers fighting on foot.

Lieutenant Dan Berry, aged 26, commands a group of five Mastiff crews:

My men are fighting crews,” he explained. “We can adapt our tank skills to use the Mastiff aggressively and react to the insurgents.

The Mastiff can pack a serious punch by mounting either the general purpose, heavy, or grenade machine gun.

Sergeant Harley Upham is happy with how it performs in combat. He said:

Mastiff has got a power traverse so it’s really easy to swing the turret round; the fire power is second-to-none and we can carry bags of ammunition.

The vehicle is well-protected and specifically designed to shield its crew and passengers from mines as well as machine gun fire. Sgt Upham has already deployed in Mastiff to Iraq. He said:

It’s one of the most robust vehicles we have; I myself have been hit in it twice and been OK.

The off-road course at Camp Bastion is designed to push the vehicles and drivers to the limit in order to give troops the confidence and experience they need before deploying in the vehicles on operations [Picture: Corporal Mark Webster, Crown Copyright/MOD 2010]

A drawback of the original Mastiff is its limited cargo capacity when loaded with troops. To solve this problem, 2 RTR has deployed with a new cargo variant of Mastiff called Wolfhound.

Wolfhound combines the protection and fire power of a Mastiff with a flatbed for cargo:

We can carry extra food, water and ammunition to stay out on the ground for longer; we can also transport more of the lads’ kit between checkpoints,” said Sgt David Roberts.

But Wolfhound has the same fighting capability as Mastiff as well.

Nad ‘Ali is hot and dusty - a far cry from the green fields of southern England from where most of the Tankies come.

Lt Berry said:

It’s one of the strangest places I’ve ever been, although it’s not the prettiest. You’ve got to hand it to the people here - they’re scraping an existence out of the place and they’re very tough.

All in all it has been a busy start to the tour. Squadron Sergeant Major Chris Atwell outlined the fast and furious pace of life for his men:

They were joined by Defence Minister Andrew Robathan; Vice Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir Nicholas Houghton; the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope; Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton; and the Lord Mayor of the City of London, Nick Anstee.

The reception was part of the national Cadet150 celebrations, marking 150 years of Cadet Forces, which comprise the Sea Cadet Corps, Army Cadet Force, Air Training Corps and the Combined Cadet Force based out of schools.

There are currently 25,000 adult volunteers working with 131,000 cadets across the UK, and, in this anniversary year, the Cadet Forces have called for more people from all walks of life to become volunteers.

The reception coincided with the publication of a study commissioned by Cadet150 into public attitudes towards volunteering and giving up their free time as part of National Volunteers’ Week which runs from 1 to 7 June 2010.

Speaking at the reception Mr Robathan said:

Today we are celebrating and thanking our cadet adult volunteers. There are currently 25,000 within the Cadet Forces, selflessly giving up their free time to provide young people with adventurous training, activities and skills that they will use in adulthood.

The Cadet Forces could not function without these outstanding individuals, and I urge people from all walks of life to volunteer for such a worthwhile institution.

Flight Lieutenant Will Close-Ash, a volunteer with the Air Training Corps from Bedlington, Northumberland, attended the reception with his partner Naomi Bousfield, herself a cadet volunteer. Speaking at the reception he said:

Today has been a real pat on the back for all cadet volunteers who contribute so much of their own free time.

The satisfaction I feel, particularly when taking young people on exciting adventure training, is seeing them constantly achieving things for themselves, gaining vital skills for adulthood.

Following the reception, volunteers and cadets from the Corps of Drums of the South East London Army Cadet Force performed Beating Retreat in Guildhall Yard, with the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff and the Lord Mayor of the City of London taking the salute.

Yesterday’s reception is the first of two national events marking the 150th anniversary of Cadet Forces in the UK.

The 12-month project ends in December, but some 75 properties have already been refurbished, with 48 families now enjoying the benefits of living in modernised energy efficient houses.

Cavalry Barracks provides accommodation for Service families stationed with the Guards Regiments. With most soldiers away from home for long periods of time, either training or on operational duty, providing a welcoming home environment plays an important part in supporting their families.

Major General George Norton CBE, General Commanding London District said:

I was hugely impressed by the transformation of the properties in Beavers and Cavalry Crescent. I very much hope that this estate will form the core of the Welsh Guards family community in Hounslow.’

Originally built in the 1960s, the houses were stripped out in order to replace, refit and in some cases redesign the internal living areas.

Improvements include new kitchens; new bathrooms with thermostatic showers; new roofs with better loft insulation; new curtains, carpets and flooring; redecoration; and the replacement of internal doors. Security has been improved with new windows and doors, whilst the upgraded properties now have new energy-efficient central heating and have been re-wired.

To complete the transformation of the area and meet the needs of residents, a new play park has also been installed with a range of play equipment suitable for younger children along with more adventurous play equipment for older children.

Major Philip Hacker, SO2 G1 Ops Gen, London District added:

I believe that this kind of holistic regeneration of a Service family estate is vital as it pulls the community together. It is wonderful to hear that the Army Welfare Service and other welfare organisations, MHS, DIO and the local schools are working together towards developing a thriving community that Service families can enjoy and be proud of.

Local Service family residents Lance Corporal Paul and Mrs Sarah Bell said:

This is the best move we have had so far. The houses look lovely and the interiors are fantastic.

Air Commodore Alan Opie, Head of DIO Operations Accommodation said:

DIO’s top priority is to support our Armed Forces and their families. I am really pleased with what I have seen in Hounslow and I truly believe it is what we are aiming to achieve.

While recovering, Colonel David Richmond has been speaking out on behalf of all wounded soldiers. Report by Sharon Kean.",Ministry of Defence,1 September 2010,"When Colonel David Richmond stood up to address a room filled with suits and uniforms at last year’s MOD welfare conference, few could have been prepared for the emotional account that would follow.

The former Commanding Officer of 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland spoke candidly of the day he was seriously wounded in Afghanistan and the long and painful recovery that ensued:

Being injured is a frightening thing,” he said at the time. “You enter into a new era of your life and you don’t know what will happen next.

Colonel Richmond was shot in the thigh by a single bullet from a Taliban AK-47. It shattered his femur, and, more than two years later, his leg is still fitted with a metal frame supporting the bone as it painfully grows back.

His public criticism of compensation for those injured while serving led to him joining the committee supporting a thorough review of the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme:

I think the unique position of being a relatively senior officer and a casualty gave me an insight the committee otherwise would not have had,” said Colonel Richmond. “I have an understanding of the emotions you go through, the challenges and the frustrations.

Colonel David Richmond is part of a committee of experts looking at compensation for injured soldiers [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2010]

Colonel Richmond not only has first-hand experience of the journey from battlefield to home, via numerous hospitals, but he has met many others who have had similar experiences:

At Headley Court [the military rehabilitation centre] I have fairly frank discussions about their thoughts, fears and concerns. That has been very useful for the review,” he said.

I knew they were unhappy that, under the old scheme, if you had two broken legs you’d get the complete money for one broken leg and a discounted amount for the second. Often we’re not talking about simple breaks; we’re talking about legs in bits. That sense of injustice was what I was trying to convey.

Colonel Richmond’s strong personal views also influenced consideration of the process of submitting claims:

The burden shouldn’t be on the claimant to make the claim, to pursue it and then worry about it,” he said. “That person has probably got a million other things to worry about. He could be blind or only have one limb.

Individuals are vulnerable at that time. You need this system as a crutch, supporting you, not something you’ve got to chase and to fight.

He describes the scheme as ‘much better’ following the review, and he praises improvements made to the assessment of those with multiple injuries, such as those wounded by improvised explosive devices in Afghanistan:

Many significant improvements were made, which is important because so many of these fellows have life-changing injuries.

The Colonel is still concerned about the impact serious injuries have on the families of servicemen and women:

Welfare care for families at Selly Oak is outstanding but a complaint among some of the families is that, while the casualty is looked after so well at Headley Court and beyond, they feel like they’ve fallen off the end of the world when they leave,” he said.

There might be 100 reasons for that but none of them are good. Families need a hand, and it’s something we are becoming better at. The three Services, together with the Defence Medical Services are addressing this.

Colonel Richmond is continuing to use his experience to help improve care for injured soldiers as a member of the Interim Independent Medical Expert Group:

We are looking at the most appropriate levels of compensation for specific, particularly challenging, injuries that the current injury descriptors used by the scheme don’t cover well,” he explained.

Things like mental health, hearing loss, spinal cord injuries, paired limb or organ injuries. These injures are very serious at any age, but at 18 or 19 they can be dire. We’re looking to bring together a package of compensation and opportunities that haven’t been there before.

On the subject of mental health, he has this to say:

Some of the things we’ve asked young men to do and some of the things they’ve been involved in or suffered must have an emotional impact. Whether that is serious and long-term or just a temporary thing will vary from individual to individual.

The Services are much more aware of these issues than they ever have been, and we’re doing the best we can given what we know at the minute.

Colonel Richmond’s account of his experiences on being wounded is on theHelp for Heroes website.

185,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/military-torchbearers-carry-the-paralympic-flame,News story,Military torchbearers carry the Paralympic Flame,A small team of military personnel will tonight carry the Flame in the final leg of the London 2012 Paralympic Games Torch Relay. Report by Lorraine McBride.,Ministry of Defence,29 August 2012,"With just hours to go until the Paralympic Games begin, a team of military personnel (past and present) will join inspirational people from across the UK to light the way to the Paralympic Games by carrying the Paralympic Flame from Stoke Mandeville on its final leg to the Olympic Park.

One torchbearer is Major (Ret’d) Martin Colclough who will lead a team in the Paralympic Torch Relay comprising Battle Back founder Colonel Fred Hargreaves, Staff Sergeant Matt Raasch-Sotwina and Acting Lance Corporal Mike Goody, as well as physiotherapist Kate Sherman from Headley Court. Martin is a linchpin of Battle Back, the programme that has done so much to encourage adaptive sport and adventurous training opportunities for wounded, injured and sick personnel from across the Armed Forces.

Martin is deeply proud that he was selected to carry the Flame, doubtless in tribute to co-founding Battle Back four years ago, when he was a serving Army officer:

It’s a biggie and going to be a real privilege to be able to help kick off the Games,” said Martin as he reflected on the unique honour.

Martin was the first boss of MOD’s Battle Back programme and has seen it grow from an acorn to the nationally-respected initiative that instils drive into injured Service personnel and helps them realise their sporting dreams.

The team will run in Newham, passing the torch between them on the final leg as they approach Stratford’s Olympic Stadium at about 2145hrs tonight when the world’s eyes will be on the Opening Ceremony inside the stadium.

Each runner will hold the torch for 300 yards (274m), linked by their close ties with both Battle Back and Help for Heroes, the charity that, with the MOD, founded Battle Back and has been involved from the outset providing financial and design input.

Through Martin’s connections with Help for Heroes, he has nominated 13 servicemen to take part in a Paralympic Inspiration Programme - their goal to become Paralympians of the future. He’ll then move into the Paralympic Village to join the British Paralympic Association’s staff, and is working with LOCOG (London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games) on injured servicemen’s involvement in both the opening and closing ceremonies, though he’s understandably tight-lipped on the details.

Another team member is Colonel Fred Hargreaves, a Royal Signals officer and self-confessed ‘ski nut’. Colonel Hargreaves set up the first adaptive ski exercise in Bavaria named ‘Snow Warrior Adaptive’ in 2008 that evolved into the Battle Back programme

More recently Help for Heroes and the British Paralympic Association have launched ‘Frontline to Startline’, an initiative to help wounded Service personnel progress into becoming professional athletes. The Royal British Legion has also joined the programme recently, funding the Battle Back centre at Lilleshall.

Throughout his 27-year military career Colonel Hargreaves enjoyed taking part in sport and set up the scheme to ensure injured Service personnel were also given the chance to do something different and fun.

Martin says Colonel Hargreaves was a natural choice:

Fred has done so much to promote disability sports; without him and Battle Back many of our wounded, injured and sick would not be where they are today. A number of Paralympic athletes have been helped by Fred, and are the best demonstration of what he has achieved.

Colonel Fred Hargreaves [Picture: Help for Heroes]

Colonel Hargreaves is grateful for the support he has received from Help for Heroes:

With similar values, visions and focus on the injured individual and their family, Help for Heroes has consistently provided vital moral, physical and financial support to Battle Back and all its participants. I am immensely pleased with the support Help for Heroes has offered Battle Back since the very earliest days of both organisations. They complement each other brilliantly.

Colonel Hargreaves was touched by the nomination to carry the torch. He said:

Having launched Battle Back 60 years to the day after the first Stoke Mandeville Games [28 July 2008], the precursor to the Paralympics created for the wounded of the Second World War, it is particularly poignant that we are able to once more recognise the contribution and sacrifice made by the military, as well as the significant physical and psychological benefits that competitors enjoy.

Staff Sergeant Matt Raasch-Sotwina also spoke of his excitement to be involved in a once-in-a-generation event. SSgt Raasch-Sotwina, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2008, had been invited by Battle Back to try water skiing after surgery left him partially paralysed, deaf in his left ear and suffering with balance and coordination problems.

SSgt Raasch-Sotwina, a Senior Non-Commissioned Officer serving with 24 Commando Engineer Regiment, only just fell short of his aim to qualify for Britain’s Paralympic team. His new goal is to become the first person to fly a flexwing microlight in Antarctica.

SSgt Raasch-Sotwina praised Battle Back for helping him along his road to recovery:

The support I’ve had has been amazing; after being at Headley Court, Battle Back offered to take me water skiing. They make you feel like nothing is impossible, no injury or disability gets in the way of doing sport, and for a time you forget what you can’t do and get on with it.

SSgt Raasch-Sotwina, a retired sprinter, still can’t believe that he’s been nominated to carry the torch:

I feel privileged because it’s something I’m doing in my own country in front of the British public and I’m honoured because I’m carrying it for my daughters and family but also my regiment who supported me and gave me time to train, Battle Back who played a key part in my rehabilitation, and Help for Heroes who financially helped me while I’ve been training.

It’s even more exciting after seeing the excitement around the Olympic Torch,” continued SSgt Raasch-Sotwina.

His big moment will be even more special as it will be witnessed by his daughters and partner along with his mother, brother, sisters and wider family:

I’m welling up as I speak,” he said. “I decided not to carry on with athletics when I was unlikely to miss the final grade and tried to distance myself from sport, so to be nominated regardless is quite an honour. When I read my nomination, I think it can’t be me. Equally, I feel emotional and proud and to have this opportunity is indescribable.

The youngest member of the team is Acting Lance Corporal Mike Goody who was injured in an improvised explosive device blast in Kandahar province in 2008. LCpl Goody is a shining example of a serviceman who has grabbed every opportunity to use sport to help him lead a more independent life.

The trainee paramedic is also a talented athlete. Singled out through a talent identification programme for swimming in 2010, LCpl Goody has qualified as a professional water ski and archery instructor.

Following the bomb blast, LCpl Goody suffered permanent damage to bones in his feet and underwent an elective amputation last year. Now he reckons that he’s a better swimmer than ever and has competed in a cross-Channel swim with other injured servicemen:

I’m very humbled to be carrying the Paralympic Torch,” said LCpl Goody. “Everyone caught a bit of Olympic fever with the Games and hosting the Paralympic Games on home turf will really boost disability sport across the country, raise awareness, and hopefully it will inspire people to get involved.",Battle Back programme and related initiatives (including ‘Frontline to Startline’ and talent identification programmes),Welfare,,id25_185

He says that his second priority is a cross-Government, policy-led, resource-informed Strategic Defence and Security Review, with a thorough examination of our force structure, looking at the overall shape, size and role of Armed Forces personnel and MOD civil servants, including the Reserve Forces.

Dr Fox states that in every aspect of Defence, particularly in the support area, he will be looking to bear down on costs, and that he intends to follow through on the commitment in the Coalition Agreement to reduce the MOD’s running costs by 25 per cent.

Internationally, Dr Fox states that the core of UK security must remain NATO and that the US will be our major partner but we will also step up bilateral co-operation with France and other partners, and revitalise a broad programme of defence diplomacy.

He also said he expects to reset the MOD’s relationship with the defence industry to reflect our changed economic circumstances and push ahead with the process of acquisition reform.

Dr Fox’s full message to all military and civilian staff here follows:

Following discussions with my MOD ministerial colleagues, PUS [Permanent Under Secretary], CDS [Chief of the Defence Staff], and other members of my top team, I have agreed the following objectives and priorities for the remainder of 2010.

“Afghanistan will remain the top priority. Our people in theatre must get the best possible support. Counter-insurgency needs strategic patience but by the end of the year I expect that we can show significant progress with the mission, building on previous achievements, consolidating ISAF’s hold in central Helmand, and accelerating the training of the Afghan security forces that is already ahead of target.

“Achieving success in Afghanistan must not prevent us from conducting our other operational commitments effectively or from preparing to meet other contingencies, particularly in the Middle East. I shall be conducting a thorough stocktake of our contingency plans in the months ahead.

“The focus for many of us in the next six months, and my second priority, will be on conducting a cross-Government, policy-led, resource-informed Strategic Defence and Security Review [SDSR]. I am determined that this exercise will bring defence policy, plans, commitments and resources into balance, and produce over time a transformative change to British Defence.

Both men are members of 656 Squadron, of 4 Regiment Army Air Corps, who had been on HMS Ocean in the Mediterranean learning to operate the Apache off Royal Navy ships when they were retasked to take part in operations over Libya as part of NATO’s Operation UNIFIED PROTECTOR.

Apache fly slower and lower than any UK aircraft in theatre and are consistently within a two-kilometre range of the enemy.

Despite the risk, Major Neville encouraged and commanded his aircrews to attack a well-equipped enemy armed with more than 20,000 man-portable surface-to-air missiles and in excess of 1,000 anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) pieces.

On 22 missions the Apaches commanded by Major Neville hit more than 100 targets, firing 99 Hellfire missiles and 4,800 30mm cannon rounds.

Major Neville flew on ten of these operations and his Apache was routinely targeted by small arms fire as well as SA-24 missiles. In one of these attacks he was targeted as he was engaging an enemy communication network, but continued to see his task through while making sure there were no civilian casualties.

On another occasion 30 miles inland - and therefore with very little chance of a quick rescue if he was shot down - his helicopter came under anti-aircraft fire. Again Major Neville continued on with his task, and only returned to HMS Ocean when he had achieved his mission.

The threat to Major Neville and his crew was unprecedented and his actions set the standard for other Apache crews throughout the tour.

The citation states:

It is his outstanding bravery in command, while understanding the risk he takes on every mission, that make him a remarkable officer and worthy of recognition.

Major Neville said:

I am immensely proud to receive this honour. It is about recognising 18 months of work to build a team to achieve a challenging task that I never expected to be putting into action myself. The air and ground crews under my command faced unprecedented professional demands but achieved all that was asked of them.

We were operating in a high-threat environment and flying low, fast and at night to mitigate the risks. Despite these challenges, we hit all the targets given to us without any of our helicopters being damaged or any injuries to our crews.

For the engineers, working on a ship presents difficulties of space and the volume of spares and equipment that can be carried. But through their hard work, aircraft were available for every mission and they all took off with all systems working perfectly.

In the event for which WO1 Lane was awarded his Mention in Dispatches, he was a front seat aircraft commander in the second pair of Apache helicopters directed to target an enemy command and control centre between Misurata and Zlitan.

As the helicopter began its attack run, WO1 Lane was engaged by an SA-24 Surface to Air missile. Holding his nerve as the missile soared towards him, he was able to identify its firing point before using the aircraft’s flares to decoy the missile and return fire.

WO1 Lane does not mind admitting to being genuinely in fear of never seeing them again in the seconds before the flare drew the missile away from the Apache.

He said:

It all happened really quickly, probably about five to six seconds, but as I saw the missile heading for us, I did think this could be it.

Although I had come under small arms fire and anti-aircraft artillery attack before, this was the first time I had experienced a surface to air missile and, despite going through that scenario in a simulator, it was a real shock.

The flare was deployed and I watched as the missile swerved at the last second. The adrenaline was pumping, my heart was thumping out of my chest.

There was a sense of tremendous relief, followed by the realisation that it could happen again so we broke away from that zone but still had another aircraft engaging the target in that area.

WO1 Lane had to make the decision to go back, identify the enemy, and neutralise the threat:

It was very frightening,” he said. “We had got away with it once. We did not know what else was there but knew the assets the enemy had access to.

But because of the kit on the aircraft, we had been able to pinpoint the enemy position quickly after they fired on us. We found a rocket launcher which had been used to shoot at ships off the coast and destroyed it.

His actions allowed the helicopters to carry on with their original mission before returning to the missile firing point to destroy its capabilities.

WO1 Lane is no stranger to enemy fire having served two tours in Afghanistan and six in Iraq. His aircraft have been hit three times by small arms fire. On one occasion a bullet flew into the cockpit, went through his visor and out through his helmet, miraculously leaving him with just a shrapnel wound.

As a result, this is WO1 Lane’s second Mention In Dispatches and he also has a Queen’s Commendation For Bravery.","Recognition Awards (Queen’s Commendation, Mention In Dispatches)",Other,,id25_187

The fifteen days of celebration…",Ministry of Defence,3 October 2011,"The festival of Dashain is the longest, most auspicious and joyous time of the year for Gurkhas of the Hindu faith. The fifteen days of celebration occur during the bright lunar fortnight in late September and early October, ending on the day of the full moon.

In preparation for Dashain, every home in Nepal is ceremonially cleaned, decorated and painted for the visit of Durga - the Goddess of Power.

In the Brigade of Gurkhas the festival is celebrated annually with ritual sacrifices, fastings, blessings and major social events. Whether 2 RGR is on camp, on exercise or on operations the festival is celebrated in one form or another.

As the Rear Party in Brunei, where 2 RGR is based, started to celebrate the festival, the Gurkhas out in Patrol Base Chilli kept morale high by having their own party. The patrol base has no running or heated water, no air-conditioning, no plumbing, and only the most austere amenities, but this did not dampen the party spirit.

Major Jamie Murray, Officer Commanding of B Company, 2 RGR, said the point of the ceremony is to honour the Hindu gods. He said:

What the Gurkhas do in this instance is pay their respects to Goddess Durga and therefore hope that the battalion is blessed as a result.

As part of the festival the Gurkha Major leads selected men, known as pujaries, in a fast and a period of deep praying in the battalion temple.

In Helmand province the Gurkhas have improvised their own temples, be they tents or a few posters on a wall. The hand-picked pujaries give themselves to the gods and prepare for the important day of ritual blessings.

Rifleman Yadesh Rai was chosen as a pujarie and had the privilege of conducting the rituals. Yadesh, as is custom, was presented with gifts from his chain of command, money was placed in his turban, and red tika was rubbed onto his face as a mark of respect for his efforts. He said:

This is the greatest honour that can be bestowed on me and I’m even more honoured in that the circumstances are different.

Second-in-Command of B Company, Captain Gajendra Diwan, said:

As we come to the end of our tour in Afghanistan, with the blessings of Goddess Durga, we are confident that we will go home safely.

Major Murray said celebrating Dashain is a real morale-boost for the Gurkhas of 2 RGR. He explained:

It’s hugely important. The men are full of spirits and full of beans. If you considered it on our Christian calendar to be Christmas, this is Christmas Day. The men’s religious needs are satisfied… it means a great, great deal to them.

In barracks, British soldiers normally cover the duties of the Gurkhas during Dashain who then reciprocate the favour at Christmas time.

After a second year in a row celebrating Dashain away from their families, having spent last year on the chilly hills of Salisbury Plain during pre-deployment training, 2 RGR are looking forward to holding next year’s festivities back in Brunei.",Celebrating Dashain,Other,Informational,id25_188

Since then Chief Inspector Gillen has moved around quite a bit during his MOD Police career, but always returning to the naval base where he is currently posted for the third time.

During this latest period at the base he has built up a reputation for getting things done safely, securely and to Clyde’s high standards. That’s why when his fellow traffic committee members proposed creating ‘Gillen Road’, it was changed to reflect how they liked things done - the ‘Gillen Way’!

Chief Inspector Gillen said:

It’s not everyone who gets to have a road named after them. Usually you have to be dead! But in all seriousness I am very honoured and it was a great privilege to officially open the road at the start of this month.

The road, which runs past the naval base’s giant £120m Neptune Building Supermess, is one of several new roads named in recent weeks.

Others on the Defence Estate reflect the history of the occupants of HM Naval Base Clyde with names such as Churchill Road, Comacchio Crescent, Swiftsure Street and Trafalgar Way.

Originally from Greenock, Chief Inspector Gillen became a MOD police officer in 1987, working on military escort duties before being seconded to the CID at Rosyth.

A qualified police trainer, he has spent time seconded to Greater Manchester Police and the Prince’s Trust volunteers based at Anniesland College where he became project manager for teams working in Anniesland, Possil and Springburn.

Over the years he has also been involved in a revamp of military convoy escorts and the establishment of community policing on the MOD estate.

He has also been seconded to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as Head of International Policing - establishing and supporting policing missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo, Sierra Leone and Sudan.","Naming of roads (Gillen Road, Churchill Road, etc.)",Other,,id25_189

Lynx helicopters from 702 Naval Air Squadron (NAS) in Yeovilton and Merlins of 820 Naval Air Squadron in Culdrose have joined ‘Lusty’, as the ship is affectionately known, in the Channel ahead of seven weeks in the hands of the Navy’s most exacting training organisation.

The veteran warship - converted to a commando and helicopter carrier during her £40m refit completed in July 2011 - is about to embark on operational sea training off Plymouth.

The seven-week package tests the 750-plus men and women aboard on everything the 22,000-tonne ship might be expected to deal with in the real world, for in the new year she’ll be Britain’s on-call helicopter carrier, taking over from HMS Ocean which is currently deployed east of Suez.

As well as preparing Illustrious’ ship’s company for any travails they might encounter, the seven weeks in the hands of the world-renowned Flag Officer Sea Training (FOST) organisation allow Fleet Air Arm air and ground crews to conduct vital at-sea training.

In the case of 702NAS, it’s a chance to give trainee Lynx fliers a taste of operating from a warship at sea on their long path to front line duties with 815NAS.

And for the Merlins of 820NASit’s a chance to reacquaint themselves with their traditional role of operating en masse from a flat-top (with its sister unit 814NAS, 820NAShas typically been a ‘carrier squadron’).

The helicopters’ presence means Lusty’s deck is operational pretty much at all hours of the day.

The operational sea training will involve dealing with battle damage, crashes on deck, machinery fires, and tracking and destroying incoming aerial threats.

All of which is bread and butter to veterans of such training, of which there are many aboard the carrier, but there are also many in Illustrious’ ship’s company for whom this is their first taste of theFOSTexperience:

For all the sailors on board there’s undoubtedly a sense of excitement and eagerness taking Illustrious through her first operational sea training since emerging from refit a few months ago,” said Captain Jerry Kyd, the carrier’s Commanding Officer.

We will be put through a very demanding training period up until Christmas, honing our fighting skills, before we become the UK’s on-call helicopter carrier early next year.

With almost 4,500 troops deployed in Afghanistan, Germany is the third largest contributor to the ISAF mission.

Dr Fox said:

NATO forces are making progress in Afghanistan and, as lead nation in Regional Command (North), Germany’s contribution to ISAF is extremely important in ensuring this continues.

Dr zu Guttenberg and I had an extremely productive meeting here today; as key members of NATO and leading military nations in Europe, a strong German-UK defence relationship is important for both our countries’ security and stability in the wider world.

Germany recently revised its rules of engagement, which has seen them engaging further in countering the insurgency in northern Afghanistan. Welcoming the progress that the German troops have made, Dr Fox said:

Progress in Afghanistan is essential for the local population and all the coalition allies. All ISAF partners are working hard to ensure that the security conditions are in place to allow the Afghan Government to take responsibility for their own security.

The Defence Ministers were asked about a timetable for withdrawal. Dr Fox responded:

We are in agreement on the importance of setting aspirations. They provide the momentum to make further progress. By degrading the threats and increasing the capability of the Afghan forces, the conditions will be in place to enable us to bring our forces home without leaving behind a security vacuum.

In addition to their combat role, the German Armed Forces are heavily involved with training the Afghan National Security Forces. They currently contribute seven Operational Mentoring and Liaison Teams and two of the five Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Regional Command (North) where Germany is the lead nation.

Following the meeting Dr Fox said:

Dr zu Guttenberg and I discussed many issues, including, of course, Afghanistan, but also NATO and Europe. We were both agreed on the importance of NATO working together to improve ways in which it delivers capability and the need to deliver major operations like Afghanistan in the future.

Under Cougar, which is led by fleet flagship HMS Bulwark, Royal Navy warships, Royal Marines commandos and naval airpower will be training with French and Albanian maritime forces.

Midway through this exercise, Northumberland will depart the RFTG and proceed to the Middle East and Indian Ocean.

HMS Northumberland’s Commanding Officer, Commander Paddy Dowsett, said:

It takes a tremendous amount of personal and professional commitment to regenerate a warship ready for operations and I am extremely proud of my ship’s company for the work they have done in getting us to this point.

The ship’s company is rightly excited about the deployment and we are all committed to it being a success.

HMS Northumberland has come through an extensive nine-month period of regeneration, including refit, trials, numerous capability upgrades and an intensive operational sea training programme, to prepare her and her ship’s company for what lies ahead.

Northumberland is now poised for a challenging deployment in which she will be acting as part of the Royal Navy’s standing commitment in the Middle East, providing reassurance to the UK’s allies in the region, policing busy shipping lanes and carrying out maritime security and counter-piracy patrols.","Deployment of HMS Northumberland to the Middle East, Indian Ocean, and associated activities (reassurance to allies, policing, security patrols)",Other,,id25_192

Commenting on the improvements, the Captain of HM Naval Base Portsmouth, Captain Paul Lemkes (Royal Navy), said:

As the Local Service Commander responsible for the oversight of Service Families Accommodation (SFA) in the wider Portsmouth Area, I welcome the upgrade programme in the Harcourt Road area.

“The quality of the work is impressive and has made a huge difference to the quality of housing provision for the residents in Fareham. I hope that the programme can be extended to other parts of the estate in due course.”

A total of 55 Service Family Accommodation (SFA) properties are undergoing major refurbishment work at the site, where the majority of the homes are three bedroom properties. A small number of two bedroom houses are also being upgraded.

External improvements include replacement roofs and windows, as well as new external doors. New patios and replacement fencing are giving the outdoor spaces at the properties a much needed make-over as well.

Speaking about the refurbishments to her home, a resident of one of the improved Service Family properties said:

What a difference, I love my kitchen and I want to keep this nice. Even though they are older houses they now look so modern.

Kim Richardson OBE, Chair of the Naval Families Federation (NFF), added:

Report by Lorraine McBride.",Ministry of Defence,2 December 2010,"From gritty, vivid impressions of warfare in Afghanistan to sombre ‘eulogy’ portraits, emotional images of amputees and military farewells to ceremonial shots of Trooping the Colour, and exquisite culinary cooking and Service sport, there was excellence aplenty in this year’s competition.

The winning photos showed the Army as seen through soldiers’ eyes, with amateur and professional categories, and the winning images didn’t disappoint.

The prestigious title of Army Professional Photographer of the Year went to Corporal Gary Kendall, Royal Logistic Corps (RLC), who also picked up a runner-up prize for Professional Best Operational Image.

His intimate image ‘Hearts and Minds’ depicts a woman soldier, Sergeant McDowell of the Royal Military Police, clutching the hand of a small Afghan boy gripping a treasured lollipop, his face wreathed in smiles.

Corporal Kendall’s awards are an astonishing achievement given that he only graduated from photography training in April 2010.

His winning portfolio features an arresting portrait of a blue-eyed Afghan policeman graduating from the Helmand Police Training Centre in Lashkar Gah:

He caught my eye so I took a quick portrait, but in Afghanistan people love their pictures being taken and collared me every two seconds,” smiled Corporal Kendall.

Other images feature an Afghan tribal elder wheeling his bicycle through the dusty streets of Nad ‘Ali and a blind tribal elder with his young grandson, their closeness palpable.

Lieutenant Colonel Simon Jordan RLC, from HQ Land Forces, was runner-up in the amateur category for Best Operational Image for his neatly-titled ‘Lynx Effect’ capturing a dramatic birds-eye view from inside a cramped Lynx helicopter, shot on Boxing Day 2009. He described his monochrome shot taken in transit between Camp Bastion and Kandahar:

It was a cold sunny day and as I looked out I realised it was an amazing view, so I whipped my camera out.

A veteran of two Afghan tours, Lieutenant Colonel Jordan said:

On my first tour, I thought there are some crazy things going on here, I really need to take some photos, so I bought a camera and started then. The great thing about the Army is that you go to places that are so unusual to most people that the pictures just take themselves.

Video footage was honoured with its own categories and Major Tim Symonds won an award for Best Operational Video depicting life on combat logistic patrols in Afghanistan, delivering supplies across Helmand.

His stunning two-minute footage documented life behind the wheel in an Army convoy slowly snaking through the desert terrain past waterways, set to a techno soundtrack. The cultural contrast is heightened when, out of the blue, the slow journey is interrupted by gunfire.

In contrast to combat chaos, Major Richard Crawford was honoured for his ‘Trooping the Colour’ shot taken during the Colonel’s Review in June, winning the category of Amateur Best Non-Operational Image.

Your eye is drawn to a lone Household Cavalry soldier riding an immaculate ebony horse at the foot of the photograph with a vast backdrop of the parade ground behind the horseman:

I must have taken 150 images and blasted away. Some photos work and some don’t,” said Major Crawford. “I’m really chuffed.

Staff Sergeant John Hughes was named Amateur Photographer of the Year for his portfolio of six images taken on an exercise in Germany. He was inspired to take up photography after a posting to Northern Ireland in 1991, when his passion spiralled. His gritty close-up portrait of exhausted soldier Sergeant Richie Richardson on exercise speaks volumes:

You see photos of Vietnam veterans coming out of the jungle and his eyes drew me in,” said SSgt Hughes. “He looked so tired, as if he had really been through the mill.

Professional photographer Sergeant Rupert Frere was honoured twice, including for ‘Bye Bye Daddy’, capturing a sad-faced lad nestling into his soldier dad (from 16 Air Assault Brigade) moments before he departed for Afghanistan.

The professional category was won by Sergeant Steve Wood for his image ‘Amputee’, taken at a homecoming parade in Winchester.

Army driver Bombardier Peter Linley was a runner-up in the Amateur Best Non-Operational Image category with his shot of three 105mm light guns at the ‘Pageant of Power’, a motor show at Cholmondeley Castle, Cheshire.

Bombardier Linley only took up photography six months ago, when he was tasked by boss Colonel Alex Forbes to replace the dated, tired images lining their unit’s corridors:

I knew with the lighting, fireworks and colours from the guns firing, and suddenly there was a massive BOOM!” recalled Bombardier Linley. “It’s not really sunk in yet, I feel like I’ve won the lottery,” he added.

Mark Whitmore, Director of Collections at the Imperial War Museum, said:

Great photographs don’t just take themselves. [Combat] is a very challenging subject but it really does seem to bring out the best in photographers.

The museum boasts a world-class photographic collection that is a treasure trove for historians and researchers.

Prizes were awarded by the Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Peter Wall, who said:

There are some outstanding images that have taken skill and in some cases courage to capture and I congratulate them all.

Pressed later to single out an image that he admired, he pointed out the ‘eulogy’ portrait of Sergeant Craig Anderson, ‘Craigy’, by Sergeant Mike Fletcher at his studio in Lydd, Kent. Sgt Fletcher won Best Non-Operational Professional Image and Best Overall Image. General Wall said:

It has recorded very poignantly what might have been and it is a fantastic image which would capture anyone’s imagination.

Sgt Fletcher said:

I was taking portraits of guys in case the worst happened, but I also wanted to take less formal shots that they could give their wives. Infantry soldiers love going to Afghanistan and ‘Craigy’ was one of them.

It’s a real privilege because Army photographers are a talented bunch and it’s a tough competition, so it’s an honour.

General Wall said afterwards:

We see a lot of operational images which are very telling and convey tension and stress of the moment. Others strike a chord of our soldiers interacting with Afghan people.

It goes deeper than ‘hearts and minds’, it is about putting Afghan society back on its feet in a coherent way with proper governance. Images of shuras, policemen and village elders really capture what this campaign is all about, maybe more so than operational images. I think we need to remind ourselves that the Army is about a multiplicity of activities within a way of life. It is hugely impressive.","Informational (public campaigns, nudging)",Informational,,id25_194

The Lord Mayor’s Show has developed over 800 years and harks back to King John’s Charter of 1215 which decreed that the Lord Mayor of London must present himself to the sovereign on assuming office.

The UK’s military input was co-ordinated by HQ London District and included more than 30 floats from across London and further afield. These showcased the colourful variety of what the Forces do and have to offer as a career, superbly demonstrating this year’s theme of ‘Who we are, What we are, Where we are’.

Showing enormous loyalty to the show, many of the Forces supporters felt like they were back among friends, having taken part numerous times before. Out of the Service line-up, some 350 personnel, many of them reserves, have seen operational service, some of it only recently.

Indeed, members of the Royal Marines Reserve City of London have only recently returned from operations in Afghanistan, but were delighted to provide the Guard of Honour at Mansion House for the new Lord Mayor, Alderman David Wootton, who, along with the First Sea Lord and Commander 3 Commando Brigade, presented them with their HERRICK campaign medals.

Royal Marines Reservist Shaun Larkin said:

I was proud to receive my medal from the Lord Mayor. My six months in Afghanistan as a Royal Marines Reserve was an intense period, but it was a great honour to be recognised for my contribution to the protection of the country. Feeling supported by so many local communities at a remarkably prestigious event was the icing on the cake.

1475 Squadron Air Training Corps provided the Guard of Honour when the Lord Mayor returned to Mansion House at the end.

Pageantmaster Dominic Read, himself a former Army officer, said:

The show has benefited from Service support practically ever since a Standing Army was established. It is a huge privilege for us to take part, but it is fair to say that the city enormously appreciated our involvement - without the skills and expertise of our marshals, movement controllers and other forces specialists the show would not achieve such high standards, or be such a wonderful spectacle.

Also I should pay tribute to our many Service floats helping to show off the best of the Armed Services in London.

Among the many Army contributions was the Royal Yeomanry display, featuring a mix of armoured vehicles as well as 20 marching soldiers and six horses. Regimental Signals Officer Captain Paul Sparrow said:

This is an excellent chance to show off the regiment and some of the equipment we have - many of our young soldiers have been on operations and this is an opportunity to show who we are and what we do.

The RAF too was well-represented, with numerous floats in the line-up, among them one featuring 600 Squadron Royal Auxiliary Air Force. Float commander Squadron Leader Chris Green, back in the show for his 11th year, was as ever thrilled by the unique atmosphere, saying:

It is a wonderful occasion and a superb opportunity to connect with the huge public watching us and raise awareness of the RAF. With nearly 100 people taking part, we are never short of volunteers for the show.

The Royal Navy, as well as cadets from all three Services, also gave full backing. Show ‘veteran’ Lieutenant Commander Cliff Lewis, leading the London Area Sea Cadets float and the Sea Cadet Band, has been taking part ‘ever since I can remember’, and added:

Our cadets are always thrilled to participate, and it is a unique opportunity to show off to a huge public something about the Sea Cadets and how positive and motivated youngsters can be.

At the end of the show, the Lord Mayor was happy to pay further recognition to the Services when he presented the Director of Infantry’s Cutlers’ Sword to Corporal Kyle Martin from 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment.

Donated by the Cutlers Company, the annual presentation recognises the achievements of the best drummer, flautist or bugler in the British Army’s infantry regiments.

Corporal Martin joined the Army in 2005 and, after initial service as a Rifleman, he trained in drumming and fluting at the Army School of Ceremonial, being named best ‘F’ flute student. He is currently based at the Infantry Support Weapons School in Warminster:

It’s a great honour to win this award, both for me and for my regiment,” he said. “It was a great privilege to meet the Lord Mayor. I will wear the sword with enormous pride and use it to inspire any drummer aiming to be the Army’s best.",Standing Army & Service Support,Institutional,,id25_195

Report by Richard Long.,Ministry of Defence,8 June 2012,"Having returned from a challenging tour of Afghanistan last year, personnel from the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) headquarters could be forgiven for dreaming of a well-deserved break.

But, instead of resting on their laurels, the multinational soldiers are in the midst of preparing for their next major tasking which could see them deployed anywhere in the world.

From January 2013 the ARRC will assume the role of the NATO Response Force, a 12-month posting that requires the formation to provide immediate countermeasures to emerging international threats and crises.

This could include peacekeeping missions, disaster relief and defence tasks or helping to promote national stabilisation, governance and development where needed.

Planning for this vital work is already well underway and the 450-strong headquarters staff - 60 per cent of which stem from the British Army - were put through their paces during Exercise ARRCade Returner 2 last month.

The week-long training package in Staffordshire introduced the officers to some of the challenges they could face in the near future and they gained valuable experience of operating together on a grand scale:

This exercise has been a very good run out for us,” said ARRC Commander Lieutenant General James Bucknall.

The last time we deployed in the field like this was in 2009. After that it was specific training for Afghanistan, so we have had to relearn a lot of old lessons.

We have got people coming back from theatre and we now have to knit them together as a headquarters.

This exercise has illustrated how much work we still have to do, but our officers have vast individual experience and they are picking it up very well.

The serial tasked personnel with running a stabilisation campaign in a fictitious country known as Arnland. While working to achieve this goal they faced additional challenges such as IED strikes, a downed helicopter, road traffic accidents, radio disruptions and the theft of weapons:

The idea behind this is to get the relevant processes working within the headquarters,” explained Brigadier David Paterson, the ARRC’s Chief of Training.

We have to make sure our people know who they have to talk to and how they should interact with various air, maritime and [other] capabilities.

At this stage it is pretty low-level stuff but it is enough to get the thought processes flowing in the cycle.

The Gloucester-based formation faces a sterner test of its credentials in a final certification exercise later this year and Chief of Operations, Lieutenant Colonel Adam Edmunds, believes the initial training will hold them in good stead. He said:

We have a lot of people with experience of southern Afghanistan, so we need to check that the procedures we have in place are appropriate.

We need to prepare for a range of potential missions, some of which will be at the softer end of military life.

This is about familiarisation and identifying areas for further work, so it has been a worthwhile exercise.

The beauty of a headquarters like this is that there is a vast array of nationalities and military cultures. We have to harness that expertise to meet our goals.

While the officers within Headquarters ARRC were tested on their specific roles, a host of supporting units were on hand to ensure the exercise ran smoothly.

More than 80 soldiers from 22 Signal Regiment were responsible for installing telephone lines, computers and email systems ahead of the serials, before offering 24-hour technical support throughout the training:

We had to have all this ready for when the staff arrived on site,” said Lieutenant Phil Taylor. “Our aim was to make this as seamless as possible, but there are always going to be some problems.

The regiment has been learning and training for the past six months without a full deployment, and this has been our first opportunity to get out.

The lads have been tested and they have taken a great deal of job satisfaction from what they have been doing.

Elements of the ARRC Support Battalion also deployed to Staffordshire to ensure the necessary preparations were made prior to the exercise commencing.

Security checkpoints, force protection and tented accommodation were all provided by soldiers from 23 Pioneer Regiment, while Royal Logistic Corps chefs fed up to 700 troops a day. And personnel from the Royal Engineers operated and maintained 36 generators and were responsible for setting up power cables, lighting and heating:

We have had to modify some kit to make it work and it should have been a lot more comfortable than it has been,” explained Sapper Neale Baldwin. “But we will take a lot from this in terms of training value. We can reflect on what has happened and learn from it.

This is the first time we have been on this exercise. We have got a few new guys in the troop and they have never seen anything on this scale before.

The Community Covenant initiative was one of the key measures in the Armed Forces Covenant published in May 2011, which outlined the moral obligation between the Nation, the Government and the Armed Forces, and aims to improve support to the Armed Forces Community (which includes serving personnel, their families and veterans).See Related News.

The aims of the Community Covenant include:

Community Covenants have already been launched in Oxfordshire, the Vale of Glamorgan and Hampshire, and one is due to be launched in Portsmouth soon. The intention is that as many areas as possible should adopt Community Covenants.

Speaking at Catterick yesterday, Cllr Fort said:

We have worked very hard to meet the needs of the people and the military - those serving now and the veterans. North Yorkshire fully supports the Community Covenant. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to those who are prepared to put their lives at risk for our security.

Cllr McMullon said she was immensely proud of their connection to the Armed Forces and the close working relationship the Council already had with the Services and would ensure it continued into the future.

Brig Bibby said in the past the Armed Forces had been behind the wire and, as a result, were not part of the community, adding:

There have been some real challenges for us, but this Community Covenant is one of the most exciting developments in my 30 years of service and it is very much on the back of the Afghan factor.

This is one of the most important things I will do while commanding in the area. North Yorkshire County Council has been leading with this and we have been meeting for three years to get to this signing. I am extremely grateful to the County and all the districts therein. The trick now is to deliver and honour the Covenant.

All the signatories to the Covenant have pledged to meet at least once a year to review the support and services they provide under the terms of the Covenant and to upgrade and improve them wherever necessary.",Community Covenant,Welfare,Legislative,id25_197

This year over 1,200 members of the public responded to The Sun’s request to nominate those who they thought deserved a ‘Millie’ award.

The ceremony, which took place at London’s Imperial War Museum on Wednesday 15 December 2010, was hosted by Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden and supported by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales, who was in attendance on the night. The ceremony will be broadcast on ITV1 tonight.

The Prince of Wales said:

There are very few professions where you sign on knowing that, at some stage in your career, you may be asked to risk your life to ensure the success of the mission and that, someday, you may pay the ultimate price for your actions.

Despite these risks, men and women from across this country have stepped forward, and will continue to step forward, to serve in our Armed Forces.

When they do this they know, with some degree of certainty, that they may find themselves working in some of the most dangerous and demanding environments in the world - in countries some may never have heard of and most will never have visited. These men and women are, I believe, very special.

The first award of the evening was presented to Flight Lieutenant Ian Fortune from RAF Odiham who, while flying a Chinook helicopter in Afghanistan, was shot in the head while picking up American casualties.

Not realising the severity of his injury, Flt Lt Fortune flew the casualties back to Camp Bastion to ensure their safety, and in turn put his own life at risk.

Flt Lt Fortune received the Millie for Most Outstanding Airman. On receiving his award he said:

It’s fantastic, it really is. It’s a realisation that there is great public support for the Armed Forces and that they appreciate the job that we all go and do and I think it’s very hard to convey just how that really does affect us, to know that you have the support of your home nation. It makes doing our job that much easier.

When I watched the video [of the mission during which he sustained his injury], it brought a bit of a smile to my face in a way, because each time I see it, there’s a little bit of me that goes ‘you survived getting shot in the face’. I think ‘I’m still here’ and there’s a little moment when you realise you’ve just survived that.

TV presenters Holly Willoughby and Fearne Cotton presented Flt Lt Fortune with his award.

Fearne Cotton said:

It was incredible to present the award. He’s such an amazing guy and for us to even be here tonight to witness all these incredible awards, it’s the tiniest little thing that we can do, just to be here and show our appreciation and to give Ian the award.

The next award was presented by comedian Paddy McGuinness and former X Factor contestant and I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here winner Stacey Solomon to Warrant Officer Karl Ley, 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiment, Royal Logistic Corps.

WO Ley has dealt with more improvised explosive devices than any other operator in history, making safe and recovering 139 IEDs across Helmand province.

On winning the Millie for Most Outstanding Soldier, WO Ley said:

It’s brilliant and it’s humbling as well because I’ve been given this award and there are eight other teams doing exactly the same. There are more than eight teams doing it now as we speak, and in the future, although hopefully not for too long, there will be other teams doing the same.

It’s obviously a great honour to receive it, but I did nothing special so I’m collecting it on behalf of everybody.

On being hailed as a ‘record breaker’, WO Ley said:

I was steady. We did 139 in six months which sounds a lot, but it was less than one a day. Some days we’d do none and then the next day we’d do 14. They’re a bit like buses IEDs. You miss one and then loads come along afterwards!

Sergeant Keith Best, C Flight, 22 Squadron RAF, was next to be honoured when he received the ‘True Grit: Home Award’ for his part in the search and rescue operation in response to the floods in Cumbria at the end of 2009.

As the winchman on the first rescue aircraft, Sgt Best recovered 27 individuals, and during a sortie lasting 11 hours he displayed outstanding courage and determination.

Sgt Best said:

It’s a fantastic feeling and I’m absolutely elated to receive this award. I couldn’t be more proud.

TV presenters Ant and Dec gave the Millie to Sgt Best. Ant McPartlin said:

It’s great that we are able to present him with his award. We were in Australia this time last year and we always get on the websites and check the news back home and we remembered this lovely story at the time, so it’s great for us to come here and present Keith with this award tonight.

Next up, footballers Cesc Fabregas and Rio Ferdinand presented the Most Outstanding Sailor or Marine Award to Warrant Officer Class 2 Buck Ryan of 40 Commando Royal Marines.

WO2 Ryan was described as being a tower of strength in many life-threatening situations in Sangin, Afghanistan, including arriving with his Quick Reaction Team at the scene of a crashed US Black Hawk helicopter which was engulfed by flames.

WO2 Ryan and his team repeatedly entered the burning aircraft to rescue the American soldiers, despite exploding ammunition and the ferocious heat.

He rescued three of the trapped crew alive and recovered the bodies of four who had tragically perished in the fire.

The next award paid homage to the men of World War Two’s Bomber Command and their courage during their crucial role in defending the country.

The Judge’s Special Award was presented to Bomber Command by Ann Widdecombe and Forces’ sweetheart Katherine Jenkins.

Mrs Widdecombe said:

I think it means a huge amount because they did so much, it wasn’t just the Dambusters, every time there was an action Bomber Command was backing it up. Imagine D-Day with no air power.

I think people forget that it was a very vital role that they played and it is true that everybody has been so mesmerised by Dresden that all the other work hasn’t been properly recognised. It should be and now it is being.

The award for Best Reservist was presented to Squadron Leader Sarah Charters, 4626 Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron, Royal Auxiliary Air Force, for the three months she was in charge of the Emergency Department of Camp Bastion Hospital in Afghanistan at a time when admissions were greater than any previous period.

Rugby player Jonny Wilkinson presented Sdn Ldr Charters with her award in a pre-recorded video. At the event she said:

I’m absolutely amazed that I was nominated and it’s absolutely incredible. I met the two guys who were also shortlisted for the Reservist Award and I think the work they did is just fantastic. They were just so brave in the work that they were doing out in the field.

Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha presented the Heroes of Sangin Award to recognise every soldier, sailor and airman who risked their lives in Sangin against the Taliban.

Various members of different units from all three Services received the award on behalf of all Service personnel.

The Overcoming Adversity Award was presented to Corporal Andy Reid, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, who, during his deployment to Afghanistan in October, set off an IED which resulted in the loss of both of his legs and part of his right arm. His left arm and hand also suffered injury.

On receiving his award, Cpl Reid said:

It is an absolute honour just to be nominated for this award. Everyone’s deserving of an award and it is amazing to win and get the public behind you and know that they are thinking about what we do.

My rehabilitation is going really well. I can walk a mile on my legs now, depending on this English weather which can be quite tricky. I just have to keep going and push myself a bit further. I’m going to go back to camp in February and go into the Training Wing and be a senior Warrior instructor and teach people how to drive that.

Cpl Reid received his award from TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson and singer Myleene Klass.

Boxer David Haye presented the Life Saver Award to Corporal Ricky Furgusson MC of 4th Battalion The Rifles.

Cpl Furgusson was struck by an IED but not before he risked death to help rescue injured colleagues. Cpl Furgusson said:

It’s still a shock. I did my job and what I was trained to do. There’s plenty of blokes in Afghanistan now who would probably do exactly the same thing.

The award to recognise support to the Armed Forces was presented to Mr Denny Wise for his commitment to the children of servicemen and women affected by operations.

Mr Wise is involved in helping children understand various aspects of the Armed Forces to enable them to come to terms with the grief they feel on losing a parent.

International footballer and father of three David Beckham was honoured to present the award which addresses a cause very close to his own heart. Mr Beckham said:

When I went over to Afghanistan to see the guys it was very special and it’s a huge chance to recognise what they do for our country day-in and day-out. They deserve this and so much more.

My visit out to Afghanistan made me realise how ridiculously hard it must be to be away from their families.

When I went out there I met guys who were out there for up to six months and leaving their families and there were some incredible emotions that I saw and it really makes you realise how hard it must be.

Mr Beckham brought his eldest son Brooklyn to the ceremony, which he said is part of his education regarding the UK’s Armed Forces.

Mr Beckham explained:

He’s very proud to be here tonight and experience this. It makes it real for him and it makes him realise just how much these guys are putting their lives on the line. It means a lot for me and our son to be here tonight.

The last award of the evening was presented by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall to 1st Battlion The Mercian Regiment (1 MERCIAN) to recognise them as the Best Unit of 2010.

During their deployment to Afghanistan between April and October 2010, 1 MERCIAN suffered 12 killed in action and the highest number of casualties throughout 4th Mechanized Brigade. All of the soldiers of the battalion showed immense courage and self-sacrifice under the most extreme circumstances.

Presenting the award, the Prince of Wales said:

You only have to look around this room and see the array of medals to realise just how busy they have been and will no doubt continue to be.

So on behalf of a truly grateful nation we can only salute them for doing their duty whatever the circumstances or conditions. We are incredibly lucky to have them.

Report by Leigh Hamilton.",Ministry of Defence,26 November 2010,"This is the second year that proceeds from an X Factor single will be donated to the Help for Heroes charity, which works to support injured UK Service personnel, and sees perhaps the beginning of a tradition by one of the nation’s most popular TV programmes to support Britain’s Armed Forces.

This year’s single, sung by all the show’s 16 finalists, is a version of David Bowie’s 1977 song ‘Heroes’.

The first performance of the single took place on the X Factor results show on Sunday 21 November 2010 and members of the Armed Forces who have been treated at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court were in the audience to watch the show, including Lance Corporal Lewis Montague of The Black Watch, 3rd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, who said:

I was in Afghanistan and I was in a RTA [road traffic accident]. A car landed on my head. I was in a coma for 12 days, paralysed and couldn’t talk. They said I’d never walk. I’m still in rehab and I’m hoping to deploy next year. My voice is the main reason I won’t, so there’s a lot of work to do. I’m still wobbly on my legs too. I died in the ambulance twice.

LCpl Montague explained how much he appreciates the release of the X Factor single:

It’s amazing,” he said. “The morale that it provides for the lads as well as the awareness for the public, it’s a real lift. Everyone’s excited and we’re all looking forward to it. The money it pulls in will be an amazing benefit. It’s really good.

A video was also shown during the show which featured an interview with Lance Corporal Matthew Wilson from 2nd Battalion The Rifles who has benefited from the Help for Heroes charity. He said:

I was injured last year in June in southern Afghanistan by an IED and lost my left leg and severely damaged my left arm, but I’ve managed to do quite a good recovery. It’s gone really well to be honest.

I spent eight weeks in Selly Oak Hospital and then did 12 months at Headley Court to get myself back fighting fit. The rehab is really hard work, but you get out of it what you put into it basically. The centre itself is brilliant. The care, the physios are great.

On the support he’s received from Help for Heroes and his appearance on the X Factor, LCpl Wilson said:

They are such an amazing charity, not just for the charitable work, but for getting the whole country to rally in support of the troops as well as the over £80m that they’ve raised now to put towards helping people.

If you’d told me 12 months ago that I’d be sitting here having done a video for the X Factor I would have laughed at you!

As well as meeting the troops present at Sunday’s show, some of the X Factor contestants visited Headley Court earlier in the week where they met injured Service personnel including Warrant Officer Class 2 Ken Bellringer from 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Regiment, Royal Logistic Corps. He said:

I was in Afghanistan on HERRICK 10 going into HERRICK 11 and I was an EOD operator responsible for rendering safe improvised explosive devices. On this one particular occasion I dealt with a single explosive device, found a couple more, and needed to get my team somewhere safe. One of my guys had got stuck and as I went to pull him out there was an almighty explosion. Unfortunately he was killed and I lost my legs and full use of my hands.

Everything just slows down massively. I knew I was in the air and I knew it was going to hurt when I landed; I knew what had happened straight away as I had dealt with so many explosive device explosions. I knew my legs had gone missing and I just had my eyes tightly shut.

I just remember thinking ‘I hope the lads come and find me. I hope they don’t leave me here’. I was blacking in and out. This was on November 15th and I didn’t wake up until the 23rd of December.

Of his rehabilitation at Headley Court WO2 Bellringer said:

The rehab has been hard, especially on my family. I’m married and I’ve got two young kids and it’s been particularly hard on them just trying to live their lives while still coming to visit me and all the worry that’s associated with. As far as the treatment goes, when I was in Selly Oak things went quite well and I had a few operations.

There have been major improvements in Headley Court. My hands are damaged, I lost my thumbs in the explosion, so we’re just trying to get the ball rolling and it will take up to five years to get me fully rehabilitated.

On the X Factor charity single, one of the show’s judges, music mogul Louis Walsh, said:

It was Simon’s [Cowell] idea. It’s a great song and it’s a good thing to do. They’re great people; I just met some of them inside and it’s a brilliant idea and it’s a brilliant song as well. I think we’ll be number one!

Favourite to win the show, X Factor contestant Matt Cardle, said:

It’s so important to do it because the guys are out there risking life and limb for their country. It’s a great song choice and we’re all just so happy and honoured to be involved in it. It’s very emotional - it’s a very special song.

We went down to Headley Court and the work that goes on there is just incredible. The guys and girls out in Afghanistan are absolutely the real heroes. The work they do puts things into perspective and when you see these people and the positivity that they have it is just amazing.

Liam Payne from boyband One Direction, the show’s only surviving group, said:

We’re on a TV show and they’re putting their lives on the line. We feel scared to go out on stage in front of millions of people but I’m sure that none of us could even step foot in these guys’ treads, so it’s pretty amazing.

We met loads of guys at Headley Court, but the people who really struck me were the guys of my age who were injured soldiers. It was a weird way to think of it; they’re my age doing things like that and fair play to them because I don’t think any of us lads could do it. They’re such brave people, made of strong stuff.

X Factor singer Katie Waissel added:

It’s such a massive deal and I’m so appreciative to be a part of this and so excited to be a part of it. For me, I’m hoping that this is the beginning of a beautiful journey with the charity. I’d love to and can’t wait to do so much more with Help for Heroes.

I think the guys are incredible and they’re such wonderfully spirited people and meeting them puts things into perspective 110 per cent. It puts life into perspective. They are the true heroes, they’re real heroes.

In Mr Parton’s words, EJ has given him back a quality of life after losing the use of his legs in an explosion during the war in Iraq:

EJ is able to put a cash card into a cash machine or in a chip and pin machine in a supermarket, he will press the button at traffic lights, post letters for me - and can put me in the recovery position if I collapse, and get help.

Mr Parton spent five years undergoing hospital treatment and attempted suicide twice. He also has short-term memory loss - so much so that immediately after the injury he could not remember that he was married or had two children.

He could not write, walk or talk, but through the love of his family (he remarried his wife four years ago as he could not remember the original wedding) and EJ, Mr Parton is now raising money to train up more dogs like EJ to help other Service personnel who have been injured.

And, at RAF Brize Norton, personnel from 99 Squadron were on hand to give the Hounds for Heroes charity a boost.

The charity’s initial aim is to raise £100,000 for the purchase, training and support of its first five dogs - under its Puppies on Parade Appeal.

A team of trustees from Hounds for Heroes, as well as EJ and another assistance dog Ikea, toured around 99 Squadron’s aircraft, including a C-17 and TriStar jets.

The noise from such an environment could unnerve lesser dogs, but those from Hounds for Heroes have been trained to cope with unknown environments and sounds.

Mr Parton, who served in the Royal Navy and was the face of the Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal two years ago, said:

EJ can take stuff off a supermarket shelf, put them in a shopping basket and take them out again.

If I fall unconscious he will put me in the recovery position, cover me with a blanket and either hit the emergency phone or open a window and bark for help - or leave the house and go and get help.

Anything is possible with these dogs. When dogs like EJ are trained they will give injured Service personnel a much better quality of life.

EJ is named after Mr Parton’s first assistance dog Endal who Mr Parton describes as being the ‘best physical and psychological rehabilitation I could have ever received’. Endal was awarded the Dickin Medal, which is the equivalent of a Victoria Cross for animals.

So inspiring is Mr Parton’s story that a best-selling book has been written about it, and a film looks set to be made about his life.

After the visit to RAF Brize Norton, Hounds for Heroes Chief Executive Officer, Squadron Leader Wayne Palmer, said:

This has been a great day and we feel we have a lot of synergy with 99 Squadron.

They are one of the first parts of the healing process and we will be the last part. Our aim is to have the perception of the great British public change and see an assistance dog as a badge of honour.

We look forward to the day that a ‘Hound’ is on the annual remembrance parade by the Cenotaph in London.

That brief glimpse into the world of the red and grey Sea Kings prompted the Blue Peter team to produce a more detailed feature on the work of Search and Rescue helicopters.

Six months later, Helen and her camera crew travelled to the Cornish air station, with the presenter trying on an aircrewman’s role for size.

Helen is no stranger to challenges, having paddled a kayak the 2,000-mile (3,220-kilometre) length of the Amazon River, tightrope walked across Battersea Power Station, and cycled and skied to the South Pole.

Fully kitted out in flying overalls, squadron badges, helmet and life jacket, Helen was taught the basics of flying and navigation, and the instructors had enough confidence in Helen to take her out in on a training mission.

The four-man crew and Helen were scrambled to airlift a casualty who had been pulled out of the water by the RNLI (Royal National Lifeboat Institution).

When the Royal Navy team arrived on scene, the Blue Peter presenter was winched down on to the lifeboat where she was ‘tasked’ to recover the ‘casualty’ and help the crew to ‘rescue’ the individual by winching him up into the helicopter.

Helen was a great student and a fast learner,” said observer Lieutenant Commander Rob ‘Smoke’ Suckling. “She took the debrief points on board from the first day, and I was happy for her to be supervised carrying out a boat winch on day two.

I think she got a real insight into the technical aspects of the winchman’s job, and experienced a little of it first-hand.

You can see how Helen fares when Blue Peter is broadcast at 1745hrs (BST) on Thursday 12 April 2012 on CBBC - or at 1630hrs on Friday 13 April 2012 when the show is repeated on BBC1.

This is the latest measure to be announced following the Government’s commitment, given last year, to upholding the Armed Forces Covenant and the measure is consistent with the principles of the Covenant.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said:

I am delighted that in addition to tax-free payments from the MOD’s Armed Forces Compensation Scheme, seriously injured serving personnel and veterans will also be able to avoid the unnecessary duplication of reassessments and receive disability benefits via these new arrangements. These brave individuals have served their country with honour and it is only right and proper that they receive financial support to help them with injuries caused by their service.

Recognising the considerable sacrifice made by a number of courageous members of the Armed Forces who have been injured as a result of their service, the Government has decided to put in place special arrangements for these personnel to help them cover the ongoing costs of their injury.

Rather than face separate assessments these individuals will automatically be entitled to payments to help with the additional costs associated with their injuries. Eligibility for these payments will be linked to their Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) award and the payments will provide financial reassurance for the future.

Those currently in receipt of an AFCS award for serious injury and in receipt of Disability Living Allowance (DLA) will also benefit from the arrangements.

MOD and DWP have worked together to ensure that those who receive an award for a serious injury from the AFCS will continue to receive at least the amount they are currently receiving under DLA. In addition, those with future compensation awards will also receive the new payments.

The Armed Forces Covenant sets out two key principles – that members of the Armed Forces Community should face no disadvantage compared with other citizens and that special consideration is appropriate in some cases, especially those who have given most such as the injured and bereaved.

The course breaks down traditional boundaries by delivering surgical trauma training to entire surgical teams, with general, orthopaedic and plastic surgeons training alongside anaesthetists, operating department practitioners, theatre nurses and emergency physicians. The course utilises the state-of-the-art clinical simulation facilities and specialist surgical training staff at the Education Centre of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.

Tutors with recent military operational experience and live links to surgeons in Afghanistan mean that training is up-to-date and based on real-life encounters on the battlefield, and ensures that the learning curve for teams, once deployed, is minimal.

The course won the Education and Training Award at last night’s Military and Civilian Health Partnership Awards which were held in Belfast. The awards are a partnership between the Ministry of Defence and the Health Departments of Northern Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales.

Surgeon Captain Mark Midwinter, Defence Professor of Surgery at ADMST, and MOST course convenor, said:

I am absolutely delighted that MOST has won the award for Education and Training. The course is based on the idea that it is unacceptable to have a learning curve in delivering surgical trauma care to the wounded in the field.

We teach surgical teams how to deliver the best possible outcome for patients, rather than purely focusing on individual task-specific training. It is vital to get surgical teams working together seamlessly to deliver the optimal decision making, resuscitation, operative and post-operative care.

MOST uses military equipment and treatment protocols to ensure complete familiarisation before deploying. I have no doubt that this method of training is saving lives.

John Black, President of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said:

Surgeons currently deployed in Afghanistan face the daily task of treating military personnel suffering severe, complex injuries from bomb blasts or gunshot wounds - injuries they are likely to have limited experience of dealing with in NHS hospitals.

MOST plays a very necessary part in ensuring that surgical teams about to deploy to Afghanistan are as prepared as possible for the work they are likely to be exposed to on a tour of duty.

There are nine categories in the awards covering the wide range of skills that health and social care personnel exhibit.

Other military winners were: Out of Hours Treatment in British Forces Germany, which won the Innovation and Service Development Award; RAF Lincolnshire and Phoenix Stop Smoking Network, which won the Health Improvement and Promotion Award; Lieutenant Colonel Alisdair MacMillan, who won the Healthcare Reservist of the Year Award; Major Russ Parkes, who won the Healthcare Regular of the Year Award; State-of-the-Art Prosthetics, which won the Care of Veterans Award; and Trauma Inoculation Programmes, which won the Deployed Healthcare Award.

The Surgeon General, Surgeon Vice Admiral Philip Raffaelli, said:

The medical personnel who serve our Armed Forces share the same dangers as those they support on the front line. I am proud that these awards give them, together with the military medical personnel working in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system, the recognition that they rightly deserve.

I work with a dedicated team who are constantly pioneering life-saving medical advances, which mean that those injured in service to their country receive the very best care available.

Working closely with our partners in the NHS we are constantly improving the care that we provide and the awards are a reflection of the highest levels of clinical excellence that support our Armed Forces. They deserve nothing less.",MOST course,Other,Legislative,id25_204

She also supported NATO aircraft by firing star shells into the sky, illuminating for them Gaddafi forces’ rocket launchers, fuel dumps, ammo stores, artillery batteries and command and control centres.

Before her Libya tasking, HMS Iron Duke had covered nearly 38,000 nautical miles, visiting eight countries, and working directly with more than 250 vessels from countries across the world.

Iron Duke’s primary role after leaving Portsmouth in January was on Operation ACTIVE ENDEAVOUR – working with international navies to combat smuggling and human trafficking in support of counter-terrorism.

HMS Iron Duke then sailed to the Gulf, where she performed the final patrol of the Al Basrah oil terminal following eight years of Royal Navy presence there.

Her task was to protect the platform and provide support and reassurance to the surrounding fisherman and trade vessels.

Combined with Iron Duke’s operational tasking has been a raft of high-profile engagements and port visits. In particular, the ship played a key part in the Kuwait ‘50-20’ celebrations, commemorating 50 years of independence, and 20 years since the liberation from Saddam Hussein’s regime.

HMS Iron Duke demonstrated the flexibility of Royal Navy warships by racing to the aid of a Korean fisherman in the Gulf of Oman who was badly injured after a wire broke free and struck him in the face.

Commanding Officer of HMS Iron Duke, Commander Nick Cooke-Priest, said:

It is impossible to capture or articulate the full range of emotions, occurrences, complexities and challenges that are inherent in naval deployments, but success is generally optimised through commitment, courage and teamwork.

In Iron Duke, it has been my enormous privilege to lead a team that delivered those essential attributes in spades, always accompanied by a willingness to deliver at the optimum standard, and always with a ready smile.

Fellow Type 23 frigate HMS Richmond’s tasks have been no less varied. She has been on a seven-month deployment that has seen the ship operating as far east as Brunei, and as far south as the Seychelles, deep into the Indian Ocean.

After leaving Portsmouth in January, Richmond spent two months on counter-piracy missions off the Horn of Africa. The embarked Royal Marine and Royal Navy boarding teams investigated suspicious vessels and reassured fishermen and local dhows with their presence.

On top of the counter-piracy tasking, HMS Richmond escorted a cargo vessel carrying humanitarian aid from the UN’s World Food Programme into Somalia – providing the hungry with nine-million meals.

The frigate then made a series of port stops at Salalah in Oman, Djibouti, and the Seychelles, where the ship provided expert advice on piracy and gave engineering support to the Seychelles Coastguard - key partners in fighting piracy in the region. The visit coincided with the International Carnival of the Sea; primarily designed to advertise the Seychelles as a tourist and business attraction on the world stage with warships from Russia and India also present.

Next stop was to Singapore, and then Changi Naval Base for the International Maritime Defence Exhibition; where HMS Richmond provided a ‘floating sales platform’ to help UK-based companies secure vital export contracts into the region.

While in the area, HMS Richmond led a major military exercise called Bersama Shield, with participants from the Five Powers Defence Agreement (FPDA) nations of Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand. The exercise was concentrated mainly in the South China Sea, close to the Malaysian coast, with a total of nine warships and dozens of combat aircraft taking part in numerous scenarios.

A visit to the Sultanate of Brunei on the Island of Borneo represented the ship’s final stop in the Far East. The visit was timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces, and culminated in a large military tattoo. From Brunei, the ship headed westward to the Maldives, stopping briefly at Menorca to help commemorate 300 years since the building of the Royal Navy hospital on the Isla del Rey.

HMS Richmond’s Commanding Officer, Captain Mike Walliker, said:

I am delighted to bring HMS Richmond and all her crew safely home after a demanding seven-month operational tour. My ship’s company are extremely proud of the contribution we have made to countering piracy, feeding the starving in Somalia and promoting the UK’s interests in the Far East.",Counter-piracy missions off the Horn of Africa,Other,,id25_205

She can embark 60 troops and their equipment, supported by a modern medical facility that can deliver a surgical capability. She could also carry up to 700 people to support a civilian evacuation.

The Defence Secretary, Dr Liam Fox, said:

The Type 45 programme is an example of how we are investing in capabilities for the future. This ceremony marks another step in the delivery of six of the most powerful air defence destroyers ever built for the Royal Navy. These new ships will provide the UK with a world class military capability that will form a key part of the Future Force 2020.

Hundreds of guests including families of the 190-strong ship’s company attended the ceremony at Portsmouth Naval Base which was conducted by the Reverend Scott Brown, Chaplain of the Fleet.

During the ceremony the ship’s sponsor, Lady Johns, who launched the ship at BAE Systems’ Govan shipyard on the River Clyde in November 2007, inspected the members of the ship’s company on parade.

HMS Diamond’s Commanding Officer, Commander Ian Clarke, read out a Commissioning Warrant and the ceremony was rounded off in traditional Royal Navy fashion with the cutting of a commissioning cake.

Performing the honour was the Commanding Officer’s wife Joanne and Engineering Technician Ross Hindmarch, who, at 17, is the youngest member of the ship’s company.

Commander Clarke said:

This is a proud moment for all on board HMS Diamond. As she nears the end of her trials phase, this ceremony marks our transition to front line service.

Thereafter, the emphasis will be on combat readiness in preparation for our first deployment next year. I’m thrilled that so many families, friends and affiliates, some from overseas, were part of our momentous day.

All the Type 45s will be based in Portsmouth. The first, HMS Daring, was commissioned in July 2009, followed by HMS Dauntless in June last year.

Law enforcement agencies are now able to use the new tools and modernised powers to deter, detect and disrupt threats from those acting on behalf of foreign states against the UK and its interests.

For the first time, it is an offence to be an undeclared foreign spy materially assisting the activities of a foreign intelligence service in the UK. Anyone caught carrying out such offences can be charged and prosecuted.

The threat to the UK has evolved in recent years and Russia, China and Iran have all posed acute threats to the UK, through interference, poisonings and attempted kidnappings. This act makes it even more difficult for such activity to be undertaken on UK soil.

Home Secretary, James Cleverly, said:

There are foreign powers who have shown their willingness to make threats to the UK and our freedoms. The National Security Act will prove critical in helping police and intelligence partners to make it even more difficult for them to do so, and as the core measures come in to force today, the UK becomes a safer country.

We will always do everything possible to protect the United Kingdom.

Further activities which can now be put before the UK courts includes updated espionage offences, including the theft of trade secrets, foreign interference, including in the UK’s political system, sabotage, and modern ways of attempting to access the UK’s most sensitive sites.

Deputy Prime Minister, Oliver Dowden, said:

The National Security Act is the most significant reform of espionage law in a century and demonstrates that the Government will always act to protect the UK from threats to our security, prosperity and interests.

State threats are an evolving challenge and the new offences and powers in the National Security Act will ensure that our intelligence services and law enforcement have the tools they need to counter them.

The act has brought into effect modern laws to tackle such threats, replacing previous espionage legislation that was primarily designed to counter the threat from German spies before and after the First World War.

Security Minister, Tom Tugendhat, said:

The UK has been facing a rise in foreign state-directed threats with various attempts to harm our citizens – we have not stood back but have created a new set of powers to confront it.

Our new national security laws can now be applied, and those who would seek to undermine our democracy can be held to account.

These new tools will protect us and hold all malign foreign actors responsible for any threatening activity.

The new tools available to operational partners will also provide the means to stop those seeking by illegitimate means to influence public figures.

It will also improve the process for the use of existing powers within the Counter Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019, which grant police officers the ability to stop individuals at ports and retain items that could ascertain their involvement in hostile activity by foreign states.

Head of Counter-Terrorism Police, Matt Jukes, said:

The National Security Act means that UK policing will have the modern day practical powers required to detect, disrupt, deter, and prosecute those who seek to undermine our freedom and values.

It will also ensure that policing continues to play an integral role in protecting our communities from the threats posed by hostile state actors.

The act introduces specific powers to help law enforcement take action against, and obtain evidence in relation to, those acting on behalf of foreign states against the UK and its interests. This could include, for example, those who aid a foreign power by distributing information which has been illegally obtained through cyber espionage. The new powers include enhanced arrest and detention powers and a modernised search warrant power, containing improved safeguards.

Further areas of the National Security Act will come into force at a later stage. This includes the Foreign Influence Registration Scheme, which aims to strengthen the resilience of the UK political system against covert foreign influence, and is expected to come into force in 2024.

The speech focused on operations in Afghanistan and Dr Fox told the audience that the operations of NATO and other coalition allies in Afghanistan are a direct consequence of 9/11.

Dr Fox said that in Afghanistan Britain stands shoulder-to-shoulder with America and shoulder-to-shoulder too with the 44 other nations who have troops on the ground there as well as the Afghan Government and ordinary Afghan people.

See Related Links to read the speech in full.

The close co-operation between the UK and the US was in further evidence during the Secretary of State’s visit to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center where he spoke with injured Service personnel who have recently returned to the US from Afghanistan and Iraq.

Talking to the patients and staff, Dr Fox said:

We must learn from each other’s best practice so that we can develop a gold standard for the treatment of our Armed Forces and veterans. This is why, on my first visit as Defence Secretary to Washington DC, I have visited the Walter Reed Army Medical Center.

Our brave Armed Forces are paying a high price defending national security which is why both the UK and the US Governments are committed to providing the best quality of care and rehabilitation to our injured Service personnel.

This medical establishment is a shining example of that commitment and sets the standards for the UK to match in terms of quality clinical services.

The new Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham already brings together on one site key clinical services used by Service personnel at Selly Oak Hospital such as orthopaedics, neurosurgery, neurology, burns, plastic surgery and critical care. For those military patients who often need the care and expertise of several different clinical teams to treat their injuries this will be a particularly welcome benefit.

During his tour of the medical centre, Dr Fox sat down and spoke with injured Service personnel who have recently returned to the US from Afghanistan and Iraq. He expressed his admiration for their courage and fortitude:

It is always humbling to speak to such brave people who have given so much for their country. The work they do is vital for national security. The UK Government has pledged to provide the very best in through-life care for those UK troops injured in service to their country. Our commitment to them is a commitment for life.

Before he left the medical facility Dr Fox praised the staff and those who run the centre and stressed the need for continued close working relationships:

Like the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, the Walter Reed Army Medical Center brings together the highest standards of clinical excellence with military support, not just for the casualties but also for their families.

Dr Fox also met with the US Secretary of Veterans Affairs, General Eric Shinseki, to talk about the mental healthcare of veterans. After their discussions, Dr Fox said:

There is already a significant level of collaboration between our two countries for treating wounded Service personnel and this meeting provided an opportunity to discuss what more could be done.

The US and UK have a range of ongoing research from surgical training on military fractures in San Antonio to military mental health projects looking at Reserve Forces’ families and children of military parents. Such collaboration is vital to ensuring we provide the highest ongoing care for our people.

I welcome this opportunity to learn more about what works well in the United States. Veterans’ mental healthcare is a high priority for me personally and the UK Government is currently working with the charity Combat Stress, the Department of Health and the NHS [National Health Service] to identify measures which will support veterans’ access to treatment.

The effectiveness of screening for mental health problems also formed part of the discussion. Dr Fox said:

We are exploring the benefits of screening and Dr Andrew Murrison MP, a former Royal Navy Surgeon Commander, is conducting a study on behalf of the Prime Minister on the relationship between the Armed Forces (including veterans) and the NHS, focusing particularly on mental health. There are also plans for a trial, which will provide a major part of the evidence base for assessing whether screening would be appropriate in the UK.","Collaboration between UK and US governments on veteran care and mental healthcare, including research, screening, and a trial.",Institutional,Other,id25_208

She will be conducting maritime security patrols - policing and protecting islanders living in the British Overseas Territories.

Over the last few months the ship’s company have been put through their paces with operational sea training from January to April 2011, and the ship has gone through a pre-deployment maintenance period to ensure she is ready to deploy.

HMS Edinburgh also put her Sea Dart missile system to the test and fired several missiles on the Royal Navy’s Hebrides firing range.

Her Commanding Officer, Commander Paul Russell, said:

Since emerging from refit last year, through trials and operational training, Edinburgh’s team has been focused on this deployment to the South Atlantic, a region of high profile, political and joint military interest where the Royal Navy has had a continuous and significant effect over many years.

I am delighted with my ship’s company’s response to recent training and am hugely grateful for the first rate engineering support provided by Portsmouth Naval Base to ensure we sail in a safe and sustainable material state.

Our families deserve a very special mention and thanks too as they have been the very cornerstone of strength for us all throughout a hugely demanding period of regeneration.

By sheer distance from the UK, and in the face of a harsh South Atlantic winter, the deployment will present real operational challenges for us all, but this will be balanced by the visits to some wonderfully diverse countries and the opportunity for the Royal Navy to demonstrate its impressive global reach and versatility.

But, stuck on a tiny ledge as the tide came in, they suddenly found they were cut off up the cliff as waves crashed around their feet.

People in the immediate vicinity, who witnessed the unfolding drama from the shore, raised the alarm, and, with lifeboats unable to reach them, a rescue helicopter was called in from Chivenor in Devon.

Co-pilot of the RAF Sea King Mk3A helicopter, Flight Lieutenant John Rowe, said:

The teenagers were trapped at the bottom of the cliff and the incoming tide had cut them off. When we arrived, Llantwit Major cliff rescue teams and Porthcawl lifeboats were already at the scene. But we were the quickest way of getting them out.

“The group had climbed up to a cliff ledge, which was the highest point they could get to - around 20 feet [6m] above seawater, which was where we found them.”

Winchman Sergeant Rachel Robinson, fresh out of training with the Operational Conversion Unit at RAF Valley, was sent down to rescue the teenagers (including a guitar that belonged to one of them) in only her second operation.

Describing the difficulty of the mission Flight Lieutenant Rowe said:

It wasn’t too difficult, a relatively simple job of about three out of 10. It was a nice day with no bad weather conditions, just a bit of a crosswind. Rachel was the winchwoman so we got them up two at a time in the aircraft to safety. She coped absolutely admirably.

The teenagers, who all came from Cardiff, said they were ‘cold but scared’. The RAF team dropped them off unharmed at the top of the cliff, leaving them with the Swansea Coastguard:

Fortunately, it was quite a benign rescue,” said Flight Lieutenant Rowe, adding, “cliff-top call-outs are not unusual. We go to quite a few. Getting cut off by the tide is surprisingly common and Search and Rescue probably get called out once a week.

The Royal Air Force maintains a 24-hour Search and Rescue (SAR) service covering the whole of the United Kingdom and a large surrounding area. Whilst the service exists primarily to assist military aircrew and other personnel in distress, the vast majority of ‘scrambles’ are to assist civilians who find themselves in difficulties, either on land or at sea.

RAF Sea King helicopters of 22 and 202 Squadrons operate from six UK locations. Further helicopters provide SAR cover from two Royal Navy and four Maritime and Coastguard Agency contract-operated bases, giving a total of 12 helicopter units around the UK.

Amongst those helping to teach skiing to the 11 disabled servicemen on the two-week exercise in Wertach, Bavaria, were Chief Petty Officer Archie Gemmell and Flight Lieutenant Steph Groves.

CPO Gemmell and Flt Lt Groves completed training and a refresher course alongside other instructors at Haus Magnus in Wertach, Drei Muhlen Lodge run by Adventurous Training Group (Army), and on the ski slopes of Oberjoch, Fellhorn and Nebelhorn, high up in the Bavarian Mountains.

Although the Naval Outdoor Lodge and the RAF Alpine Training Centre are close by in Oberstdorf, the facilities in Drei Muhlen have been adapted for disabled personnel and hence the Army runs the adaptive skiing exercise on behalf of the three Services.

Troops with a mix of combat injuries from operational theatres, including a triple amputee and two double-leg amputees, embarked on the exercise alongside non-combat injured personnel, such as those suffering neurological trauma from road accidents.

Adaptive skiing is split into a variety of disciplines according to the type and level of impairment the student has to deal with.

For those students with lower limb loss or a disability affecting their legs a ‘sit ski’ is used, which involves a seat attached to a frame incorporating either a single ski or an articulated pair of skis on the base. The student uses either two outriggers on the frame or adapted elbow crutches with mini skis on the bottom to maintain balance, so they can participate on the widest range of slopes alongside everybody else.

Flight Lieutenant Steph Groves and Chief Petty Officer Archie Gemmell with an adaptive skier [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]

Three-track skiing is where one leg and adapted crutches (resulting in three tracks in the snow) are used and four-track skiing involves use of a prosthetic leg and adapted crutches to leave four tracks in the snow. Some skiers without limb loss, but who have other injuries including neurological impairment, may also ski four-track.

As most of the students had not skied before, CPO Gemmell and Flt Lt Groves were put to the test, but their backgrounds and training meant they were well-equipped to teach their students all they needed to know.

CPO Gemmell qualified as a Joint Forces ski instructor in 2000 and further enhanced his qualifications and skills when he and his wife Debs travelled to the Rocky Mountains in Canada in 2008 to undertake the Canadian instructors’ qualification.

Having initially learnt to ski before joining the Royal Navy, CPO Gemmell has been to numerous Royal Navy ski championships over the years and intends, having attended Exercise Snow Warrior as an Adaptive Assistant this year, to apply for the instructor course next ski season. CPO Gemmell said:

Whilst in Canada qualifying as a Canadian ski instructor I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work with an adaptive skier for a few days. Knowing how much pleasure and freedom this gives the individual, when the opportunity arose to come out as an Assistant with Exercise Snow Warrior (Adaptive), I jumped at the opportunity.

I was honoured to be given the chance to spend time with an amazing bunch of people all with the same passion, grabbing life and enjoying every moment. Skiing is a great leveller of ability and allows anyone with or without a disability to be treated as an equal.

Flt Lt Groves was a Physical Training Instructor in the Royal Navy before commissioning into the RAF as a Medical Support Officer two years ago.

Having served with the Navy in a number of places including Scotland, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Gibraltar, Kuwait and Northern Ireland, she is now serving as Business Manager for the 15 Regional Rehabilitation Units staffed at HQ Air Command, and because of her contact with injured personnel became involved with the Battle Back scheme.

Having learnt to ski through the Navy she decided to take her skiing to a new level and has attended Exercise Snow Warrior (Adaptive) for five years as an Assistant. Like CPO Gemmell, she now intends to attend the instructor course next ski season. She said:

To be able to participate and assist in an Exercise Snow Warrior is an honour. The experience is incredibly humbling but also uplifting in allowing able-bodied personnel to view at first hand the difficulties those living with disability face on a daily basis.

I don’t believe we can ever understand how hard it is when even to shower and dress becomes a challenge. The students taking part not only ‘Battle Back’ in their normal activities of daily life but somehow find the strength to undertake new challenges.

Skiing, in any form, is mentally and physically challenging and the achievements of the students are awe-inspiring. However, it must be remembered that the skiing is only part of the challenge of this exercise.

Travelling with enormous disability brings its own issues as does different accommodation and messing facilities.

Having taken part in a number of these exercises previously I take a rather less narrow view of life on my return, looking much more to the positive, challenging side of life rather than getting drawn into minor issues.

Battle Back is an MOD-led initiative in partnership with and funded by both the Royal British Legion and Help for Heroes.

This advice will now be considered in full by Department of Health and Social Care ministers before any policy decisions are made on any new routine immunisation programmes. Should the advice be accepted, operational detail of how the vaccine will be delivered will follow.

TheJCVI’s advice on gonorrhoea says that a targeted vaccination programme should use the 4CMenB vaccine for the prevention of gonorrhoea. The MenB vaccine is currently used in the routine childhood programme for the prevention of meningococcal disease (meningitis and septicaemia).

Meningococcal disease (Neisseria meningitidis) and gonorrhoea (Neisseria gonorrhoeae) are closely genetically related, with evidence showing that MenB vaccine provides some cross-protection against gonorrhoea.

In reviewing the evidence, theJCVInoted that even with the modest vaccine documented effectiveness against gonorrhoea (between 32.7% to 42%) many cases of gonorrhoea could be prevented. It was also noted that the disease itself doesn’t protect from infection and affected individuals are commonly reinfected.

TheJCVIconsidered the evidence presented in terms of programme cost-effectiveness and likely impact on the incidence of gonorrhoea.

While the main benefit of a vaccination programme is expected to be at a community level with a significant reduction in the number of cases overall, vaccinated individuals could expect to have some reduction in their own risk of contracting gonorrhoea.

Professor Andrew Pollard, Chair of theJCVI, said:

Introducing a MenB vaccination programme to prevent gonorrhoea in England would be a world first and should significantly help to reduce levels of gonorrhoea, which are currently at a record high.

In addition, we are advising setting up a routine targeted mpox offer – to prevent a repeat of the large outbreak we saw in early 2022. Both vaccinations should be offered to those at highest risk.

Katy Sinka, Head of Sexually Transmitted Infections atUKHSA, said:

A vaccination programme to impact on gonorrhoea cases would be a hugely welcome intervention to ensure we are better prepared to address this increasing threat. We saw a rapid rise last year with more cases than ever before and with gonorrhoea becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, tackling this infection is a serious concern.

And while mpox case numbers across England remain very low, we should not be complacent. Any routine vaccination offer to those at highest risk of infection will help ensure we remain on top of the disease and prevent any major future outbreaks.

TheJCVIadvises that a vaccination programme against gonorrhoea should primarily target gay and bisexual men and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM), who have the highest rates of gonorrhoea.

While a disproportionate number of gonorrhoea cases are withinGBMSM, this doesn’t cover the entire cohort at higher risk.JCVIadvises that efforts should be made to ensure that the vaccine is offered to those at equivalent risk, including other individuals who may be heterosexual or identify otherwise.

The eligibility advice for a routine mpox programme would be for an opportunistic offer toGBMSMat higher risk of mpox infection.

As with all immunisation advice, theJCVIwill keep this under review and the programme costs and benefits, and eligibility may be reassessed as further information about vaccine effectiveness and duration of protection becomes available.

The improvements …",Ministry of Defence,17 June 2010,"The properties are being refurbished inside and out, bringing them up to modern standards and meeting environmental needs. The improvements include new kitchens, new bathrooms with showers, improved storage space and better insulation. As well as being fully redecorated, the homes are getting new curtains, carpets and flooring.

Further improvements include replacement roofs, new heating and electrics, and walls being moved to create more spacious rooms. Windows are being replaced along with internal and external doors. All of the work aims to give Service families the comfort and safety they expect.

Air Commodore Elaine West, Head of DE Operations Housing, said:

Defence Estates’ top priority is supporting our Armed Forces and their families. Like all our projects, what we are delivering at RAF Halton is terribly important and goes beyond the planning, building work and money invested.

Indeed, having spoken to occupants, these refurbishments are already making a real difference to Service families who are thoroughly enjoying their new homes.

RAF Halton Station Commander, Group Captain Garry Tunnicliffe, added:

I am pleased to have seen, first hand, the investment that has gone into RAF Halton quarters. The refurbishment is of a significantly high standard; a standard, that in the future, will be measured throughout the wider defence community.

The Halton upgrade project is being managed on behalf of DE by MODern Housing Solutions (MHS). So far 12 properties have been completed, 10 of which are now occupied. It is expected that the project will deliver all 83 upgraded homes by February 2011.

Air Commodore West and RAF Halton Station Commander Group Captain Garry Tunnicliffe recently met with some of the families who have already moved into their new homes.

They had an opportunity to view the significant improvements made and talk to residents, some of whom described the homes as like “moving into a new property”.

Anna Allan, married to Flight Lieutenant Robert Allan based at the Station and mother of two young twins, recently moved into her upgraded Service home. She said:

You feel really valued when you walk through the door. It is a perfect house for a family. Living in this refurbished house with no ongoing maintenance concerns means that life is stress free and hassle free. That’s exactly what you need as a Service family.

Corporal Alan Davies, who has recently moved into his upgraded Service home, added:

The house is fantastic, the wife loves it! It’s so much fresher; it makes you want to make an effort to make it into your own home.

In the last financial year, DE has fully upgraded around 900 Service family homes with more modest refurbishments to many more.",Full upgrade of 900 Service family homes,Welfare,,id25_214

The award is given to the unit or establishment of each Service judged to have made the most valuable contribution to humanitarian activities by establishing good and friendly relations with the inhabitants of any community at home or overseas.,Ministry of Defence,26 October 2012,"A small team from 15 POG has been continuously deployed to Helmand for six years. Working predominantly with the Afghan civilian population it has sought to inform, reassure, educate and through the promotion of free and unbiased discussion persuade Afghans that their futures are best served not with the Taliban, nor with ISAF but with themselves and their elected government.
The unit runs a network of radio stations employing local Afghan’s as DJs, broadcasting music, poetry, debate programmes and even a Helmandi soap opera, as well as producing graphical posters and leaflets to communicate in an area where literacy rates are only around 20%. Recent projects include information campaigns to prevent children picking up spent ordnance they find, disseminating information from farming and veterinary workshops using their radio stations, and promoting debate on political issues of the day.

Presenting the award, Chief of Defence Staff, Gen Sir David Richards said:

The work of 15POG has made a very significant contribution to fostering positive relations with local Afghan communities, and building vital understanding of our role and the role of the Afghan Government.

Speaking about the award, Commanding Officer of 15 (UK) Psychological Operations Group (15 POG) Commander Steve Tatham Royal Navy said:

We are delighted that our work is being recognised by this award. We are proud of our achievements helping foster better relations with the Afghans and building a sense of community and nationality, and of our support Task Force Helmand’s wider aims. The levels of literacy and technology in Helmand present challenges for us, but there is an appetite for information, education and debate that our work helps to satisfy. It is heartening to see how our work can directly improve people’s lives, whether helping them participate in elections, improve their farming and livelihood, or promoting basic healthcare.

The Firmin Sword of Peace was first instituted as the Wilkinson Sword of Peace in 1966 and is awarded each year to the unit of the UK’s armed services judged to have made the most valuable contribution towards establishing good and friendly relations with any community at home or overseas over and above the unit’s normal role and duty.

15 (UK) Psychological Operations Group - 15 (UK) Psychological Operations Group is a tri-service unit, responsible for Psychological Operations in support of the British Forces. The role of the Group is to influence attitudes in order to affect behaviour in support of a military commander’s mission.

Zharay district contains the Horn of Panjwaii, an insurgent stronghold from where attacks on Kandahar City have been enabled and supported, and Sangsar, the Taliban’s spiritual birthplace and former home of Mullah Omar.

Under this effort, known as Operation HAMKARI, or, as the soldiers call it, ‘The Battle of Kandahar’, the intent has been to defeat insurgent elements and increase Afghan Government influence across the area as well as enable development west of Kandahar City.

**See more pictures of the Royal Engineers in action during Operation HAMKARI in the Gallery at Related News.**The operation is considered to be of critical importance, to the extent that Commander ISAF, General David Petraeus, has described it as ‘the main effort of the world’, and he specifically discussed the UK capability and contribution when he met the Prime Minister last month.

One of the reasons 5 Armoured Engineer Squadron was brought on board by the US Army was to gain access to two Trojan armoured tanks which, with mine ploughs and the towed Python system, an explosives-laden hose launched via a rocket, can clear safe routes through high-threat IED areas.

5 Armoured Engineer Squadron was joined by other UK personnel from the Royal Logistic Corps (RLC), the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) and the Royal Army Medical Corps.

Other equipment capabilities used in support of the Trojan have included Husky support vehicles, REME’s Challenger armoured recovery and repair vehicles and the RLC’s enhanced platform logistic systems and fuel tankers.

The British unit has also had various US counter-IED, explosive ordnance disposal and other route construction teams under its command, integrating the assets to provide freedom of movement for the US and Afghan troops bringing about the operation’s main objectives.

The number of US personnel and the equipment that 5 Armoured Engineer Squadron has commanded is a clear reflection of the high regard in which British troops and commanders are held by the US Army.

In addition, the Brits have supported the operation by:

Major David Bickers, Officer Commanding 5 Armoured Engineer Squadron, said:

Even though an airborne battalion, the Americans we have worked alongside have grown to appreciate the benefits of armour, and armoured engineers in particular. The Trojan vehicles are the talk of the battalion; the US appreciate their ability to rapidly create new and safe routes and have designed their concepts of operations around the effects we can offer.

To a man, the US are hugely committed in what they are doing in Zharay and it has been an honour to fight alongside them. We have considered it a privilege to be involved in Operation HAMKARI. It is an ambitious and potentially decisive operation which strikes at the heart of Taliban support.

We have no doubt the US and their Afghan National Army partners will succeed in their operations here. Wherever we have been, Afghans have been relieved to have the Taliban pushed out from their villages. I think every man in 5 Squadron will look back on the last two months as one of the most formative experiences of their military careers.

Based out of Bastion, the largest coalition military base in the country, his squadron will provide surveillance, deterrence and, when required, close combat attack capabilities as well as escort duties for other aircraft.

Captain Wales qualified as a Co-Pilot Gunner (CPG) in February this year and was posted to 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, part of 16 Air Assault Brigade, to gain further flying experience and to operate the aircraft on a number of exercises.

He has been trained to fly in the front seat as the mission commander, a role that equips the operative to fly the aircraft from the back seat but the majority of the time involves operating the Apache’s sights, sensors and weapons systems.

The Deputy Commander of the JAG and Commanding Officer of 3 Regiment AAC in the UK, Lt Col Tom de la Rue, said:

Captain Wales is a serving soldier and a qualified Apache Pilot having completed the Apache Conversion to Role (CTR) course earlier this year. As such, and after further flying experience, he has deployed along with the rest of the squadron as part of a long-planned and scheduled deployment to provide support to ISAF and Afghan forces operating in Helmand.

It is a demanding job for my soldiers and all of them including Captain Wales are now focussing on the job in hand. I have every confidence that the team will deliver what is asked of them.

Commander of the JAG, Captain ‘Jock’ Gordon RN, said:

I extend an extremely warm welcome to 662 Squadron including Captain Wales who with his previous experience as a Forward Air Controller on operations will be a useful asset to the Joint Aviation Group. Working alongside his colleagues in the squadron, he will be in a difficult and demanding job and I ask that he be left to get on with his duties and allowed to focus on delivering support to coalition forces on the ground.

As with all operational deployments, Captain Wales’s deployment has been long planned and the threat to him and others around him thoroughly assessed. Any risk posed by Captain Wales’s deployment, based on capability, opportunity and intent of the insurgency, has been, and will continue to be, assessed and has informed the decision to deploy him.

The Apache AH MK1 fleet consists of 67 aircraft that have seen service in Afghanistan and in Libya. It is designed to hunt and destroy armoured vehicles and can operate in all weathers, day and night. It can detect, classify and prioritise up to 256 targets in seconds through its fire control radar and carries a mix of weapons, including rockets, Hellfire missiles and a 30mm chain gun.",Deployment of Captain Wales and the Apache AH MK1 fleet to support ISAF and Afghan forces in Helmand.,Other,Market-based,id25_217
218,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/army-and-navy-rowers-selected-for-olympic-team,News story,Army and Navy rowers selected for Olympic team,"Royal Naval Officer Lieutenant Pete Reed and Army officer Captain Heather Stanning have been officially selected to compete for Team GB at the 2012 Olympics, it has been announced today. Report by Lorraine McBride.",Ministry of Defence,6 June 2012,"The announcement that the two British military officers will be part of the Team GB rowing squad and compete in the Games comes with just 51 days to go until the start of the London 2012 Olympics.

The rowing events are tipped to provide Britain with its strongest chance of success at the Games.

Lieutenant Pete Reed

Lt Reed won an Olympic gold medal as part of the Men’s Four in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and will be defending his medal in the same event in London alongside Alex Gregory, Andrew Triggs Hodge and Tom James.

Between 2004 and 2008, 31-year-old Lt Reed became Olympic Champion and double World Champion in the coxless fours, and pulled off an unbeaten run of winning 27 international races.

Despite being among Britain’s brightest medal hopes this year, Lt Reed dismisses any suggestions that the team must be a gold medal certainty. He said:

We’ve got a lot of work to do and, if we start believing that, it’s very dangerous. There is massive talent in the coxless fours this year. Everyone is raising their game.

But, he added:

We’ll be doing everything we can to make the nation proud in August. It’s an opportunity to be part of history, to realise every sportsman’s dream, and to win gold in a home Olympics would be spectacular.

It’s going to be a massive challenge and we’re really ready. It’s just so exciting. There’s a good feeling in the team at the moment.

Lt Reed believes his officer training at Britannia Royal Naval College Dartmouth has been vital in shaping him into the sportsman he is today:

At Dartmouth I learnt about teamwork, determination and dedication, having enthusiasm for what I’m doing - and those things are exactly what I’m using every day to get the job done,” he said. “I don’t think I could have done this sport for as long as I have if I hadn’t gone through Dartmouth.

And the Armed Forces have backed Lt Reed’s rowing career ever since:

I can’t quite find the words at the moment to describe how supportive they’ve been,” he said. “I wouldn’t be rowing if it wasn’t for the Navy; I’d be doing the career that I signed up to do and got my teeth stuck into before I’d even started rowing, or before I’d even taken a stroke on the rowing machine.

To have them backing me is wonderful, and to have the Senior Service on your back when you’re training each day and to be as proud as I am to be wearing the White Ensign spurs me on. It’s something that will be with me as I cross the finishing line.

Captain Heather Stanning

Captain Heather Stanning, who will make her Olympic debut this year with partner Helen Glover in the women’s coxless pairs, said:

It’s amazing to be selected to represent my country at the Olympics. This is what I have been working for the last two years of my life.

Fresh from winning gold in the World Cup regattas in Belgrade and Lucerne, Royal Artillery officer Capt Stanning and crewmate Helen Glover hope to use their victories as a springboard for success in the Olympics:

It’s very exciting to be part of this,” said Capt Stanning. “But, at the same time, every day is a really important training day, and there is so much we can do between now and then.

I’m trying not to think too much about it because if I start getting nervous, then I’m going to be a nervous wreck,” she added.

Capt Stanning’s major breakthrough came with Helen Glover at the 2010 World Rowing Championships in New Zealand, when the pair doggedly hung on to the coattails of reigning world champions New Zealand to win silver.

Prior to that, Capt Stanning had won gold with Olivia Whitlam at the 2007 World Under-23 Championships, despite having only joined the GB rowing team’s start programme the previous year.

The daughter of Navy officers, Capt Stanning had hankered after a military career since her mid-teens, and won a sixth-form Army scholarship at Gordonstoun School. She was commissioned from Sandhurst in 2008.

In 2010, Capt Stanning was released from Army duties to allow her to row full-time:

The Army have been absolutely superb,” she said. “32 Regiment Royal Artillery carried on following me and I’ve popped down to see them when I can or they pop down to see me. They’ve been fantastic about making sure I’m okay, still enjoying it and looked after, and getting what I want from it.

The Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Peter Wall, said:

Heather Stanning’s selection for the British rowing team is brilliant news, and thoroughly deserved. All in the Army wish her the best of luck in the Olympic Games.

A former troop commander, Capt Stanning will return to Army duties in September.

First though, there is the small matter of the Olympics to get out of the way and, come the summer, Lt Pete Reed and Capt Heather Stanning may pull off sport’s Olympic dream and be the pride of Britain.",Support for Lt Reed and Capt Stanning’s rowing careers,Institutional,,id25_218

The centre can accommodate up to 27 personnel, including two families, and a further 30 day-residents. It also offers training facilities, classrooms, and gymnasiums with state-of-the-art sports equipment.

Residents will be able to learn new skills and gain qualifications in order for them to make a smooth transition into civilian life or return to duty.

As well as being there for current serving personnel, Chavasse VC House facilities and services are open to wounded, injured and sick veterans on a needs basis.

A support hub, offering a ‘one stop shop’ of advice and support for residents, veterans and their families, will provide access to the expertise of many welfare agencies, Service charities and organisations. This includes advice and guidance on a number of issues such as money, health, housing, social security and much more.

Help for Heroes, working closely with the MOD, has created Chavasse VC House with contributions from other Service charities, most notably the Royal British Legion, who have agreed to cover a very significant part of the operating costs.

Speaking on behalf of the MOD, Major General Gerry Berragan said:

We in the Armed Forces are extremely grateful for all the hard work involved, not only in successfully delivering this project, but also to the continued commitment shown by our partners and all the Service charities who are working to make the Defence Recovery Capability such a success.

As part of that capability, centres such as Chavasse VC House will make a tremendous difference to our wounded, injured and sick personnel and their families.

Help for Heroes is leading on the delivery, running, management and staffing of the centre, working in partnership with the Army, who have provided staff to command, care for and deliver key recovery activities to serving soldiers.

Gunner Maxine Ball, from 3rd Regiment Royal Horse Artillery, has a debilitating hip injury which has required surgery and treatment at Headley Court, as well as at the Personnel Recovery and Assessment Centres at Tedworth House and Catterick Garrison.

Gunner Ball’s first impression of the new centre was positive. She said:

It looks amazing and the staff are so friendly and welcoming.

Bryn Parry, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of Help for Heroes, said:

The opening of the Colchester Personnel Recovery Centre is an important milestone in the wider Defence Recovery Capability. Facilities such as this would not be possible if it were not for the great British public who continue to support our wounded heroes.

These men and women are young now but they will grow old and need the support now and for the rest of their lives, and Chavasse VC House will provide that support to those who need it in the local area.

John Crisford, National Vice Chairman of the Royal British Legion, said:

The range of support, both practical and emotional, that the Colchester PRC will provide to the wounded, injured and sick Service personnel who come here will make a vital contribution to their recovery, whether they return to duty or move into civilian life.

They have given so much for our country and deserve nothing less. The Royal British Legion will always support them and their families, and is very proud to be supporting this centre.

Chavasse VC House is the latest centre to be opened as part of the nationwide Defence Recovery Capability (DRC). The DRC is a MOD-led initiative in partnership with Help for Heroes and the Royal British Legion, alongside other Service charities and agencies.

It ensures that wounded, injured and sick personnel have access to the key services and resources needed to help them either return to duty or make an appropriately skilled transition into civilian life.",Chavasse VC House and the Defence Recovery Capability (DRC),Institutional,Welfare,id25_219

Commanding Officer Commander Paul Russell said:

The shooting down of live targets is the pinnacle of HMS Edinburgh’s regeneration. We now stand ready to deploy as a fully operational warship.

The firing comes shortly after the destroyer finished more than four months of basic operational sea training (BOST) in Plymouth.

That training saw the staff of Flag Officer Sea Training tested Edinburgh and her ship’s company in every environment and across the spectrum from minor fires and floods to high-intensity modern warfare and coping with extensive battle damage.

For this, air, sea, sub-surface and land forces from NATO and allied nations work together in task-groups, learning how to work together effectively for joint operations around the world.

As a Type 42 destroyer, HMS Edinburgh provides the backbone of the Royal Navy’s anti-air capability, and her role in the exercise was to protect the rest of the task force from air attack and her skills learnt at BOST were put to the test in a high-intensity air-defence environment.

Bomber Command veterans were joined at the foundation stone-laying ceremony by the Duke of Gloucester and Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Michael Beetham, himself a wartime Lancaster pilot and the President of the Bomber Command Association.

To mark the occasion a service was conducted by the Venerable (Air Vice-Marshal) Ray Pentland, Chaplain-in-Chief of the RAF, and included a reading by Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton.

The service ended with a spectacular flypast by the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Lancaster bomber aircraft.

During a reception following the ceremony, Sir Michael Beetham thanked the donors and others for their support:

All of you have played your part in one form or another as benefactors, fundraisers or organisers. I thank you,” he said.

President of the Heritage Foundation, Robin Gibb, who has been spearheading the Bomber Command Memorial Campaign for the last three years, said:

I am elated that we have come this far on what was rather a rocky road to begin with, especially for the veterans, the families of those who lost their lives.

This memorial will be a great example to young people, showing that democracy cannot be taken for granted. We have young men out in the world defending our freedom and we must show the world that we recognise them and respect them.

Entrepreneurs and philanthropists John Caudwell and Lord Ashcroft both have made major donations to the Memorial Fund.

Mr Caudwell said:

It is so vitally important to put this memorial up before it is too late for the remaining veterans to appreciate that this has been in the honour of their dead friends who served this country so well.

Minister for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans, Andrew Robathan, and Councillor Alan Bradley, Lord Mayor Locum Tenens, also attended the ceremony.

Other guests included Lord Craig representing the RAF Benevolent Fund, which will take over eventual ownership of the memorial.

Members of the public from the UK and overseas contributed to the appeal to create the memorial and have given both small and large donations to help make it a reality.

During the early evening, a Royal Air Force patrol of Tornado and Typhoon aircraft identified hostile vehicles near Waddan. A multiple rocket launcher and an armed pick-up truck were destroyed by the jets using Paveway laser and GPS guided bombs.

Another armed reconnaissance patrol during the evening, over Bani Walid, located a former regime main battle tank, which was subsequently disabled by a direct hit from a Brimstone missile.

On Saturday, 17 September, RAF Tornado GR4s were tasked by NATO to conduct a precision strike against a military headquarters near Hun in central Libya.

Professor Sir John Beddington, Government Chief Scientific Adviser, said:

The appointment of Vernon Gibson as Chief Scientific Adviser at the Ministry of Defence is excellent news for the Government and for the UK. As former Chief Scientist at BP his distinguished academic career alongside extensive industry experience will be invaluable to Ministry of Defence itself, as well as further strengthening the network of Chief Scientific Advisers across government.

Expert scientific advice is critical to good policy making and I am delighted to welcome someone with Vernon’s expertise to the fold. I look forward to working with him.

For further information contact Sonia Marshall in the MOD Press Office on 0207 218 5903.

Before joining BP in 2008, Professor Vernon Gibson held the Sir Edward Frankland Chair of Inorganic Chemistry at Imperial College London from 2001 to 2008 and was a personal Chair of Chemistry at the University of Durham from 1993 to 1995.

Professor Gibson trained at both Sheffield (BSc) and Oxford (DPhil) University and spent two years as a NATO post-doctoral fellow at the California Institute of Technology. He was elected to the Fellowship of the Royal Society in 2004 and was awarded an honorary DSc from the University of Sheffield in 2010.",Appointment of Professor Vernon Gibson as Chief Scientific Adviser,Institutional,Other,id25_223
224,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/royal-naval-medics-train-for-helmand,News story,Royal Naval medics train for Helmand,Royal Naval medical personnel have recently been undertaking training in North Devon for their upcoming deployment to Afghanistan.,Ministry of Defence,27 January 2011,"In contrast to the heat and terrain they will be coping with in Afghanistan, more than 200 medics endured freezing wind and rain at the Royal Marines Base Chivenor.

Members of the Close Support Medical Regiment, taken from Royal Naval and Army units countrywide, have been training for six months to provide battlefield medical support to the troops deploying on the ground in Afghanistan.

The training includes the use of amputee actors who simulate battlefield casualties for added realism, and the support of members of the Royal Marines Band Service who act as ambulance drivers and casualty handlers.

Most of those being trained are Royal Naval Able and Leading Medical Assistants who might be more used to working on ships or in hospitals, but are likely to end up working under fire in the same conditions during which Able Medical Assistant Kate Nesbitt, now of the Ministry of Defence Hospital Unit (MDHU) Derriford in Plymouth, earned her Military Cross.

Lieutenant Commander Mark Middleton, Officer Commanding A Squadron, said:

The medics are coming to the culmination of six months training in order to give support to the combat troops in Afghanistan.

They will be going out on patrol on the front line in the arduous and dangerous conditions where they may have to defend themselves and their patients from the Taliban.

Their training has included learning basic infantry as well as medical skills and it is now peaking with them putting it all together. They have been practising their existing trauma skills in a stressful environment where we make it as realistic as possible. The final test will lead the validation of their skills.

Ultimately their presence will give the combat troops the confidence to do their job properly, knowing they will be looked after by skilled medics. In turn, the troops will look after the medics and ensure they are safe.

The drills on the training included trauma care, paediatric life-support, and primary healthcare such as drawing up health plans for troops to maintain a healthy and fit fighting force.

One of those under training for her first deployment overseas is Able Medical Assistant Morwenna Nichols who is also based at MDHU Derriford. She was covered in mud from crawling along the ground encumbered by her rifle and trying to communicate with her colleagues and the ‘casualty’ over the roar of a Chinook helicopter carrying a Medical Emergency Response Team.

Despite these challenges, she was able to provide the appropriate medical support to the casualty. She said:

I am looking forward to going to Afghanistan because this is exactly what we have trained for as a Medical Assistant. There is only so much you can learn in a hospital so I am keen to go to use my full skills, but I know it will be tough.

The units involved include Royal Naval Air Station Yeovilton, Commando Training Centre, Lympstone, Portsmouth and Devonport Naval Bases, 42 and 29 Commando units in Plymouth and 45 Commando in Arbroath, and Queen Elizabeth Hospital and the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine at Selly Oak in Birmingham.",Training of medics for deployment to Afghanistan,Administrative,Other,id25_224

They are among 109 UK Service personnel and 40 civilians who, either for work in the Ministry of Defence or in other aspects of UK Defence, have been honoured in the List. The full list of Service personnel and Defence civilians can be seen at Related Links.

Dr Paul Rice

Dr Paul Rice has been recognised for his world-leading work in the fields of toxicology and chemical and biological agent defence.

Recently, Dr Rice has overseen the Ministry of Defence’s combat casualty care programme, which has developed numerous pioneering surgical techniques such as improved resuscitation procedures to counter the effects of blasts and haemorrhage on the battlefield.

This work has directly saved many lives on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and is also beginning to be used in civilian trauma care.

During a career that has spanned 25 years, Dr Rice has been called on to provide specialist medical advice during overseas military operations, and has supported the UK medical fraternity with his expertise in medical toxicology.

Dr Rice is also regarded extremely highly by senior US Defence officials as a leading authority in the area of toxicology and chemical and biological agent defence.

Dr Matt Chinn, Head of the Chemical and Biological Science and Technology Centre at Dstl, said:

Dr Paul Rice has made a truly outstanding contribution to the development of medical countermeasures against the wide variety of hazards that can be used against our deployed forces.

Dr Rice said:

I am clearly extremely honoured, but equally humbled to have received this recognition and reward.

Dr Carl Mayers

Dr Carl Mayers has been awarded the OBE in recognition of his work as a biologist at Dstl. He recently developed a pioneering screening capability and training programme which has had a significant impact for the UK military in Afghanistan.

Dr Mayers deployed to Afghanistan last year to establish the capability and to train operational military staff.

Dr Mayers has been at Dstl for 12 years, and during that time has contributed to a wide range of national and international research programmes, driving a cross-disciplinary approach to problem-solving that has resulted in some significant advances.

Mrs Penny Endersby, who headed up the Physical Sciences Department at Dstl, said:

I’m delighted that Carl’s exceptional efforts have been recognised with this well-deserved award. His ability to push the boundaries of the possible is recognised nationally and internationally, and I know of no-one else who could have delivered the results he and his team achieved in the time required.

Dr Mayers said:

It’s been a wonderful surprise to receive this honour. I consider myself very fortunate to work with such a talented and dedicated team of people, and I’m extremely proud of the impact our work has had.

A key role of the Royal Honorary Air Commodores is to raise the profile of their respective RAF stations, a task that recently saw the Duchess of Cornwall accept the Freedom of Entry to Thame as part of her official duties as the Honorary Air Commodore of RAF Halton.

The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton, was amongst the military top brass attending the function, which celebrated the close ties between the Royal Family and Royal Air Force personnel both past and present.

Group Captain Mark Heffron, Station Commander of RAF High Wycombe, worked alongside trustees and club management as the project officer for the event.

He said:

This is a unique occasion in the history of both the Royal Air Force and the Royal Air Force Club.

It has been our honour to host the Royal Honorary Air Commodores at this luncheon in the Diamond Jubilee year of Her Majesty’s patronage.

This is a day that will be cherished by the Royal Air Force Club for many, many years.

Whilst at the RAF Club, Her Majesty The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh signed royal portraits for the club. The portraits will be displayed in the Cowdray Room, named after Lord Cowdray, the founder of the RAF Club.

Air Vice-Marshal Matt Wiles, the RAF Club Chairman, said:

It was a huge privilege to welcome our patron, Her Majesty The Queen, back into the Royal Air Force Club during her Diamond Jubilee year.

The event also provided an excellent opportunity to recognise the outstanding contribution Her Majesty and other members of the Royal Family make as Honorary Air Commodores of our major Royal Air Force units, and the Club was delighted to host them and members of the Air Force Board.

The 40,000-tonne merchant ship, laden with valuable containers, contacted HMS Middleton to say she was 12 miles (19km) to the south west and had suffered an engine failure. That meant she was an easy target for the pirates who operate in the Gulf between Somalia and Yemen.

Monsoon rains in the Indian Ocean mean pirates favour the more sheltered Gulf between June and August, so Middleton and Pembroke sailed as quickly as possible to protect the drifting ship.

Having made contact with the vessel the two ships readied their weapons and maintained a patrol around her for several hours, protecting her crew and cargo against potential attack until she had fixed her engines and was able to continue north.

HMS Middleton’s Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Commander Steve Higham, said:

The threat from piracy in the Gulf of Aden is real and present. The MV New Delhi Express, disabled and without power, was a potential prime target for pirates.

Middleton and Pembroke responded immediately to provide assistance when called by her master, and were able to offer protection whilst he completed his repair.

Our small contribution to maintaining the safety of the maritime community shows the value and flexibility of the Royal Navy’s minehunting community.

Navies from dozens of countries work together throughout the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean to try and prevent cargo vessels being hijacked by pirates in small craft such as skiffs.

The RAF were also the victors in 2011.

Held by the Combined Services Cricket Association, proceeds from this year’s tournament are being donated to the Combat Stress charity.

First held in 2005 at the Army Cricket Ground in Aldershot, this is the third year that the tournament has been hosted at Lord’s.

The tournament sees each of the Armed Forces senior sides play two Twenty20 games during the single-day tournament. The three contests this year were played out in front of a lively crowd.

The first game of the tournament set the scene for an exciting day with the Royal Navy scoring 132 runs off their allotted 20 overs for the loss of four wickets.

In reply, the Army matched the Royal Navy’s score off the last ball, having also lost four wickets, producing a tied game that required the umpires and tournament officials to look back at the scorebook to see who had won.

After a few moments it was announced that the Royal Navy had won; the result being determined on which team had the better run-rate after 10 overs.

The second game saw the Army look to regroup against the RAF. Batting first, the Army lost early wickets and the RAF maintained the pressure throughout by attacking the batting with aggressive bowling and fielding. This resulted in a below par Army score of 44 all-out.

In reply, the RAF was made to struggle early on with aggressive Army bowling pinning the RAF batsmen back before they finally scored the runs required to win the game.

The final game saw the two unbeaten sides come together. Having won the toss, the Royal Navy batted first and the two openers made the most of the opportunity, with both scoring deserved half-centuries. The second half of the innings faltered slightly as wickets started to tumble, but a final score of 147 seemed certain to challenge the RAF.

In reply, the Royal Air Force batted steadily, maintaining the required run-rate before some explosive hitting from the middle order gained the advantage and ensured victory in the penultimate over.

The RAF’s team captain Flight Lieutenant Matt Compton held aloft the trophy on the pitch while Senior Aircraftman Graeme Cessford was named man of the tournament, for the second year running, for his dangerous fast-bowling and powerful batting.

Colonel Peter Sharland, Chairman of the Combined Services Cricket Association, said:

This has been a wonderful day of cricket with a keen competitive edge. We are very grateful to the Marylebone Cricket Club for their fantastic hospitality and unwavering support to the Armed Forces.

I am delighted for the players who have played at Lord’s today and will remember this event for the rest of their lives.

Combat Stress Chief Executive, Commodore Andrew Cameron, said:

We are delighted and very grateful to have been chosen to benefit from the Inter Services T20 Tournament.

“Combat Stress is currently treating and supporting almost 5,000 ex-servicemen and women suffering from trauma-related mental ill-health and we hope that your recognition through the 2012 Tournament will raise awareness of Combat Stress and encourage more people to seek our help, as well as raising much-needed funds for our vital work.”",Donation of proceeds to Combat Stress charity,Welfare,,id25_229

After a warm-up session organised by Physical Training Instructors, the ‘racers’ collected at the start ready for the off.

The nature of the event meant that all the participants had to wear something pink and running attire ranged from sports kit to full body armour - a group of Americans even wore T-shirts with bras over them.

Cheered on by a crowd of spectators, and encouraged throughout by the rousing music of the Band of the Corps of Royal Engineers, they set off for 12 laps of the race route.

For the next hour, participants ran, walked and, in one case, ran as a three-legged pair, around the course to raise over £1,300 for cancer research.

The event was organised by Senior Aircraftwoman Lauren Bird, who has taken part in the Race for Life for the last seven years and was keen not to miss out just because she was on duty in Afghanistan.

Although Race for Life is a women-only event in the UK, SAC Bird found that many of her male colleagues wanted to show their support to their mums, sisters, wives and girlfriends taking part in the official runs around Britain, and decided that including men in this event was an excellent way for them to do so.

SAC Bird, who has lost several people to whom she was close to cancer, including her godmother, who lost her fight against cancer the day that SAC Bird travelled from the UK to Afghanistan, felt that this was a great way for Service personnel to help fund cancer research:

This is a cause that is dear to my heart and it was fantastic to see so many people turn up in their pink T-shirts to show their support,” she said. “To raise this much was amazing and was much more than I expected when I came up with the idea.

Group Captain Andy Linstead, Officer Commanding 904 Expeditionary Air Wing, also took part in the run. He said:

At around the same time, other RAF aircraft conducted a surgical strike on the military Identification Friend or Foe antenna at Tripoli Airport, the use of Brimstone missiles allowing the effect of the attack to be confined to just the military installation.

At sea, the frigate HMS Iron Duke used her 4.5-inch (114mm) gun to fire a barrage of illumination rounds off Zlitan, to the west of Misurata. The star shells helped NATO aircraft to accurately target regime positions in the area, including two rocket-firing sites.

Further military action took place on Tuesday and Wednesday. Major General Nick Pope, the Chief of the Defence Staff’s Communications Officer, said:

On Tuesday morning, an RAF patrol over Zlitan identified a regime mortar position and destroyed it with a Brimstone missile.

The pressure was maintained on Gaddafi’s troops in the area during the night when HMS Ocean launched her Apache attack helicopters against regime forces repressing the population in and around Al Khums; Fleet Air Arm Sea Kings provided airborne radar cover.

The targets were a vehicle checkpoint and a group of buildings which previous NATO surveillance missions had established as being used by regime forces. Hellfire missiles were successfully used to destroy the group of six buildings, as well as a large building at the checkpoint.

Iron Duke once again fired illumination rounds to assist NATO surveillance missions around Zlitan during the night.

Major General Pope continued:

Whilst allied aircraft continued to patrol the length and breadth of Libya, NATO taskings kept the UK’s operational contribution focused on Zlitan throughout Wednesday.

RAF jets attacked some 29 buildings in and around the town which had been variously confirmed by detailed reconnaissance and analysis as command and control centres and military supply, ammunition and fuel storage facilities used by Colonel Gaddafi’s troops in repressing the local people.

Our aircraft also struck five multiple rocket launcher systems and a pair of heavy infantry weapon positions in the area. HMS Iron Duke took action against artillery positions which she observed firing towards Misurata; a number of high explosive rounds from her 4.5-inch [114mm] gun quickly silenced the regime guns.

After dark, Ocean once again launched her Apaches, which used Hellfire missiles to destroy two large military vehicle sheds near Al Khums.

All must have completed at least 22 years’ service and reached the rank of warrant officer.

Until 2009, sailors were exempt from the role. Unlike soldiers, airmen and marines, they swear no oath of allegiance to the monarch. But the Governor of the Tower petitioned The Queen to change the rules, and Her Majesty assented.

Now Royal Navy senior ratings can also qualify as Yeoman Warders.

WO1 Fuller, whose 34-year career in the Royal Navy saw him serve on assault ships Fearless and Intrepid and as Executive Warrant Officer - the most senior rating - aboard former flagship HMS Ark Royal, has become only the second sailor to don the famous black and red uniform.

After five months’ training - including learning ‘the story of the Tower’ (which is akin to London cabbies learning ‘the Knowledge’) - WO1 Fuller had to take the Constable of the Tower on a tour to prove he knew all anyone would need to know about the historic riverside fortification.

Test passed, the 52-year-old was ready to guide the first of the daily 10,000 visitors through the gates of the Tower, with the help of the three dozen other Beefeaters - only the second sailor to do so in the 502-year history of the Yeoman Warders.

WO1 Fuller’s title means he now lives in the Tower grounds:

It is surreal to see Tower Bridge out of the living room window,” he said. “My kids think it’s cool and like dad’s job and his London pad a lot.

He added that he feels ‘very proud and privileged’ to join the long, illustrious line of Beefeaters - and blaze a trail for fellow matelots.

In years past the Beefeaters served as guards for the gates and prisoners in the Tower (including the Kray twins for avoiding National Service in the early 1950s), but today the role is a mix of ceremonial and tour guide (although the warders are also Extraordinary Members of the Queen’s Bodyguard).",Changes to the eligibility criteria for Yeoman Warders,Institutional,Administrative,id25_232

While varied intelligence-gathering is nothing new to Helmand province, evolving technological capabilities on both sides of the fight mean that ‘electronic warfare’ is becoming an increasingly significant term.

By listening in on insurgents, the International Security Assistance Force gathers information on when, why and how the Taliban plans to make its moves.

Corporal Darren Fowler, who works as a communications systems operator with 223 Signal Squadron, part of 14 Signal Regiment, said:

Our role is to collect intelligence within theatre. With our state-of-the-art equipment we can monitor messages to find insurgents’ tactical procedures.

Corporal Fowler will form part of the Op HERRICK 16 contingent running new specialist ‘manpacks’ which enable operators to tap into communications in real time.

Details of this technology are classified but such vital work has seen 14 Signal Regiment represented on each UK mission since the Falklands War.

Out on the battlefield, unit members are split into light electronic warfare teams of up to four members. Systems operator Corporal Morgan Scott said:

The groups are out and about in the area of operations, directed by the brigade commander in accordance with his or her priorities. We can collect intelligence that helps us understand what is happening in a certain location.

A signaller co-ordinating communications [Picture: Graeme Main, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]

Corporal Fowler added:

When we first go in, infantry guys are not too sure about having us with them, but after giving threat warnings and providing the good news, they begin to love us. We basically become part of the infantry - we live in the base and are members of the team.

Each cluster of the specialists includes a systems operator, an Intelligence Corps analyst and a communications expert. All members can work in each other’s role and, thanks to evolving technology, their analyses are proving more precise than ever before:

Equipment is increasingly computer-based with new software that has made us more accurate and useful for the commanders on the ground,” Corporal Fowler said.

If we can get the grid quickly it means insurgents have much less of a chance to move on.

While training on Exercise Dragon’s Talon, Lance Corporal Tom Scales, 237 Signal Squadron (Electronic Warfare), outlined the kind of information his unit can obtain:

We find out as much about the enemy as possible - where they work, who they work for and where the areas of resupply are,” the serviceman explained.

By tapping into the insurgents’ communications network and using linguistics experts from the Intelligence Corps, light electronic warfare teams can work out why villagers might be supporting the Taliban.

Using equipment acquired as an urgent operational requirement, the signallers are braced to inform their infantry counterparts of potential attacks. At a time when the Army is reducing in size, 14 Signal Regiment is one of the few units set to expand in the wake of the Strategic Defence and Security Review.

Between now and 2013 it will grow by eight per cent to around 750 personnel. Major Paul Buck, Second-in-Command of 14 Signal Regiment, said:

In this tough climate, if you are a bright bloke with a bit about you then this is the place to succeed. Those with an inquiring mind and keen for a challenge are the sort of people we are looking for.

Following the incident involving two of our Tornado GR4 aircraft in the Moray Firth yesterday, it is with great sadness that I must confirm the death of one of the crew members, an officer from 15 (Reserve) Squadron, based here at RAF Lossiemouth.

A second crew member remains under medical care, where he is in a serious but stable condition.

Two additional personnel remain unaccounted for. Due to extremely poor weather conditions in the area, the RAF and Her Majesty’s Coastguard have made a joint decision not to resume search and rescue operations.

The operation will be resumed as a recovery operation as soon as possible, but we must be realistic: given the length of time that has elapsed since the accident, there is no expectation of recovering missing personnel alive.

They are the last British unit to serve in the area, having handed over authority to US forces in the last few weeks. See Related News for more on this.

The first of the Marines to return home were from the 114-strong Charlie Company. They arrived at their home base of Norton Manor Camp, near Taunton in Somerset, yesterday, Wednesday 6 October 2010, where they were greeted by more than 300 friends and family members.

The homecoming was described as a ‘bittersweet’ moment by officers who recognised that the joy of returning to friends and family was tempered by the loss the unit had experienced over the tour.

Major Duncan Forbes, Officer Commanding Charlie Company, said:

It’s a bittersweet day being back here; 21 people from the battle group were killed and 14 of them were Royal Marines.

Their sacrifice was not made in vain; they did an amazing job every day, showing bravery and leadership, which is humbling for us as their leaders to look to.

It’s a sad day for those families who have not got their husbands coming back.

During their deployment 40 Commando worked in partnership with the Afghan National Security Forces to disrupt insurgent operations.

Speaking last month as the Marines started handing over authority for Sangin to US forces, Lieutenant Colonel Paul James, Commanding Officer of 40 Commando Royal Marines, said:

It’s been a hard fight for 40 Commando Royal Marines in Sangin, but we have achieved much. We have sought to protect the local people and have worked hard to support the Afghan National Security Forces.

Our partners in the ANA [Afghan National Army] and ANP [Afghan National Police] have improved tremendously. They have provided the security for the District Governor to spread the influence of the Afghan Government.

The bazaar itself, central to the economy of the area, is thriving and a much more bustling place than when we arrived with new shops opening all the time.

There is still work to do, and we are confident that our American partners will build on what we have achieved. We have lost brave Marines, but we will do them proud and return home with our heads held high.

British forces have been in Sangin, a key economic and transport hub, since 2006. Alongside the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), they have provided vital security for the local population on behalf of the Government of Afghanistan, enabling development and preventing the insurgency from using Sangin as a base from which to mount attacks across Helmand.

The handover of authority for Sangin to US forces allows UK forces to focus their efforts in central Helmand where they will continue to deliver effective counter-insurgency operations, working alongside the ANSF.",Deployment of British forces to Sangin under Operation HERRICK 12,Institutional,Other,id25_235

The new headquarters - delivered by Defence Estates and specially designed and built for a deployable regiment - is called ‘Home Lines’ (pronounced ‘Hume’) after the tartan worn by the regiment.

The term ‘Lines’ refers to a system of linear defensive fortifications and goes back at least as far as the time of the Napoleonic Peninsula War in the early 1800s.

During the opening celebrations of the new facilities in Lisburn, County Antrim, the regiment was also able to honour a number of colleagues who earned operational honours during the arduous deployment.

Three Chief of Joint Operations Commendations, two Commander British Forces (Afghanistan) Commendations for outstanding contributions during Operation HERRICK 10, and one Long Service and Good Conduct Medal were presented to 40th Regiment personnel.

The ceremonies ended with a unique gun run competition. Two teams of six or seven military personnel emerged from vehicles and assembled L118 105mm Light Guns for action before completing an assault course and returning to fire the guns.

The L118 105mm Light Gun has been used in every British conflict since the Falklands and is still in use in Afghanistan today. It is mobile, durable, dependable, suitable for any weather conditions, and is widely regarded as a classic piece of artillery.",Creation or restructuring of agencies or bodies,Institutional,,id25_236

She will be berthed at Greenwich until after the Paralympics, and will act as a helicopter landing platform and logistics hub in support of maritime and air security operations.

HMS Ocean will also accommodate 400 military personnel who will be part of the venue security force for nearby Greenwich Park.

When Ocean last visited London, in May, to prepare for her Olympics tasking, thousands of people from local communities got the chance to take a short tour of the ship while she was berthed at Greenwich.

And Captain Andrew Betton, HMS Ocean’s Commanding Officer, is again pleased to be able to offer another opportunity for the public to venture aboard when the massive warship opens her gangways this weekend.

The ship will be open to visitors on Sunday, 15 July, from 1000hrs to 1500hrs, with free boat transfers from Greenwich Pier (London SE10 9HT). Access to the boat transfer area is via the grounds of the Old Royal Naval College, where there will also be a bag search point.

There will be no left luggage (including buggies) facility offered. Please note that access to the ship requires ascending ladders and is therefore not suitable for individuals with mobility difficulties - please also dress suitably.

Captain Betton said:

I know the ship’s company are very much looking forward to returning to London after a warm welcome in May. As we are expecting a large turnout of people on Sunday, you would be best advised to get there early and expect to queue - while we will do our best to get you on board, we can offer no guarantees.

An amphibious assault ship, HMS Ocean is designed to deliver Royal Marines commandos to the centre of the action by helicopter or by landing craft - there are six helicopter operating spots on the flight deck, and the hangar can hold many more aircraft. The ship also has an assault squadron embarked, 9 Assault Squadron Royal Marines, and carries four landing craft capable of landing troops or a Land Rover-sized vehicle ashore.

HMS Ocean played a key role in support of the UN Security Council Resolution off Libya last year, acting as the base for the Army’s Apache attack helicopters and the Royal Navy’s Sea King surveillance helicopters.

The Apache helicopters flying from HMS Ocean complemented the RAF jets, delivering additional precision strike capability with considerable success. Over the course of the operation, the Apache crews from 656 Squadron Army Air Corps attacked Libyan military vehicles, installations and communications equipment.

The majority of the soldiers on parade were from 39 Engineer Regiment, which is based at Waterbeach Barracks, and 33 Engineer Regiment (EOD), which is based a short distance away in Wimbish.

During Operation HERRICK 15, between October 2011 and April 2012, the Task Force was at the forefront of the fight against deadly improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Helmand province, southern Afghanistan.

Working in teams, the Task Force provides three main capabilities - high risk search, IED disposal and conventional munitions disposal - and is responsible for finding and disposing of all IEDs and explosive ordnance within Helmand.

Across the province, IEDs continue to pose the most prevalent and indiscriminate threat to life and limb and countering this demands the highest standards of professionalism, dedication and skill.

Commanding Officer Lieutenant Colonel Jason Rhodes said:

Actively searching for and then walking towards an IED was a team effort and I was humbled by the daily acts of bravery shown by each and every individual; the searches, dog handlers … and the EOD teams.

During their tour the Task Force continued to train and develop the Afghan bomb disposal operators. Six teams are now operating independently of ISAF assistance across central Helmand, and in support of fellow Afghan soldiers and police officers.

The scheme – part of the government’s Plan for Jobs that will spur the country’s economic recovery from coronavirus – applies to all food and non-alcoholic drinks, with a maximum discount per person of £10. It could save a family of four up to £40 per meal.

More than 72,000 establishments are participating, including independent eateries and family favourites such as Pizza Express, Costa Coffee and Nando’s.

There have already been over 3.3 million hits on the Eat Out to Help Outrestaurant findersince it launched last week, which shows what businesses are participating in local areas, and many restaurants have since seen a boost in bookings. Apps like Opentable, Fork and Bookatable are all planning pages to support the scheme.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said:

Our Eat Out to Help Out scheme’s number one aim is to help protect the jobs of 1.8 million chefs, waiters and restaurateurs by boosting demand and getting customers through the door.

More than 72,000 establishments will be serving discounted meals across the country, with the government paying half the bill. The industry is a vital ingredient to our economy and it’s been hit hard by coronavirus, so enjoy summer safely by showing your favourite places your support – we’ll pay half.

The scheme will help protect the jobs of the hospitality industry’s 1.8 million employees by encouraging people to safely return to their local restaurants, cafes and pubs where social-distancing rules allow.

Around 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April, with 1.4 million workers furloughed, the highest of any sector.

Many participating restaurants offer healthy and low-calorie options, and the scheme should be enjoyed as part of a healthy and balanced lifestyle. No vouchers are needed, with the participating establishment deducting 50% from the bill.

People may be worried about returning to eat out. To address these concerns, businesses have prepared to become Covid-secure through, for example, protective screens, contactless payments, social distancing, one way walking systems, online bookings and reduced capacity.

The Eat Out to Help Out scheme is one part of the Chancellor’s £30 billion Plan for Jobs, announced last month. Other measures announced to protect, support and create jobs include cutting VAT for tourism and hospitality by 15%, a £2 billion Kickstart Scheme and an £8.8 billion investment in new infrastructure, decarbonisation and maintenance projects.

Internationally, it is regarded as one of the toughest tests the modern-day soldier can face and some foreign entrants have to claim the right to take part by winning through their own domestic challenge.

This year’s Exercise Cambrian Patrol saw teams from Estonia, Switzerland and Finland take part for the first time, joining troops from other countries such as Pakistan, India, the United States and Regular and Territorial Army soldiers from the British Army.

In total, 15 international teams made up the total of 90 taking part.

Team patrol commanders are then given orders for onward briefing to members of their patrol. Patrols are then taken to a number of drop-off points in the hills.

Speaking at a location eight miles (13km) north east of Llandrindod Wells, at the tip of Radnor Forest, mid-Wales, just prior to setting off on the patrol, Trent said his team had to win through a domestic competition for the right to take part Cambrian:

The competition back home is called the Duke of Gloucester Cup and involves the infantry battalions from the Australian Army,” said for former outdoor education instructor.

It’s a test of endurance and military skills - a sort of mini Cambrian. Taking part in this exercise in Wales is prestigious because we had to win that right to participate. It will be a huge achievement for us to take back a medal because we know how tough the next 48 hours will be.

Pte Trent continued:

We’ve spent a week in the UK and have been hosted by the Coldstream Guards. Some of the soldiers in that unit have experience of Cambrian and they’ve told us what to expect.

One of the toughest things may probably be the weather because we’re used to the more tropical, warmer side of things. But this is a challenge we’re going to take seriously and we want to do well. That’s why I joined the Army, to take on challenges.

Split into seven phases, the teams then have to march a mind-and-muscle sapping 55km carrying full personal kit and equipment, weighing in at some 60lbs (27kg), on a two-day patrolling mission.

Navigating both by day and night, the patrols face many testing and specialist challenges, including observation and reconnaissance of enemy forces, cold river crossings in full kit without access to boats, first-aid and defensive shooting under attack.

At the completion of their patrol, each team faces a comprehensive debriefing session on their mission.

Military skills, stamina and dedication are constantly evaluated during the patrol and marked with a system of points. Teams that successfully complete their patrol are awarded a gold, silver or bronze medal or certificate of merit, depending on the total number of points they have gained.

Warrant Officer Class 1 Brian Pratt, who organises the event on behalf of 160 (Wales) Brigade, said:

This is the world cup of patrolling. For more than 50 years the reputation of Cambrian Patrol has grown ever stronger and that is reflected in the consistent number of teams we get applying to take part.

It will link the community more closely to the provincial government in Lashkar Gah and national government in Kabul.

The council’s functions will include how to spend central government money on essential services such as schools and health clinics.

Speaking about progress in this area, Michael O’Neill, Head of the British-led Helmand Provincial Reconstruction Team, which has been helping the Afghans establish DCCs in Helmand, said:

These elections are a powerful indicator of the progress achieved in Marjah over the past year. District Community Councils are an important part of representative governance to give local communities a voice and extend Afghan delivery of public services.

The Marjah DCC is the sixth to be established in Helmand, from Garmsir in the south to Musa Qal’ah in the north. These bodies reflect Helmand’s strong tradition of participatory decision-making, and will contribute to an environment in which vibrant and peaceful local politics can flourish.

The elections followed a ‘shura’, or meeting of elders, last month that was attended by over 1,300 district residents who came to hear Provincial Governor Gulab Mangal set out plans for the poll.

243,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-armour-steel-showcased-at-dsei,News story,New armour steel showcased at DSEi,A new high-performance armour steel that will be used to protect vehicles on the front line was showcased at the Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEi) event today.,Ministry of Defence,14 September 2011,"Known as Super Bainite, the new armour steel has been developed to have outstanding ballistics properties and, in tests, it has performed better than ‘normal’ steel armour.

The Ministry of Defence has signed a licensing agreement with Tata Steel to manufacture the steel in the UK.

The new material was invented and developed in the UK, with production earmarked to take place at Port Talbot in South Wales.

Under the agreement the steel will be turned into seven different items, including perforated armour plates that could be used on future front line armoured vehicles.

Visiting the UK Capability Showcase at DSEi, Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology, Peter Luff, said:

This cutting-edge UK invention and the manufacturing agreement mean that the UK now has its own onshore supply of high-performance armour steel. Super Bainite has both military and civilian applications, providing Tata Steel with important export opportunities.

The application of new, battle-winning technologies is what gives our troops the edge. This demonstrates, once again, that investing in research and development, in partnership with industry, means that our troops can have the latest innovations in front line equipment.

Super Bainite was invented by Professor Peter Brown, Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), Professor Harry Bhadeshia, Tata Steel Professor of Metallurgy at Cambridge University, and Dr Carlos Garcia-Mateo, previously at Cambridge University and currently at the National Centre for Metallurgical Research in Madrid.

Traditionally, steel is covered with water to get it to room temperature quickly before structural weaknesses can form. But, with Super Bainite, a whole variety of cooling methods, involving air or even molten salt, are used throughout production.

Combining drilling and hole-punching during the cooling process results in a ultra-high-hardness perforated plate.

Professor Brown said:

The ballistic performance of perforated Super Bainite steel armour is at least twice that of conventional rolled homogenous steel armour. This is because the introduction of perforations creates a large number of edges which disrupt the path of incoming projectiles, significantly reducing their potency.

Dstl owns the patents relating to the chemical composition and processing of Super Bainite. The licence agreement was signed by Ploughshare Innovations and Tata Steel and allows Tata Steel to manufacture and process Super Bainite in the UK and in Europe and to export it globally.

Dr Paul Davies of Tata Steel hopes defence equipment manufacturers, especially armour systems specialists, will recognise the steel’s potential for applique up-armouring applications. He said:

Tata Steel has spent significant effort developing this unique product and we are delighted with its performance. We have outlined our market strategy.

Tata Steel is well positioned to support the market, both in the UK and across the remainder of European markets, by exercising existing infrastructure to produce and process the material for future customers.",Licensing agreement with Tata Steel,Legislative,Administrative,id25_243

Here follows an operational update.",Ministry of Defence,6 January 2012,"In the last two weeks of December the VC10s of 101 Squadron successfully completed all of their planned missions, delivering 130 tonnes of fuel to coalition aircraft. The majority of this fuel was delivered to the Tornado GR4s of 12 (Bomber) Squadron, with the remainder going to French and Italian aircraft.

The last few days of 2011 were an intense period in which fuel was primarily delivered to F-18s of the US Navy. This was critical to ensuring that coalition air power delivered armed overwatch and ‘shows of force’ or close air support to troops on the ground across Afghanistan.

The 39 Squadron Reaper detachment, operating from Kandahar Airfield, continued to provide the detailed imagery and intelligence crucial to ground commanders and delivered over 300 hours of full motion video (FMV) during the period.

This rounds off what has been a particularly busy year for the Reaper Remotely Piloted Air System, which has flown more than 1,200 missions in the skies over Afghanistan. Not only has Reaper delivered key successes against insurgents through kinetic strikes it has also delivered over 11,000 hours of FMV in total which has been critical to the continued success on the ground as we move towards transition.

The Sentinel R1 aircraft of 5 (Army Cooperation) Squadron continued to support operations in Afghanistan, primarily across Regional Command (South West). The majority of the activity was to provide pattern of life data in support of a number of disparate operations led by the US Marines of Task Force Leatherneck and UK ground forces operating as part of Task Force Helmand.

The Sentinel’s Ground Moving Target Indicator function continues to be highly sought after, with no let up in the Christmas and New Year period resulting in over 90 hours being flown.

The Royal Navy’s Sea King Airborne Surveillance and Control (SKASaC) helicopters, operating as part of 903 Expeditionary Air Wing (EAW) at Camp Bastion, had a very successful final two weeks of 2011, flying more than 60 operational hours.

One of the key successes resulted in the detention of an insurgent along with a sizeable quantity of heroin. The continued development of tactics and procedures has seen the SKASaCs integrate into any force package and become a key element within a layered Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance ethos.

The Tornado GR4s of 12 (Bomber) Squadron, operating from 904 EAW at Kandahar, were exceptionally busy in the run up to Christmas and the New Year.

The outstanding all-weather capabilities of the GR4 were particularly important, with 12 Squadron covering extended periods of Ground Alert Close Air Support. During this time they were launched on four occasions to provide armed support to troops on the ground which had been engaged by insurgents and armed overwatch to a number of other ground-based activities.

Additionally, the crew of a GR4 displayed great tactical patience to engage a vehicle carrying homemade explosives. Their exceptional airmanship in difficult conditions ensured a successful kinetic strike was carried out.

In the final week of 2011 the GR4s carried out three ‘shows of force’ in support of coalition ground forces. The first was in support of US troops who had observed two insurgents on motorbikes preparing for an attack in Paktika province. The second was again in support of US troops west of Kandahar, where it was used to disrupt potential insurgent activity. The final show of force was requested by Italian troops to support a convoy. All of these shows of force successfully deterred or disrupted enemy action.

Additionally, the squadron undertook seven reconnaissance missions, collecting data on more than 1,600 points of interest which proved essential in the support of ground commanders.",Delivery of fuel and intelligence support to coalition forces in Afghanistan.,Welfare,"Other (strategic plans, consultations)",id25_244

In a dominant performance, the world championship silver medallists raced into an early lead in the 2,000-metre race at Eton Dorney Lake and clocked a time of 7 minutes 27.13 seconds, beating the reigning world champions New Zealand and the twice defending champion Romanian pair by a comfortable margin.

After crossing the line, the pair embraced and waved to the sell-out crowd of 30,000 spectators including Princes William and Harry who had been cheering the pair to victory. The crowd were buoyant at seeing Britain’s first Olympic gold medal champions crowned at a home Games.

Speaking after the race on BBC1, an overjoyed Heather Stanning, a captain in the Royal Artillery, said:

I’m absolutely shattered and want to collapse but I also want to jump up and down. I’m excited and absolutely ecstatic all at the same time. I’m just so overjoyed.

During their post-match interview, the BBC played a message from Afghanistan where troops cheered the women’s victory, delighted that one of their army family had claimed one of sport’s ultimate triumphs. Captain Stanning thanked them for their support and said that she looked forward to seeing friends and colleagues when they returned home.

At the medal ceremony, the pair fought back tears as they stepped up on the podium to claim the first ever Olympic gold for Britain in women’s rowing.

The Olympic rowing final took place at Eton Dorney Lake, near Windsor, where Olympic debutante Captain Stanning and crewmate Helen had smashed the Olympic record in their qualifying heat just a day after the opening ceremony.

The daughter of Navy officers, Captain Stanning believes the military lifestyle was hardwired into her as a child, making it, along with the attraction of adventure training and opportunity for sport, a natural career choice. She was commissioned from Sandhurst in 2008 before joining 32 Regiment Royal Artillery.

Then, two years ago, she was released from Army duties so she could attempt to row her way into Olympic history. Speaking to Defence Focus in June, Captain Stanning said:

The Army have been absolutely fantastic at supporting me and giving me time off while it has clearly been a busy time.

Captain Stanning credits her Army training with helping her keep a clear head and to stick to her goals:

What I learned in Sandhurst was that you’re given your mission and you stick to it,” she said.

Captain Stanning reflected on the prospect of Olympic glory and what it would mean to the Army:

Hopefully,” she said, “seeing an officer achieve something on the world stage will inspire other soldiers. And part of our performance will be a way of saying thank you to 32 Regiment Royal Artillery.

It involved the search of a compound in Sangin which uncovered 13 rifles, four rocket-propelled grenade launchers (RPGs), an 82mm mortar and a large quantity of ammunition including RPG, mortar and artillery rounds, anti-personnel mines and small arms ammunition.

The second operation, just 48 hours later in the Pupalzay region of Lashkar Gah district, uncovered over 90kg of opium. This operation was supported by the PRC Embedded Mentoring Team and soldiers from the Queen’s Royal Hussars, who provided security in the area to allow the operation to proceed.

The PRC is currently mentored by members of the RAF Regiment who are part of the Police Mentoring and Advisory Group (PMAG). The PRC Embedded Mentoring Team have put the PRC through their basic and advanced training and have deployed on the ground with them in a mentoring role over the past five months.

Flight Lieutenant Tom Foskett is Officer Commanding the PRC mentoring team. He said:

This has been an extremely successful 48 hours in which the PRC proved that their months of training have worked. They are fully capable of deploying unmentored at short notice and have clearly demonstrated their capability to carry out high-profile operations across the province.

The second operation was a complementary operation with the Queen’s Royal Hussars [QRH] which enabled the PRC to penetrate an insurgent stronghold and strike at the heart of their supply chain.

Although the QRH deployed alongside the PRC for the operation they were only there to provide additional support if really needed. In fact, the PRC inserted into the area and extracted with only their mentoring team in direct support.

Captain Tyrell Volker is the Intelligence Officer for the PMAG and works closely with the Afghan Police in developing their intelligence capability. He said:

This operation demonstrates the step-change in institutional development within the Afghan Police. Particularly in developing a sustainable intelligence forum in which the police, army and other agencies can fuse their efforts, resulting in successful intelligence-based operations, such as this one.

The PMAG, led by 1st Battalion The Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment (1 PWRR), is responsible for mentoring the Afghan National Police at provincial and district level and aiding institutional development.

His rescue tally has been amassed in just 13 years of Search and Rescue flying - at both Culdrose in Cornwall and in Scotland.

His 800 call-out tally, which resulted in him rescuing 624 people, led to his exceptional service being drawn to the attention of Scottish daily newspaper the Daily Record, which has nominated him as a finalist in the Our Armed Forces category of its prestigious annual Our Heroes awards.

The gala awards ceremony will be held at the Hilton Hotel in Glasgow on 13 May 2011:

To me it’s just my job and it’s a job which I love, so to be nominated for an award like this is very humbling really,” explained PO Wigfull. “Each and every call is different in its own way - even the calls which we would call routine.

And, as a result, every day on duty is different. You never know what’s round the corner, but you can be sure that, if we’re called out, it’s because someone else is having a bad day.

It’s a great feeling to know that whether it is a mountain climber who has fallen and injured themselves, a pregnant mum with delivery complications or a stranded yachtsman in heavy seas, that what the duty crew and I do can make a real difference.

There are four people in a SAR duty crew and we all play our part each and every time - it’s true teamwork.

PO Wigfull has been described as ‘a credit’ to the Fleet Air Arm and the Royal Navy by HMS Gannet’s Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Commander Debdash Bhattacharya, who said:

Wiggy shows great enthusiasm and dedication to his job and it is a pleasure to work with him. He has played a large part in the successes enjoyed by HMS Gannet over the years.

I have no doubt that, while it goes without saying that we in the Royal Navy greatly value him and his experience, it’s likely that each and every one of the 600+ people he has rescued would have been impressed by his skill and professionalism.

In addition to the demands of his day job, Wiggy always makes time to get involved with various charitable activities and he is a keen supporter of community outreach projects from conducting schools visits to raising funds for charities.

He is an excellent ambassador for the SAR community and Royal Navy.

One of PO Wigfull’s most difficult rescues in recent years was that of three crew from a yacht in heavy seas off Ayrshire.

The yacht was caught on rocks and pitching violently in the waves. Lowering PO Wigfull down from the helicopter was not only tricky but dangerous, too, as the yacht’s mast and rigging could easily have become caught on the winch wire.

Not only did he get the three people off safely, he did it very rapidly in spite of the conditions and an injury to his hand which he sustained while trying to board the yacht.

He was awarded the Queen’s Commendation for Bravery in the Air for his actions.

Other memorable or difficult rescues in recent times have included:

• rescuing four people from three separate lightning strikes on the same day in the Lake District and also, on a different occasion, a woman who fell 300ft (91.5m) on Striding Edge.

• safe recovery of a surfer off Machrihanish Beach on the Mull of Kintyre in 60mph (97km/h) winds and 15ft (5m) seas with only 20 minutes’ light remaining - his board was found a few days later three miles (5km) away.

We were also called out to rescue a young lad, six years old, who fell 30 feet (9m), again in the Lake District,” PO Wigfull said. “To make this one worse, his mum fell over the same ledge trying to rescue him.

I found that one difficult as my son was the same age and the mum was not bothered how injured she was, she just wanted to make sure her lad was OK. The good news was that both recovered well.

And, on 20 April this year, PO Wigfull was part of the four-man duty crew from HMS Gannet which airlifted a total of seven people and a dog to safety from the island of Staffa off Scotland’s west coast after their boat capsized leaving them stranded on a narrow rock ledge at the foot of 130ft (40m) cliffs with a rising tide in front of them.

PO Wigfull is currently an aircrewman, paramedic and instructor at HMS Gannet, which covers a huge area - from Ben Nevis in the north to the Trossachs in the East; the Inner Hebridean islands and Northern Ireland in the west to the Lake District and beyond in the south; an area of some 98,000 square miles (254,000 sq km).",Queen’s Commendation for Bravery in the Air,Other,,id25_247

Personnel will start to deploy to the site this week, with the remaining 1,000 additional personnel being accommodated in buildings on military bases, Territorial Army Centres, and in specially procured temporary accommodation in Hainault, Essex.

Mr Hammond said:

Including the additional 3,500 personnel announced last week, around 17,000 members of the Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force are now involved in the Olympic security effort.

Working alongside the police and civilian contractors, this is a complex task, and since last week’s uplift in the military contribution we have been working hard to ensure that our Armed Forces are accommodated appropriately and as comfortably as possible, with access to sufficient rest and recreational facilities, and that their collective contributions to a successful Olympics is appropriately recognised.

I am confident that the Tobacco Dock will allow us to do that and our priority over the coming days is to ensure that happens as quickly as possible. Our Armed Forces are used to short-notice deployments and dealing with the unexpected which is why I am confident they will do a superb job in assisting in the provision of security for the world’s largest sporting event.

Use of the 16,000-square-metre site, a 10-minute walk from Tower Bridge, follows an agreement with Tobacco Dock Venue Limited.

The Government has already made a commitment that no member of the Armed Forces will lose leave or be left out of pocket as a result of an Olympics deployment, and work continues on a broader welfare package with further steps to recognise the military’s contribution.

In addition, CTR is now extended to include Operation ELLAMY, the UK element of the NATO operation in Libya to protect civilians and enforce United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973.

Increasing the CTR rate is just one of the commitments announced in the Armed Forces Covenant: Today and Tomorrow published on 16 May.

The Minister for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans, Andrew Robathan, said:

The core principle of the covenant is that members of the Armed Forces Community do not suffer disadvantage as a result of their service. By increasing the level of Council Tax Relief, we are underlining that key principle.

Other measures being introduced as part of the Armed Forces Covenant include:

The MOD administers a CTR scheme for all Regular and Reserve Service personnel serving in qualifying operational locations overseas (such as Iraq, Afghanistan, and now including Libya), who either pay or are counted for Council Tax or Rates for a property in the UK or the equivalent contribution if they are in Service Families Accommodation.

The daily rate of CTR has previously been based on 25 per cent of the average Council Tax per dwelling in England. With effect from 1 July this will increase to 50 per cent, which amounts to approximately £296 for an average six-month tour for Service personnel on eligible operations overseas.

CTR is paid as a tax-free lump sum on completion of duty, based on the number of days in the qualifying operational location. The process of applying for CTR for those eligible has not changed.

All Service personnel who own or rent a private property remain liable to pay Council Tax (or Rates in Northern Ireland) on their own property to the local authority.

Those eligible to claim CTR are all Regular Service personnel, mobilised Reserves and Full-Time Reserve Service (Full or Limited Commitment) personnel serving in operational locations specified by the MOD who pay Council Tax (or Rates in Northern Ireland) for a private property or Contributions in Lieu of Council Tax for Service Families Accommodation.",Increase in Council Tax Relief (CTR) rate,Welfare,,id25_249

The highway and surrounding land had become littered with the hulks of burnt-out and written-off vehicles - remnants of years of war, improvised explosive device blasts and road traffic accidents.

After it was resolved to clear the area, the decision was taken to help boost the local economy by employing a local contractor to carry out the work, rather than employ military labour.

British soldiers from 2 R WELSH were on the scene to oversee the hulks’ removal.

Spokesman for Task Force Helmand, Lieutenant Colonel David Eastman, said:

Security has improved markedly along Highway 1 in the past few months due to the establishment of new checkpoints along the route, as well as successful operations into the surrounding area by the Royal Welsh and their Afghan National Army partners.

The hulk removal has not only removed possible sources of cover for insurgent attacks on the road, but will also improve the perception of security for road users and local people.

Sharon Kean reports on how combat logistic patrols (CLPs) do their work.",Ministry of Defence,8 July 2010,"A convoy of military vehicles stuck in the middle of the Afghan desert is a sitting duck - an easy target for the Taliban. So, the lorries and armoured support vehicles that take supplies to soldiers on the front line don’t stop, unless it’s absolutely necessary:

Troops eat on the go, they pee on the go,” said Captain Julie Booton, a reservist attached to 12 Logistic Support Regiment during its current stint in Helmand.

She monitors the convoys and tracks their progress from an operations tent in Camp Bastion:

Even the girls are issued with bottles and ‘she-wees’ [cardboard funnels],” said Captain Booton.

Some of the female drivers were concerned at first, but we try to put them in cabs together. It’s harsh but they get on with it and get used to it.

Private Jessica Cheek is a communications specialist who travels in a Mastiff armoured vehicle as part of the force protection team that guards convoys on their long haul journeys:

There’s quite a few of us in there,” she said, pointing to the Mastiff’s forward cab and compact rear compartment.

Driver, vehicle commander, force protection commander up on the top, an interpreter, someone monitoring updates from other patrols, and myself.

Convoy loads are not limited to ammunition, fuel, food and water, although these must take priority. Just as often the trucks will carry earth-moving vehicles used to build and develop smaller bases across Helmand.

Combat logistic patrols, generally of 50 or more vehicles, leave the main British and US base at Camp Bastion every week or so. They may be gone for a week, and must be self-reliant.

Major Joe Chestnutt is a regular convoy commander:

They can be very long trips - more than 40 hours,” he said. “We travel slowly because there are threats all along the routes. We carry out checks, which add time, as do any incidents along the way.

The vehicles tend to begin their trips under cover of darkness, minimising any immediate Taliban threat. However, travelling by night poses its own risk. It is much harder to spot signs on the ground that might indicate an improvised explosive device (IED):

Adrenalin and some good banter with the boys keeps you awake,” said Major Chestnutt.

He led one of the biggest convoys ever to leave Camp Bastion, a 217-vehicle patrol with over a 60-hour outbound journey. That combined UK-US operation saw 609 soldiers travel 90km north of Bastion to Musa Qal’ah.

The convoy took earth-moving machinery and power-generating plants to the American Marines who were moving into the area, and brought back British equipment. The round-trip took more than a week:

We can’t just use the easiest routes, because that would make us an obvious target,” said troop commander Lieutenant Dave Webster.

This means drivers and their vehicles must battle with the harshest aspects of the Afghan landscape - dried-up river beds and steep ascents and descents over rock-strewn tracks.

Desert sand brings its own problems, said Lieutenant Webster. Drivers have to deal with sand being blown up by the wind, making visibility very poor:

The soft desert sand makes manoeuvring very difficult,” said Lieutenant Webster. “It makes it hard to see the vehicle in front, and also makes it hard to spot booby traps, even in daylight.

Excitement and even enthusiasm are almost palpable as the soldiers get ready for their night-time departure. The padre blesses every vehicle and hands out sweets. Sometimes (but not tonight) there’s a piper at the gates. It all adds to the buzz of anticipation and the vital sense of cameraderie.

A soldier, brandishing two glow sticks, marshalls the enormous armoured trucks out of the camp’s main gates. One by one, they leave to a chorus of horns and cheers from those left behind.

Those remaining in camp hone driving skills, maintain vehicles and generally prepare for the next time they must dodge the bullets and IEDs:

The insurgents’ home-made bombs have had a massive effect on the way the regiment works,” said Captain Booton.

Understanding the threat and learning how to counter it is a huge part of our training. The threat dominates everything we do, from the metal-detecting drills to the way we drive.

It’s not uncommon for a convoy to be hit by three or four IEDs during a patrol, and to come under small arms attack between ten and 15 times. Generally, it is the vehicles that are damaged rather than the crews inside,” said Captain Guy Mason, one of the officers who helps plan the combat logistic patrols.

Although last time two casualties had to be evacuated by helicopter and flown back to Camp Bastion.

Clearly, the insurgents’ objective is to stop such convoys leaving camp at all, isolating the forward operating bases and making it impossible for civilian and military teams to bring development aid to local civilians.

That the juggernauts continue rumbling through the gates and into the Afghan desert is evidence that, so far at least, the insurgency has failed.

The vehicle depot in Tiji was struck on Wednesday, 25 May 2011, by a Tornado GR4 and a Typhoon FGR4 which between them dropped nine bombs on the facility.

In a demonstration of the flexibility of the RAF’s combination of Tornado and Typhoon, the mission was originally tasked to strike eight points. A ninth was added based on information received during the mission.

The Typhoon dropped four Enhanced Paveway II bombs, the first time it has done that operationally, while the Tornado used five Paveway IV bombs, again a first for that aircraft. Both weapon types have laser and GPS guidance for accuracy.

All nine struck their intended target points on the Gaddafi-regime storage facility, and the complementary capabilities of the 1,000-pound (454kg) Enhanced Paveway II and 500-pound (227kg) Paveway IV bombs ensured that the facility was completely destroyed.

The vehicle depot at Tiji had been supporting regime attacks on the civilian population in the Jebel Nafusa region, south west of Tripoli.

These strikes take the total RAF strikes in deliberate operations in a 36-hour period to 17, all of them direct hits. At the same time, the RAF has maintained its commitment to dynamic targeting missions. In that role RAF pilots have destroyed Gaddafi-regime artillery threatening Misurata.

On Tuesday, 24 May 2011, RAF aircraft attacked four of Colonel Gaddafi’s heavy armoured vehicles deployed near the Libyan city of Zlitan - all four were destroyed or badly damaged.

On the same day RAF Tornado and Typhoon jets also attacked a Libyan coastal radar station near Brega, which was destroyed with a single dual-mode seeker Brimstone missile. While the missile is designed for use against vehicles, and usually only used in that role, it was chosen as the most appropriate weapon for a precision strike.

The relatively small warhead on the Brimstone missile meant that the aircrew could destroy the radar unit without destroying the building, and also ensure the risk of death and injury was minimised.

Last Friday, 20 May 2011, two RAF aircraft struck at five multiple rocket launchers in the vicinity of Tripoli.

The Chief of the Defence Staff’s Strategic Communications Officer, Major General John Lorimer, said:

Officer Commanding II (AC) Squadron, Wing Commander Nick Tucker-Lowe, said:

This is an important year for us and the other founding squadrons of the RAF as we’ve just celebrated our centenary. In a few months’ time the unit will deploy on its second Operation HERRICK tour hard on the heels of a six-month stint on Operation ELLAMY over Libya last year.

When we were last in Afghanistan we were launched from ground alert to close air support missions in support of troops on the ground on close to 100 occasions.

That’s something we’re practising very hard this week - the ability to get in the air very quickly because lives are in danger. Then we can use our speed, reach and precision-guided weapons, or often our presence alone, to protect the troops on the ground.

But despite being veterans of two campaigns there’s still a need for realistic training which is provided by a team of trainers from the HQ Air Command Joint Force Air Component (JFAC):

It is vital that we teach our people to fight not just shoulder-to-shoulder but for one another and that our people are not only competent at the necessary skills but confident at using them,” said Wing Commander Tucker-Lowe.

The JFAC trainers bring a broader array of skills than the squadron would be able to corral on its own. That means I can include things like media training, realistic combat first aid training, and exercising some of the worse case scenarios so we are confident that we can deal with these before we go.

War Week exercise director, Squadron Leader Simon Reade, said the training developed after changes to the RAF’s exercise programme resulted in a switch from training whole Expeditionary Air Wings to focusing on what individual squadrons needed in order to deploy to Afghanistan:

War Week is a collective training opportunity for a squadron to generate air power in an environment like the one they will face in Kandahar,” Squadron Leader Reade said.

It’s a difficult week in some respects for those being trained, but one that emphasises the teamwork, confidence-building and communications between all the elements of the squadron that they will require on operations.

Keeping the locals onside is a big part of what we need to do here to provide security.

They’re effectively our outer cordon of security. By keeping them onside, they will inform us of any insurgents that move into the area, or anything that’s untoward. So having a positive relationship with them is crucial.

The soldiers from Camp Souter are engaged in work known as ‘Consent Winning Activity’, carrying out projects that directly improve locals’ quality of life:

In the five months we’ve been here we’ve seen a huge amount of change,” said Captain Hick.

The local population are very pro-British forces in this area.

Sergeant Kevin Bond and Signaller Mark Kershaw, both from the Joint Support Unit, have been helping to distribute essential items to dozens of families at Kujah Rawesh school, located just outside Camp Souter:

We’ve given them some rice, oil and blankets, along with some gifts,” said Sergeant Bond.

It makes a massive difference, because they’ve not got a great deal of money themselves. And it certainly makes a difference for us as well when we’re out patrolling, interacting with them.

I’ve seen a lot of change, especially with the local elders,” he added. “They’ve become a lot more friendly towards us, and we’ve enjoyed much better relations with people outside the camp walls.

Signaller Kershaw explained:

A lot of the people out here don’t have much, so for us to come here and help them is really good. It shows that we’re not just here to fight people, we’re here to try to improve life for the local population.

Sergeant Michael Corker, who works for the Expeditionary Force Institute (EFI), the Army unit of reservists that takes the NAAFI into dangerous war zones, such as Afghanistan, said:

When we first got into Afghanistan in 2001, we just had a Land Rover with a trailer and went into Kabul where the armoured vehicles and troops were, and sold stuff out of the back of the wagon.

The NAAFI has shops in notorious areas of Helmand province, such as Sangin. And, despite the relative austerity of the front line, the shop in Forward Operating Base (FOB) Jackson stocks 300-400 different products:

It’s hard work when you’ve got rockets flying around, but you’ve got your body armour and protection. You get used to the rockets, but you never get used to the weight of the armour and the heat,” said Sergeant Corker.

He has served all over the world with the EFI, in countries as far-removed as Bosnia and Belize. In his 13 years with the NAAFI there have been changes. He said:

We’ve got proper buildings now instead of tents. And you can get proper lattes and cappuccinos.

Troops in the middle of Helmand’s Green Zone can also buy household toiletries, soft drinks, chocolate bars and crisps found in the UK. Top-sellers are Pot Noodles and cigarettes:

The guys out there take them out on the ground with them,” said Sergeant Corker.

When the NAAFI arrived in Sangin, it got a warm welcome from the troops, who, despite being less than 100km away, were far removed from the comforts of Camp Bastion, which has two NAAFI shops, as well as a Pizza Hut and a curry house:

The troops appreciate it,” explained Sergeant Corker. “You get the odd person that complains about prices, but they’re higher due to the logistics of getting supplies to the middle of the desert. It’s not like you can just walk to Tesco’s and load up the trolley.

Two hundred UK troops is the guideline figure to qualify for a NAAFI presence, so as more bases grow they are likely to get shops:

Jackson was so successful that a week after it opened there was discussion of where the next one would be,” said Lieutenant Colonel Kevin Pembroke, the officer in charge of the EFI.

There will be a NAAFI in FOB Shawqat by August, so we need to make sure we have enough EFI staff trained to the standard required to deploy to FOBs.

What we can’t do is put a civilian member of NAAFI into somewhere like FOB Jackson.

There’s no option; they’ve got to be a full-on part of the military and fully trained as per any other member of the military. They’ve got to be able to play that part in defending the base if it’s attacked and deal with the pressure of that operational environment.

In the speech Mr Harvey spoke about the need to redefine what is meant by the critical infrastructure of the nation and how it is protected in the digital age.

Discussing the clear benefits of the internet and digital technology, Mr Harvey also pointed out that cyberspace is abused by people, because, he said, cyber crime, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism, cyber vandalism, even the use of cyber in warfare, are all just human pursuits - simply crime, espionage, terrorism, vandalism and conflict by another means. He added:

The difference is the method, not the outcome or the intent - stealing money is stealing money regardless of whether it is done by pickpocketing or hacking.

So I do not agree with those who say we need a massive raft of new criminal offences relating to the internet.

What we do need is to become smarter in preventing, detecting and prosecuting the use of cyberspace for criminal ends. This is why we are investing in capabilities that enable law enforcement agencies to combat criminal activity in cyberspace.

Mr Harvey said that a great deal of the current threat can be dealt with through the application of what he’d call basic ‘cyber hygiene’.

This, he said, is the commonsense application of security measures that are simple to follow and easy to implement:

Mr Harvey continued:

Cyber hygiene needs to be applied both at home and at work because what cyberspace is doing is breaking down the barriers between someone’s job and their personal life.

For example, a member of the Armed Forces gossiping on MSN, posting on Facebook, or tweeting for the benefit of their family and friends needs to be aware that, because of their job, others may well be tuning in - opponents, adversaries, terrorists.

An attack on your computer at home may well be designed to hack into your personal finances, but equally you might have been targeted because of what you do for a living.

Mr Harvey added:

The MOD’s own networks are under daily attack as are networks across government. Between 2009 and 2010, cyber-related security incidents more than doubled at the MOD.

The MOD’s new Global Operations and Security Control Centre provides a state-of-the-art facility in which we are able to bring together all the essential capabilities required to protect our own defence systems, but we know we will need to do more.

We must accept that the security measures we are expected to adhere to at work apply equally, and, just as importantly, at home.

This is the thrust behind the new campaign in my own department - changing behaviours, changing mindsets.

Last month the MOD launched a new campaign to remind Armed Forces personnel, their families and friends about keeping a close hold on information - not just relating to work, but to personal lives too.

Mr Harvey said that those of us with responsibility for national security must ensure resilience and security in our critical national infrastructure (CNI). He said:

Traditionally when we talk of our CNI we are referring to the utility network, transport systems and the energy grids that power the country and keep us going.

Protecting this has been about physical sites and physical assets around the country - power stations, reservoirs, distribution centres. But the context has changed. We need to think differently about what it is essential to protect and how we do that.

The digital networks which sustain our critical national infrastructure should be considered part of that infrastructure itself. Networked telecommunications underpin the UK business and banking system, they underpin the process of government, they underpin public access to everyday services and they underpin our security posture.

Mr Harvey said this is about making sure our emergency services can effectively respond to a serious disaster situation and about making sure we consider the importance of digital networks to the financial system the country relies on, and it is about making sure there is resilience in the digital networks that allow day-to-day governance to continue, in Westminster and across the country.

Mr Harvey said:

Our approach to security in the physical world and in cyberspace needs to be seamless.

TheNational Security Strategyhas made a start in this process, elevating cyber attack into the top rank of threats to national security and creating the new National Cyber Security Programme.

The MOD has created the Defence Cyber Operations Group to ensure that our own departmental work is linked in.

The new National Cyber Security Strategy currently being developed will take forward this comprehensive, cross-government approach.

Its key themes - economic prosperity, increased national security and the protection and promotion of our way of life - embrace the kind of expanded concept that I outlined earlier.

We have to be careful we don’t overextend ourselves or lose focus on what is essential to protect. But we must do so with a new mindset, not just concentrating on protecting concrete and steel, but encompassing cyberspace too.

Mr Harvey also spoke about working together, saying because the cyber challenge has further blurred security boundaries, it means we have to break out of our silos, break down barriers and break new ground in the creation of a new security partnership between government, business, academia and private citizens, adding:

The first step to improving national cyber security will be to get organisations properly sharing information on common threats so that combined responses can be made.

To be successful this project must cover as many sectors of the UK economy as possible.

He also said we need to think and act internationally because cyberspace is international space, adding:

My department has been working closely with allies to develop enhanced cyber relationships and there will be important announcements in the coming months.

The UK has also now ratified the Budapest Convention on Cyber Crime which is a good example of a multilateral organisation making a real contribution in the way in which we can work together.

But all this work needs to be guided by discussion of how states should act in cyberspace. The international cyber conference which the Foreign Secretary announced the UK will host later this year will be an important first step in beginning the process of establishing principles that all nations should adhere to in cyberspace.",Campaign to change behaviours and mindsets regarding cyber hygiene.,Informational,,id25_257

One of these is for Medical Assistant Liam O’Grady, a Royal Navy medic who saved the lives of four colleagues after they were seriously injured in Afghanistan following a grenade attack.

A Military Cross is awarded in recognition of exemplary gallantry during active operations against the enemy on land.

Medical Assistant O’Grady, aged 21, had been in the Royal Navy for just two years when he was sent on his first deployment to Afghanistan in the summer of 2011. He was attached to an Army patrol occupying Checkpoint Richka, a tiny compound in the Green Zone of the Upper Gereshk Valley.

The incident which has earned him a Military Cross involved him, despite shrapnel wounds to his leg and face, running across open ground while grenades were exploding around him to drag his stricken patrol sergeant to safety.

He gave immediate lifesaving treatment to the commander who had severe wounds to his chest and abdomen before going on to attend to three other badly wounded men, two with severe injuries to their legs and one with shrapnel wounds to his face.

It was only after the commander had been extracted by helicopter and he had helped carry the further three casualties 800 metres uphill through hostile territory that he allowed his own wounds to be treated. Medical Assistant O’Grady said:

We were all really close as there was only ever about 13 of us together at any one time so you get to know each other really well. When we came under attack from the grenades I was on the radio and immediately shouted to them that we had an emergency.

I had sprinted out to get my first aid pack when I saw that the patrol sergeant was lying on the ground and in real trouble. He was struggling to breathe and there was a significant amount of blood loss.

The shrapnel had penetrated his chest and lung and I knew I had to try and get some fluids and morphine into him; it’s to his credit that he was a strong man - he was really fighting for his life.

I knew my leg was bleeding and it hurt to put any weight on it, but it was my job to help these guys and I think that instinct just took over.

According to his citation Medical Assistant O’Grady displayed ‘exemplary gallantry, selflessness and devotion to duty’.

His ‘instinctive bravery and total disregard for his own safety, followed by exceptional handling of a mass-casualty situation as a lone medic while wounded and under threat of further attack’ undoubtedly saved the life of his patrol sergeant.

Medical Assistant O’Grady added:

When they told me I was getting a Military Cross I think I went into shock, I was so surprised. There were so many people there that day that helped carry the stretchers that carried the medical equipment that fired back at the enemy - it was a team effort so in my mind I am accepting this on behalf of them all.

One of the Army’s oldest forms of recognition for gallantry, the Mention in Despatches, has been awarded to Manchester hero Warrant Officer Class 1 Jonathan Lane from the Army Air Corps.

Since 1993 the Mention in Despatches has been reserved for gallantry during active operations. WO1 Lane, aged 37, is receiving the award for his actions during an Apache helicopter mission over Libya when he faced off a Libyan ground-to-air missile attack.

WO1 Lane was the front seat aircraft commander in the second of a pair of Apache helicopters directed to target an enemy command and control centre between Misurata and Zlitan. As the helicopter began its attack run, WO1 Lane was engaged by an SA-24 surface-to-air missile.

Holding his nerve as the missile soared towards him, he was able to identify its firing point before using the aircraft’s flares to decoy the missile and return fire.

WO1 Lane, who has a nine-year-old son Ethan, with wife Claire, feared he would never see them again in the seconds before the flare drew the missile away from the Apache. He said:

It all happened really quickly, probably about five to six seconds, but, as I saw the missile heading for us, I did think this could be it.

Although I had come under small arms fire and anti-aircraft artillery attack before, this was the first time I had experienced a surface-to-air missile and, despite going through that scenario in a simulator, it was a real shock.

The flare was deployed and I watched as the missile swerved at the last second. The adrenaline was pumping, my heart was thumping out of my chest. There was a sense of tremendous relief, followed by the realisation that it could happen again, so we broke away from that zone but still had another aircraft engaging the target in that area.

WO1 Lane then had to make the decision to go back, identify the enemy and neutralise the threat. He added:

It was very frightening. We had got away with it once. We did not know what else was there but knew the assets the enemy had access to. But because of the kit on the aircraft, we had been able to pinpoint the enemy position quickly after they fired on us. We found a rocket launcher which had been used to shoot at ships off the coast and destroyed it.

His actions allowed the helicopters to carry on with their original mission before returning to the missile firing point to destroy its capabilities.

The citation for his actions states:

During this time, he was both accurate and discriminatory in his use of force while placing himself and his aircraft in genuine danger of a further SA-24 engagement.

Flight Lieutenant Jonathan Singh, a Chinook pilot in the RAF, has been awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross. This award is made in recognition of exemplary gallantry during active operations against the enemy in the air.

His award is for his actions during a helicopter assault with the Brigade Reconnaissance Force (BRF) onto a suspected improvised explosive device factory in Afghanistan last June.

The factory was located in a high-threat area with few coalition troops on the ground. Not wanting to leave the BRF with only half its strength on the ground, Flight Lieutenant Singh displayed exceptional courage by continuing with landing and disembarking his troops.

Within seconds of touching down, the aircraft came under heavy fire, but Flight Lieutenant Singh remained on the ground despite bullets impacting all around him, including one which hit the cockpit two inches (5cm) below his right foot.

Once all the troops were off the ramp, he discovered his helicopter had suffered severe control damage, making it almost unflyable. Using the full force of both hands on the flight controls, he eventually managed to nurse his aircraft to the relative safety of the open desert.

However, poor weather conditions in the desert meant that the only safe option for landing would be to fly to a nearby patrol base. The helicopter was so badly damaged that Flight Lieutenant Singh could not achieve a safe landing within the base.

Carefully co-ordinating his co-pilot to fly the collective control lever, and using all his strength to control the aircraft, he was able land the aircraft close to the patrol base and provide his crew with the necessary protection.

They had just dropped off a supply of fresh meat and water to fellow troops and were entering an alleyway close to their base when the insurgents, who were lying in wait, opened fire:

The rounds of fire were coming in and they were quite close - I quickly got down onto my belt buckle to avoid being hit,” explained Marine Milburn. “They were firing down the alley - seconds passed and we organised ourselves and started to peel back, just like we are taught in training.

As we passed another opening, the incoming fire continued. I got into a fire position by the entrance to the patrol base, waiting to ensure that everyone got back in.

This meant that I was the last man back into the safety of the patrol base. Moments later there was a big thud - I glanced back and saw a massive hole in the wall a few feet from where I’d been standing.

It was a strange experience - I felt a weird buzz. It was the adrenaline pumping through me. But we have to keep calm and focus.

Out on the ground you are always thinking about what your next move would be if you come under fire, but when it actually happened the training all just kicked in and it was all flowing. In the end everyone returned to the base uninjured which is the main point.

Marine Milburn, who hails from Middlesbrough, joined the Royal Marines when he was just 16 and has never looked back. He said:

Being in the Marines is awesome, I love it. There’s good camaraderie.

I’ve got good friends back at home, but these are the best mates I’ll ever have.

His father, a Sergeant Major, served with the Green Jackets for 22 years and was Marine Milburn’s inspiration to join the military.

The crew of the Mark 5 Sea King was tasked by the Aeronautical Rescue Co-ordination Centre at Kinloss on the request of Cardonald Ambulance Service and was airborne for the short hop from the crew’s Prestwick base.

A matter of only four miles later, the helicopter landed at the golf course where a doctor and paramedic were already in attendance.

It appeared that the teenager may have had a bump to the head and he was, therefore, handled for suspected spinal injuries.

Together with the medical staff on site, the helicopter’s paramedic aircrewman and observer carefully prepared the lad for removal on a stretcher.

Chief Petty Officer Daz Craig, the HMS Gannet duty paramedic, said:

It was snowing and visibility in the showers was not great, the flying conditions looked grim, but we were briefed and reassured by the duty forecaster Chief Petty Officer Tim Anthoney and managed to avoid some of the worst weather.

There were a lot of people at the landing site, but they all moved back to a safe distance allowing us to land next to the casualty. An ambulance and duty doctor were already on-scene attending to the casualty.

Lieutenant Alex Stevenson (winch operator) and myself went over to the casualty and prepared him for loading in the stretcher for the short flight to Glasgow Southern General, avoiding the snow showers.

All in all a reasonably straightforward job despite the sometimes poor visibility and snow showers.

Flying straight from the scene, the helicopter travelled to Glasgow where the teenager was kept in hospital overnight and released the next day.

In 2009, HMS Gannet broke its own record of the previous two years for the highest number of call outs, with 447, rescuing 378 people, and making it the UK busiest helicopter search and rescue unit since records began.",Search and Rescue Helicopter Operations (HMS Gannet),Institutional,Other,id25_260

On 16 December I and my Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Defence announced that information had come to light regarding the preferred bid in the Search and Rescue Helicopter competition which required clarification.

In mid-December, the preferred bidder in the SAR-H competition, Soteria, voluntarily came forward to inform the Government of irregularities regarding the conduct of their bid team which had only then recently come to light. The irregularities included access by one of the consortium members, CHC Helicopter, to commercially sensitive information regarding the joint MOD/DfT project team’s evaluations of industry bids and evidence that a former member of that project team had assisted the consortium in its bid preparation, contrary to explicit assurances given to the project team at the time.

Since December, our two Departments have been working with Soteria to better understand the situation and its implications for the procurement process. In addition, the Ministry of Defence Police are investigating how the commercially sensitive information came to be in the possession of the bidder. It would be inappropriate to comment further on the details of the investigation until it has finished.

However, even without the outcome of that investigation, the Government has sufficient information to enable it to conclude that the irregularities that have been identified were such that it would not be appropriate to proceed with either the preferred bid or with the current procurement process.

The Department for Transport and the Ministry of Defence will now consider the potential procurement options to meet future requirements for search and rescue helicopters in the United Kingdom, including options to maintain continuity of search and rescue helicopter cover until new longer term arrangements can be put in place.

Acting Chief Executive Defence Infrastructure Organisation Andrew Manley said:

The creation of the DIO will over time bring a radical new approach to the way we manage infrastructure and estates services across the MOD. All staff have an important role to play in bringing about that change.

The creation of the DIO marks the first major milestone delivered under the Transforming Defence programme, led by Lord Levene.

Air Member for Personnel & Deputy Commander-in-Chief Personnel, and member of the Defence Infrastructure Board (DIB), Air Marshal Andy Pulford said:

The formation of the DIO is an essential first step in the Defence Reform agenda, and an important one. Infrastructure plays a vital role in the generation and delivery of Air Power. This requires targeted investment to optimise and deliver an affordable and sustainable estate which will not only allow us to do the job but, critically, to support our Service personnel and their families, both now, and into the future.

The new organisation provides the Armed Forces with a “one stop shop” which will manage most infrastructure services across Defence and has been established to:

• Reduce estate running costs;

• Ensure more efficient use of the Defence estate;

• Deliver a better service to infrastructure users;

• Establish quicker and more responsive ways of working; and

• Ensure more efficient use of Defence resources.

Speaking about the formation of the DIO, Adjutant General and member of the DIB, Lieutenant General Mark Mans CBE said:

Our operational capability depends on our Infrastructure. It plays a critical role in supporting the Army’s preparations for operations in Afghanistan, and in delivering a better life for our soldiers and their families at home. The Defence Infrastructure Organisation presents us with an opportunity to improve this support and to deliver it more efficiently. I am confident that we have the right people and skills in place to rise to the challenge.

DIO will oversee the physical maintenance of buildings and equipment as well as the support services, such as cleaning and catering along with energy and water for the estate. It also supports vital military tasks on an overseas estate that spans Germany, Cyprus, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar and operational theatres such as Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the management of infrastructure Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contracts.

Second Sea Lord, and also a member of the DIB, Vice Admiral Charles Montgomery CBE ADC, said:

Trust, transparency and a close working relationship between the DIO, Industry and the end user TLBs (including the Single Services) will be essential to enable us to focus our investment on where it is most needed and ensure that Service personnel, and their families, continue to feel valued. It is at the training establishment, the base and the barrack that we generate our military capability, for the present and the future.

The formation of DIO will bring together around 7,000 staff, the vast majority of whom are civilian, working on construction, maintenance and disposal of land and buildings across the MOD. Most staff are from the former Defence Estates organisation, with infrastructure staff from across the MOD also joining the organisation.",Creation of the Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO),Institutional,Other,id25_262

As part of the deal, eligible workers on the Agenda for Change contract, which includes nurses, paramedics, 999 call handlers, midwives, security guards and cleaners, will receive the pay rise, backdated to April.

As a result of this package, a newly qualified nurse will see their salary go up by more than £2,750 over 2 years from 2021 to 2022 to 2023 to 2024. They will also receive over £1,890 in one-off payments this year.

In addition, they will receive a one-off ‘NHS backlog bonus’ which recognises the sustained pressure facing the NHS following the pandemic and the extraordinary effort staff have been making to meet the Prime Minister’s promise to cut waiting lists.

The backlog bonus will be worth at least £1,250 per person, but will be determined based on how much experience staff have and based on an individual’s pay band. The average nurse in pay band 5, for example, will receive £1,350.

Health and Social Care Secretary Steve Barclay said:

More than one million of our hard-working NHS staff will begin to receive more money in their pay packet from today, including a backlog bonus for all their efforts during the pandemic.

We’re giving nurses, paramedics, physiotherapists and other eligible staff a fair pay rise, which will see, for example, band 6 staff getting an extra £5,000 over 2 years.

We hugely value the work of NHS staff and the vital role they’re playing to cut waiting lists, which is one of the government’s 5 priorities, and recognise the work they put in day in and day out.

Under the deal, eligible Agenda for Change staff will receive a non-consolidated award of 2% of an individual’s salary for 2022 to 2023. This is on top of the pay increase of at least £1,400 (pro-rated for staff working part-time) staff received for 2022 to 2023, as recommended by the independent pay review body process. This meant a newly qualified nurse received a 5.5% increase, and those on the lowest salaries received a pay rise of 9.3%.

For 2023 to 2024, the government has given Agenda for Change staff a 5% consolidated increase in pay, worth at least £1,065.

The deal will also provide a higher pay uplift for the lowest paid NHS staff, with all those in bands 1 and 2 having their pay raised to the same level.

The pay increase was reached following constructive talks with unions and organisations including UNISON, GMB, the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy and the British Dietetic Association.",Pay rise and one-off payments to NHS staff,Welfare,Monetary,id25_263

The plans, drawn up by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), will make sure all consumer smart devices sold in the UK adhere to the three rigorous security requirements for the Internet of Things (IoT).

These are:

All consumer internet-connected device passwords must be unique and not resettable to any universal factory setting

Manufacturers of consumer IoT devices must provide a public point of contact so anyone can report a vulnerability and it will be acted on in a timely manner

Manufacturers of consumer IoT devices must explicitly state the minimum length of time for which the device will receive security updates at the point of sale, either in store or online

The sale of connected devices is on the rise. Research suggests there will be 75 billion internet connected devices, such as televisions, cameras, home assistants and their associated services, in homes around the world by the end of 2025.

Digital Minister Matt Warman said:

We want to make the UK the safest place to be online with pro-innovation regulation that breeds confidence in modern technology.

Our new law will hold firms manufacturing and selling internet-connected devices to account and stop hackers threatening people’s privacy and safety.

It will mean robust security standards are built in from the design stage and not bolted on as an afterthought.

The measures were developed in conjunction with the business industry and the National Cyber Security Centre  and set a new standard for best practice requirements for companies that manufacture and sell consumer smart devices or products.

Following on from the consultation, Government’s ambition is to further develop legislation that effectively protects consumers, is implementable by industry and supports the long term growth of the IoT. Government aims to deliver this legislation as soon as possible.

Nicola Hudson, Policy and Communications Director at the NCSC, said:

Smart technology is increasingly central to the way we live our lives, so the development of this legislation to ensure that we are better protected is hugely welcomed.

It will give shoppers increased peace of mind that the technology they are bringing into their homes is safe, and that issues such as pre-set passwords and sudden discontinuation of security updates are a thing of the past.

This  follows the government’s voluntary Secure by Design Code of Practice for consumer IoT security launched in 2018. The Code advocates for stronger cyber security measures to be built into smart products at the design stage, and has already been backed by Centrica Hive, HP Inc Geo and more recently Panasonic.

The Government is working with international partners to ensure that the guidelines drive a consistent, global approach to IoT security. This includes a partnership with standards bodies. In February 2019 ETSI, a global standards organisation published the first globally-applicable industry standard on consumer IoT security, which is based on the UK Government’s Code of Practice.

Matthew Evans, director of markets, techUK said:

Consumer IoT devices can deliver real benefits to individuals and society but techUK’s research shows that concerns over poor security practices act as a significant barrier to their take-up.  techUK is therefore supportive of the Government’s commitment to legislate for cyber security to be built into consumer IoT products from the design stage.

techUK has been working on these three principles for the past four years. We support the work to ensure that they are consistent and are influencing international standards.

We look forward to working closely with Government and industry to ensure the implementation of the legislation provides protection for consumers whilst continuing to promote innovation within the IoT sector.

John Moor, Managing Director, IoT Security Foundation said:

Over the past five years, there has been a great deal of concern expressed toward vulnerable consumers and inadequate cybersecurity protection. Understanding the complex nature of IoT security and determining the minimum requirements has been a challenge, yet, after a thorough and robust consultation, those baseline requirements have now been universally agreed.

The IoT Security Foundation welcomes the results of the consultation as it not only provides clarity for industry, it is great news for consumers and bad news for hackers.",Three rigorous security requirements for the Internet of Things (IoT),Legislative,Other,id25_264

As part of the review the Committee would like to hear from individuals, organisations and other bodies with views on Passported Benefits under Universal Credit. The consultation period begins on 16 June and ends on 22 July 2011.

Those wishing to make representations to the Committee should consider the key consultation questions, available from the SSAC website:ssac.independent.gov.uk, or from the Secretary to the Committee, Gill Saunders (0207 962 8345).

SSAC

The SSAC is the UK’s statutory advisory body on social security and related matters, such as links with the labour market and wider social welfare issues. The Committee provides advice to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions - and to the Department for Social Development in Northern Ireland - on their functions generally. It also plays a unique role in the secondary legislation process, performing a mandatory scrutiny of most proposals for making the regulations that underpin the social welfare system that is the responsibility of the DWP.

The Committee is independent of both Government and sectional interests. Members come from a variety of backgrounds, but collectively they have a considerable depth of knowledge of, and expertise in, both the specifics of policy and law and the wider social policy agenda.

Universal Credit

Universal Credit is a fundamental reform of the benefits system. It will create a single income replacement benefit for working age adults which unifies the current system of means-tested out of work benefits, tax credits and support for housing. Detailed implementation plans are being developed and the first new claims to Universal Credit are expected to begin from October 2013. The transition to the new system will take around five years to complete.

Universal Credit will improve work incentives by allowing individuals to keep more of their income as they move into work and by introducing a smoother and more transparent reduction of benefits when they increase their earnings.

Passported Benefits

Currently, individuals of working age may be entitled to a number of ‘passported benefits’ when they are in receipt of out of work means-tested benefits or tax credits. A large number of passported benefits are available, administered by a wide range of organisations, including government departments, the devolved administrations, local authorities, and other bodies both within and outside of government, including commercial organisations. Passported benefits can be differentiated into: benefits in kind such as free school meals, free milk, fruit and vegetables, and vitamins, free prescriptions; cash benefits such as support for travel costs to hospitals or prisons; and discounts on charges or fees such as leisure discounts.

Government departments and the devolved administrations are responsible for defining entitlement to some of the passported benefits available. When Universal Credit is introduced it will provide a new single system of means-tested support for working-age people in and out of work. As a result, the current criteria for defining eligibility to various passported benefits will no longer exist.",Consultation (SSAC review and engagement with stakeholders),Informational,,id25_266

Work to be completed quickly with those affected to determine appropriate redress for those without criminal convictions

Government confirms £37.5 million subsidy to support Post Office network as company sets out £20 million boost for postmasters

Today the government has officially recognised Capture, the software which preceded Horizon, could have created shortfalls affecting postmasters. It has asked the Post Office to urgently review its files and evidence so the CCRC and SCCRC can ensure no one was wrongfully convicted of a Horizon-style injustice.

Responding to the independent Kroll report into the software, the Business Secretary has promised to provide redress for postmasters who suffered losses as a result of Capture. The government will work swiftly with victims to determine its form and scope, alongside eligibility criteria, by Spring 2025.

The Capture accounting system was rolled out across some Post Office branches from 1992 before it was replaced by Horizon in 1999. The government commissioned the independent report following postmasters coming forward publicly in January indicating they had faced detriment due to the Capture system. In its report, Kroll concluded Capture could have created shortfalls.

The response comes as the government marks £499 million paid to more than 3,300 Horizon victims. We are delivering on our promise to ensure swift and fair redress to postmasters, more than doubling the amount of redress paid out since coming into government 5 months ago.

It is thanks to testimony of postmasters that this has been brought to light and failings have been discovered.

We must now work quickly to provide redress and justice to those who have suffered greatly after being wrongly accused.

I’d like to encourage anyone who believes they have been affected by Capture to share their story with us so we can put wrongs to right once and for all.

It’s taken a long time to reach this point which is why my priority now is to deliver justice and redress to postmasters as swiftly as possible.

We will do everything we can to correct the mistakes of the past and ensure they are not repeated.

Postmasters have raised concerns with me that their income has not kept up with inflation over the past decade. The Government therefore welcomes that the Post Office is going to make a one-off payment to postmasters to increase their remuneration.

Due to the length of time which has passed since the Capture system was in use several issues have complicated the investigation including:

Far greater timescales, meaning a greater population of the users may have sadly died

Loss or destruction of relevant evidence for example relating to shortfalls, suspensions, terminations, prosecutions, and convictions

At least 19 different operational versions of the Capture software during the period

Ambiguous number of users during this period

Unlike Horizon, it is currently uncertain how many criminal prosecutions were based on Capture evidence. These challenges also mean it will be difficult for claimants to corroborate their claims with evidence.

The Post Office has indicated it holds further information on convictions and prosecutions during the Capture period. The government has asked them to carry out their review of these records urgently and send information to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) and Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC).

Ensuring postmasters receive the justice they deserve is an immediate priority for this government. The Kroll report does not take a view whether any possible convictions were unsafe. We will continue to facilitate the provision of information to the CCRC and SCCRC, alongside the Post Office, in connection with the review of cases involving the use of Capture as the approach to redress is developed at pace.

Minister Thomas will also announce the government is supporting the Post Office network with a further £37.5 million subsidy. It comes as the Post Office today announces a £20 million boost for postmasters to address their concerns that their income has not kept up with inflation over the past decade.

Under the Plan for Change, this government will make public services deliver for working people once more. The Post Office is an important British institution at the heart of local communities, but for too long neglect has enabled significant issues to take root.

It includes funding to reduce waiting times by supporting the NHS to deliver an extra 40,000 elective appointments a week. Elective appointments are appointments planned in advance, such as knee replacements.

The Budget also includes:

£1.5 billion to fund new surgical hubs which will help build capacity for over 30,000 additional procedures, and more than 1.25 million additional diagnostic tests (which use CT or MRI scanners)

£70 million to invest in new radiotherapy machines to improve cancer treatment

Over £2 billion for NHS technology and digital improvements to increase productivity and save staff time

Over £600 million increase in local government spending to support social care

£26 million to open new mental health crisis centres

Our new housing package will deliver up to 5,000 new affordable social homes.

It includes £500 million in new funding for theAffordable Homes Programme, bringing total investment in housing supply to over £5 billion.

This will support the delivery of 33,000 new homes through £128 million for housing projects across the country.

We are committing £1.4 billion to rebuild crumbling schools.

The investment will ensure delivery of the existingSchool Rebuilding Programme, with 50 rebuilds a year.

Alongside funding for children’s social care, breakfast clubs and early years childcare, the investment reflects the government’s commitment to putting education back at the forefront of national life, breaking down the barriers to opportunity for all children.

To help make sure pensioners are protected in their retirement, we have also confirmed a 4.1% increase to the basic and new State Pension, as well as the standard minimum guarantee for Pension Credit, from April next year.

Over 12 million pensioners will benefit as the full new State Pension will rise from £221.20 to £230.25 a week, providing an extra £470 a year.

The full basic State Pension will increase from £169.50 to £176.45 per week, worth an extra £360 annually.

We’re ending tax breaks for private schools to better invest in state education.

Currently, private schools are eligible for tax breaks, like charitable business rate relief, and they don’t have to charge VAT on tuition or boarding fees.

From 1 January 2025, all education and boarding services provided by a private school or connected person will be subject to VAT at the standard rate of 20%.

We’re investing over £1 billion to protect vital bus routes and cap bus fares, particularly in rural communities and towns where there is a heavy reliance on buses.

Under the inherited plans, funding for the current cap on bus fares had been due to expire at the end of 2024, with fares set to soar by as much as £13 for the Leeds to Scarborough route, unless the government intervened to keep fares down.

Bus travel will be kept down at £3 at the Budget for an additional year – saving up to 80% on some routes.

This announcement will ensure fares remain affordable from 1 January 2025 and prevent a financial cliff-edge for bus operators that would have seen vital services put at risk across the country.

We’re introducing a new vaping duty to further support our mission to fix the NHS.

To disincentivise activities that cause ill health, we’re introducing a flat rate of 22p/ml from October 2026.

This is accompanied by a further one-off increase in tobacco duty to maintain financial incentive to choose vaping over smoking.

The government is creating a new Fair Repayment Rate which caps deductions made through Universal Credit at 15% of the standard allowance. Before this Budget, it was 25%.

This means approximately 1.2 million households will keep more of their Universal Credit payment each month, with households expected to be better off by an average of over £420 a year.

The Help to Save scheme has been extended and widened. The scheme offers lower earners a savings account where they can save a maximum of £50 a month for four years and receive a 50% government boost at the end of year two and year four.

This helps workers kickstart a lifelong savings habit and offers up to £1,200 over the four years.

The scheme was due to end in April 2025 but has been extended by two years until April 2027. Eligibility for the scheme will widen from April 2025. It will be open to all working Universal Credit claimants earning at least £1 a month.",Introduction of a new Fair Repayment Rate which caps deductions made through Universal Credit at 15% of the standard allowance.,Administrative,,id25_268

The plans, launched today by Cabinet Office Minister Heather Wheeler, are part of the government’s new digital and data strategy. It will see more than £1 billion savings generated by 2025, by eliminating unnecessary costs of paper based services.

As part of this, an estimated £101 million will be saved every year through better procurement, reducing attrition rates of talented staff and less reliance on costly consultants.

The new strategy will deliver significant improvements in digital systems, with the aim of having public services as easy to access as booking a holiday and shopping online.

By 2025, at least 50 of the most frequently used government services will be significantly improved, including by making services easily accessible on mobile devices, a single login available across government services, and bringing in intelligent data sharing making it easier and faster to register to vote and claim legal aid.

The strategy also sets out plans to upskill Civil servants through specialist training workshops, including assessed courses on sourcing good quality data and understanding the technologies that underpin digital services, with a target to equip more than 6,500 senior civil servants with essential digital skills by 2025. Digital standards will be embedded in performance reviews to ensure the way users interact with government services is at the forefront of decision-making.

Minister Heather Wheeler, Parliamentary Under-Secretary in the Cabinet Office, said:

When people order their groceries, book a holiday or check their bank accounts, they expect and receive a seamless and easy experience.  The same should be true of government services.

This new strategy will put us in lockstep with the private sector, transforming the delivery of key services that people rely on so that they are simpler and faster to use while also cutting costs.

The savings of more than £1 billion will also come from better service delivery and the replacement of outdated IT systems, with the adoption of a ‘build once, use many times’ policy helping to reduce duplication of spend across government. The Central Digital and Data Office will work across government to ensure taxpayers’ money is efficiently spent, wielding departments’ collective buying power.

Cyber defences will also be bolstered across government through cyber training and annual testing, aligning with the Government Cyber Security Strategy to protect vital public services and sensitive data from malicious attacks.

To monitor progress, specific department-level digital and data targets will be drawn up and overseen by a forum of permanent secretaries.

Paul Willmott, Chair of the Central Digital and Data Office in the Cabinet Office, said:

This strategy represents a new era of cross-governmental collaboration on digital transformation and puts the public’s experience at the heart of online services.

Investing in the Civil Service workforce through high-quality training will enable government to improve its decision-making, while driving up digital standards and adoption across the board.

Cryptoassets – commonly known as ‘crypto’ – are a relatively new, diverse and constantly evolving class of assets that have a range of potential benefits, as well as posing risks to the consumer.

As is common in emerging technology markets, the crypto sector continues to experience high levels of volatility and a number of recent failures have exposed the structural vulnerability of some business models in the sector.

Our robust approach to regulation mitigates the most significant risks, while harnessing the advantages of crypto technologies. This enables a new and exciting sector to safely flourish and grow, boosting jobs and investment.

Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Andrew Griffith said:

“We remain steadfast in our commitment to grow the economy and enable technological change and innovation – and this includes cryptoasset technology.

“But we must also protect consumers who are embracing this new technology - ensuring robust, transparent, and fair standards.”

Under plans set out by the government today (1 February), it will seek to regulate a broad suite of cryptoasset activities, consistent with its approach to traditional finance.

These proposals will place responsibility on crypto trading venues for defining the detailed content requirements for admission and disclosure documents – ensuring crypto exchanges have fair and robust standards.

The proposals will also strengthen the rules around financial intermediaries and custodians – which have responsibility for facilitating transactions and safely storing customer assets. These steps will help to deliver a robust world-first regime strengthening rules around the lending of cryptoassets, whilst enhancing consumer protection and the operational resilience of firms. As part of this approach, the consultation will seek views on improving market integrity and consumer protection by setting out a proposed crypto market abuse regime.

In addition, to address industry concerns about the small number of Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) authorised cryptoasset firms who can issue their own promotions, HM Treasury is also introducing a time limited exemption. Cryptoasset businesses that are registered with theFCAfor anti-money laundering purposes will be allowed to issue their own promotions, while the broader cryptoasset regulatory regime is being introduced.

This approach delivers on the original policy intention of the measure to promote innovation, enhance consumer protection and ensure that cryptoasset promotions can be held to equivalent standards as promotions of financial services products with similar risk profiles.

It comes as part of the government’s Spending Review, which will see working people across Scotland benefit from significant investment in clean energy and innovation, creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and strengthening Scotland’s position as the home of the United Kingdom’s clean energy revolution.

After years of delay under previous governments, the government has backed UK carbon capture industries with £9.4 billion following the Spending Review, investing in Britain’s reindustrialisation with good, well-paid, skilled jobs for Britain’s engineers, technicians and electricians.

Funding will be invested this parliament to get spades in the ground and accelerate Britain’s global leadership in the technology of the future.

It will also progress the Acorn project in Aberdeenshire and the Viking project in the Humber with development funding, helping provide long-term industrial certainty for working people at the heart of these communities.

Today the government is meeting in full the request for development funding of around £200 million, subject to business case,  to prepare the Acorn project for delivery – the first time a government has provided funding of this scale for the projects to proceed.

As the project develops, funding will also provide financial cover for the National Gas SCO₂T Connect project, to repurpose an existing 175 mile gas pipeline, alongside 35 miles of new build pipeline, to allowCO2captured at Grangemouth to be transported to storage facilities under the North Sea. Industry expects at their peak construction Acorn to support approximately 15,000 jobs and Viking to support 20,000 jobs, including 1,000 apprenticeships – bolstering the proud energy history of 2 industrial heartlands as engines for growth through the Plan for Change.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

This government is putting its money where its mouth is and backing the trailblazing Acorn and VikingCCSprojects.

This will support industrial renewal in Scotland and the Humber with thousands of highly-skilled jobs at good wages to build Britain’s clean energy future.

Carbon capture will make working people in Britain’s hard-working communities better off, breathing new life into their towns and cities and reindustrialising the country through our Plan for Change.

Tim Stedman,CEOStoregga, lead developer of Acorn, said:

We warmly welcome the UK government’s support for the Acorn project and the commitment to development funding that will enable the critical work needed to reach Final Investment Decision (FID).

Building on the momentum from the Track 1 projects and significant private sector investment, this milestone is key not only for Acorn but for establishing Scotland’s essentialCCSinfrastructure needed to grow and scale the UK’s wider carbon capture and storage industry.

We look forward to working with government in the months ahead to understand the details of today’s commitment, and to ensure the policy, regulatory and funding frameworks are in place to build and grow a world-leading UKCCSsector.

Graeme Davies, Executive Vice President,CCS, Harbour Energy said:

The Spending Review today sends a strong signal that Track-2 and VikingCCSare an infrastructure-led economic growth priority in this Parliament.

We will work with government on the critical steps needed to progress VikingCCStowards a final investment decision, following our completion of Front-End Engineering Design and approval of the onshore pipeline Development Consent Order earlier this year.

Acorn has said its project will safeguard around 18,000 jobs in the North Sea that would otherwise have been lost, including jobs at Grangemouth.

These jobs will be needed to build pipelines to transportCO2safely and generate low-carbon power to homes and businesses so the British people can have energy security, lower bills and protection from the climate crisis.

The funding accelerates the mission to become a clean energy superpower, with projects set to removeCO2emissions before they reach the atmosphere and store them away safely, which is crucial to securing Britain’s industrial manufacturing future and tackling the climate crisis. Funding builds on and provides more construction support for 2 more advanced projects in Liverpool Bay and Teesside, which both reached financial close earlier this year.

Today’s funding sets a path to unlocking billions of private sector investment, putting more money into the pockets of hard-working communities in Aberdeen and the Humber – securing their place as a world-leader of net zero and low-carbon industries.

Once Acorn and Viking are operational, combined, they could remove up to 18 million tonnes ofCO2from the atmosphere per year. As well as capturing emissions, carbon capture can also be used to generate low-carbon power, as well as enabling hydrogen power -  with the industry expected to support up to 50,000 jobs in the 2030s.

Both projects will now move forward with their proposals with the aim of reaching financial closure later this Parliament, subject to project readiness and affordability.

Today’s funding delivers on our commitments, having already reached financial investment decisions on 2 projects in Hynet, North Wales and the East Coast Cluster, Teesside which industry expects to deliver 20,000 jobs each at peak construction and assuming full deployment.

Jobs figures were provided to government by industry.

Jon Butterworth,CEO, National Gas, said

We warmly welcome the government’s decision to fund a further programme of significant carbon capture projects across the country. As Britain’s national gas network, we share the government’s view on the importance of energy security in bolstering our national security.

National Gas’s SCO₂T Connect Project, an essential component of the Acorn Project and wider Scottish Cluster, will be the key enabler for carbon capture across Scotland by providing the network infrastructure to facilitate industrial decarbonisation at scale and Clean Power.

This milestone investment commitment will set the UK on a path to be a genuine world-leader in carbon capture and storage which will play a pivotal role in securing Britain’s energy, decarbonising our economy and creating the jobs of the future.

Finlay McCutcheon, Managing Director, SSE Thermal, said:

The UK government’s support for the Scottish Cluster reflects a strong commitment to advancing a low carbon future for Scotland and the wider UK.

Peterhead Carbon Capture Power Station is an essential anchor project within the cluster, and this welcome announcement moves us a step closer to delivering this vital project.

Carbon capture technology is essential to achieving the UK’s Clean Power targets, and today’s news highlights the need to deliver clean, low carbon dispatchable power that strengthens energy security in a renewables-led system.

SSE’s Peterhead site is strategically located near North Sea oil and gas infrastructure, which we aim to repurpose forCCSin collaboration with partners Equinor and Acorn. This would create a pathway for job creation and retention in North East Scotland, while accelerating the wider decarbonisation of our industrial clusters.

This marks an important step forward for the future of UK energy infrastructure, and SSE remains committed to working closely with government and industry partners to support the transition to a clean energy future.

Olivia Powis,CEO, Carbon Capture and Storage Association (CCSA), said:

TheCCSAwelcomes support forCCUSin the Comprehensive Spending Review, with allocation of funding for the build-out of HyNet and the East Coast Cluster and development funding to progress the Acorn Project and VikingCCS.

The commitment to taking Final Investment Decision this Parliament, subject to readiness and affordability, for these clusters is welcome and helps towards giving industry the confidence it needs to move forward with major investments in low-carbon infrastructure.

This is a clear step forward to progressing the next clusters in Scotland and Humber.CCUSis critical to decarbonising our industrial heartlands, supporting clean power and enabling low-carbon hydrogen.

It also plays a key role in protecting and creating thousands of high-quality jobs across the country in critical industries like cement, chemicals and refining, and the power system — all of which are essential for meeting the government’s commitments on new infrastructure and housebuilding.

David Whitehouse,CEO, Offshore Energies UK (OEUK), said:

The support for the next phase of carbon storage projects in Scotland and Humberside is welcome, and an important step towards final investment decisions later in this Parliament. Together Viking and Acorn have the potential to unlock over £25 billion of investment by 2035, creating over 30,000 jobs at peak construction,

These projects will provide the pathway to support the decarbonisation of UK industries and are critical to the governments clean power objectives. We will continue to work with government to detail long-term support required to deliver these projects and unlock the wider UK’sCCSambition.

Sue Ferns, Senior Deputy General Secretary of Prospect union, said:

Prospect has been calling for further investment in infrastructure andCCUS, particularly in the Acorn and Viking clusters, so this is welcome.

New investment is vital to support jobs and the development of new technology in Scotland, the Humber and other industrial heartlands.

If these projects are successful they can not only help us to hit our emissions targets but will also play an important role in a just transition in the North Sea.

Dr Liz CameronCBE,CEO, Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said:

The government’s backing for the Acorn Project is a significant endorsement which will help to make the North East a world leader in the low-carbon industry.

This major carbon capture and storage facility puts us on an ecologically more sustainable trajectory and will bolster the region’s economy by creating up to 15,000 jobs in construction and attracting billions in private investment.

Whilst this intervention is undoubtedly welcome, we urge both the UK and Scottish governments to work in collaboration to realise Acorn’s potential in full.

Andy Prendergast, GMB National Secretary, said:

We strongly welcome this announcement that secures thousands of jobs whilst putting Britain’s firmly on the path to net zero. After years of dithering, it’s great to see a government willing to come forward with the investments necessary to protect and decarbonise crucial industries in Aberdeen and Humberside.

Jorge Pikunic,CEO, VPI, said:

We’re delighted that the government has backed the VikingCCScluster. It’s a pivotal step in establishingCCSas a significant and self-sustaining new industry for the UK, which can deliver tens of billions in private investment.

This will futureproof our industrial heartlands, protect the jobs and communities that depend on them, and create new skills in a sector where the UK can play a leading role globally.

At a time when the government is looking to deliver clean power and economic growth, precious few projects offer both opportunities. Our anchor project in Immingham is one of them; having completed the engineering design as one of the first proposed emitter projects for VikingCCS.

We look forward to seeing further details and working together on the next steps.","Funding for carbon capture projects (Acorn, Viking, HyNet, East Coast Cluster)",Monetary,Other,id25_271

The recommendations include:

Whilst the bulk-buying of tickets ahead of real fans by professional resellers – who then sell them at inflated prices – may be illegal, swift and effective action by authorities is not possible under the current law. Similar issues arise in relation to laws which prevent resellers advertising tickets using incorrect information, or ‘speculatively selling’ tickets that they don’t own.

Over recent years the CMA has taken strong action against secondary ticketing websites to tackle non-compliance in the sector, including the failure to provide important and accurate information to consumers. This has included requiring viagogo and StubHub to remove misleading messaging about ticket availability and to tell customers where the tickets they buy might lead to them being turned away at the door.

George Lusty, Senior Director for Consumer Protection at the CMA, said:

“Over recent years we have taken strong action to protect people buying tickets from resellers online, and the secondary ticket websites are now worlds apart from those we saw before the CMA took action.

“While it is clear that concerns about the sector remain, there are limits to what the CMA and other enforcers can do with their current powers. With live music and sporting events starting back up we want the Government to take action to strengthen the current laws and introduce a licensing regime for secondary ticketing platforms.

“If adopted, these proposals will help prevent people getting ripped off by unscrupulous resellers online and we stand ready to help the Government to implement them.”

The fish pass has opened up the River Trent and its tributaries for coarse and migratory fish, including salmon and trout, as well as eels

The Environment Agency’s £12m flagship project in the Colwick Country Park has been officially opened today (Friday 8 November) by Chair of the Environment Agency, Alan Lovell.

It opens up the River Trent and its tributaries for migratory fish, including salmon, trout and eels, making more habitat accessible for fish.

After two years in construction the Colwick (Holme Sluices) fish pass was completed earlier this year. Fish are now able to reach their spawning and feeding grounds.

Steve Lawrie, Area Environment Manager at the Environment Agency said:

We have held the official opening of this major project with our partner Nottingham City Council, at the site of the fish pass in the council’s Colwick Country Park.

The fish pass provides a significant step in restoring the River Trent catchment to its former glory for salmon and other coarse and migratory fish.  It also includes an eel pass to help support the critically endangered European eel.

We also have a public viewing platform above the water, with highly visual interpretation boards. They inform and advise visitors about the local wildlife in and around the river, including the fish that are expected to use the pass.

Credit: Jackson Civil Engineering

The Colwick fish pass has been completed as part of the Environment Agency’s work to improve fish passage across the country. It is 200 metres long, 6 metres deep and 6.5 metres wide.

Fish can now navigate past the Environment Agency-owned Holme Sluices that were built in the 1950s.  It forms part of a large-scale flood defence scheme and helps to protect Nottingham from flooding.

The fish pass includes a 2-metre-high fully automated radial gate which constantly monitors the water levels and flow rates in the River Trent. The pass will then open and close based on the differing water levels throughout the year.

The pass is divided into 20 ascending chambers into which water flows through narrow slots. Fish of all species can swim upstream to lay their eggs in the gravel riverbeds of the Trent tributaries such as the River Dove and the River Derwent.  They will be able to pass through these slots and rest in the chamber above before continuing.

The direct environmental benefits of the fish pass will be £18.6m. This includes 60 kilometres of river improvement from poor to good status for fish, as well as 60 kilometres of new spawning habitat immediately upstream of the barrier. It will also aid interconnectivity with numerous other fish passage schemes previously constructed upstream by the Environment Agency.

The decline of migratory fish in the Trent catchment dates back to the Industrial Revolution, when large weirs were built to open up the river for trade. While some fish were able to overcome these barriers not all of them could.

The UK’s cyber security industry is valued at £11.9 billion and helps protect growth in the UK. Cyber skills are in huge demand across the economy and the 2024 Cyber security skills in the UK labour market survey found that 44% of UK businesses do not have the fundamental skills to protect themselves from cyber-attacks.

James Lyne, Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer at SANS said:

SANS Institute is delighted to collaborate withDSITon the UK Cyber Team Competition, a critical initiative addressing the growing cyber security skills shortage. We are a firm believer in uncapping the next generation of cybersecurity professionals in the 18-25 year old bracket.

By immersing young talent in real-world cyber scenarios and providing direct mentorship from industry leaders, we are not only cultivating the next generation of highly skilled professionals but also reinforcing the nation’s cyber defence capabilities. These types of competitions are essential in showcasing the UK’s cybersecurity strength, bolstering national defence, and in the spirit of friendly competition with other nations we in turn build international relationships.

These competitions also drive growth in the cybersecurity sector by providing a platform for talent recruitment and skills development, while ensuring that participants are equipped with the expertise needed to help defend organisations. We also hope that this initiative will contribute to the long-term resilience of the UK’s digital landscape and broader security objectives by fostering a diverse pipeline of well-trained professionals.

Sheridan AshMBEand Dr Claire Thorne, co-CEOsof Tech She Can said:

This is a fantastic opportunity to highlight the wide range of often overlooked roles in cybersecurity throughout the UK, while connecting a wealth of untapped technology talent with real-world industry experiences and job prospects.

The diversity and technology skills gaps are both real and urgent challenges. Through our work in classrooms across the country, we’ve seen how aligning young people’s passions—like gaming and eSports—with technology careers can engage both boys and girls effectively. We’re particularly excited about the doors this will open for young women, who are already playing, and will continue to play, a critical role in safeguarding our future.

Katie GallagherOBE, co-founder of the North West Cyber Resilience Centre said:

We welcome this excellent initiative fromDSITto inspire young people to explore careers in cyber security. As the recent government survey found 44% of businesses have skills gaps in basic technical areas - and 30% of cyber firms in 2024 have faced a problem with technical skills gaps.

However, with the growth of cyber breaches and hacking, it is vital that we work together as a community to grow the cyber security talent pathway.

Officials on Monday held a series of meetings with organisations who represent the haulage industry and handle a significant portion of the UK’s cross border trade, to confirm that from 29 March, the status quo will be temporarily maintained as they will not need to submit Entry Summary Declarations on imports for a period of six months.

Currently Entry Summary Declarations are not required when importing goods from the EU. They will continue to apply for trade from the rest of the world.

The measure is designed to give business more time to prepare for changes to EU-UK trade arrangements in the event that the UK leaves without a deal. This builds on the plans that Transitional Simplified Procedures (TSP) can be used for at least 15 months for customs declarations.

Financial Secretary to the Treasury Mel Stride MP said:

We’ve listened to businesses and are responding to their concerns.

We have been adamant that in the event of no deal, trade must continue at our borders, and we will continue to make our borders secure.

Maintaining continuity with the current system for the first six months and phasing Entry Summary Declarations in will ensure we deliver on that promise.

The new rules only apply to goods coming from the EU, and will maintain the status quo for carriers. Importers will still be required to submit import declarations for customs purposes – which are not the same as Entry Summary Declarations. HMRC announced ways of making these import declarations easier, through Transitional Simplified Procedures on 4 February 2019.

After the six-month transitional period, carriers will be legally responsible for ensuring Entry Summary Declarations are submitted pre-arrival to HMRC at the time specified by mode of transport.

The measure will not change the UK’s commitment to ensuring our borders remain secure in the event of a no deal and Border Force will continue to carry out intelligence-led checks. A Readiness Task Force in preparation for EU Exit is being recruited and Border Force is on track to increase staff headcount by 900 at the end of March 2019.

The UK’s approach to dangerous goods coming into the UK is not affected.

The Mutual Recognition Agreement on Conformity Assessment (MRA) was signed by Her Majesty’s Ambassador Sir Kim Darroch and Deputy United States Trade Representative C.J. Mahoney in Washington today (Thursday 14 February).

The agreement will maintain all relevant aspects of the current EU-US MRA when the EU-US agreement ceases to apply to the UK. It helps facilitate goods trade between the two nations and means UK exporters can continue to ensure goods are compliant with technical regulations before they depart the UK, saving businesses time, money and resources. American exporters to the UK benefit in the same way.

Total UK-US trade in sectors covered by the deal is worth up to £12.8 billion, based on recent average trade flows. Of this, the UK exports covered are worth an estimated £8.9 billion- more than a fifth of total UK goods exports to the US. Today’s signing marks a crucial step in the important trading relationship between the UK and America, the world’s largest economy.

The agreement benefits a range of sectors, including pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceuticals account for around £7.7 billion of UK exports to the US - nearly 18% of total UK goods exports to the US. Other industries that will benefit include the tech sector and telecommunications equipment suppliers.

Similar agreements have been signed in recent weeks with Australia and New Zealand, ensuring continuity and safeguarding revenues for British businesses and consumers.

International Trade Secretary, Dr Liam Fox said:

The UK and the US are the strongest of trading partners and this agreement will allow British and American businesses to keep trading as freely as they do today, without additional bureaucracy.

Our top priority is ensuring continuity for businesses as we leave the European Union and we are signing other agreements in the days and weeks ahead. We look forward to sitting down at the negotiating table with the Americans after we leave the European Union to strike an ambitious new free trade agreement.

This agreement has been welcomed by techUK, who represent more than 900 companies and around 700,000 employees in the UK tech sector.

CEO of techUK, Julian David, said:

This is a positive step to enable trade continuity with the biggest tech market in the world. Manufacturers value the current agreement so it is very good news that they won’t now have to seek costly alternative arrangements to get approval for products used in high-end manufacturing, smart electronics and consumer devices.

Ensuring stability in this type of agreement is a strong starting point for the UK as we develop trade links with the USA as part of the Government’s support for a new and proactive trade agenda.

Dr Richard Torbett, Executive Director of Commercial Policy: UK and International, at The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said:

Finalising this MRA provides UK pharmaceutical companies with business continuity by streamlining regulatory processes between the UK and USA post Brexit.

The US is already our largest trading partner outside the EU. Trade between the two countries was worth £184 billion in the year ending Q3 2018 (ONS). The US is also the single biggest source of inward investment into the UK.

The UK is prioritising a new Free Trade Agreement with the US after we leave the EU, and we will publish our response to the public consultations about our negotiation approach shortly.

The UK and US have also signed a Mutual Recognition Agreement on Marine Equipment (MRA) today. This will provide continuity of the effect of the EU-US Marine Equipment MRA when the EU-US agreement ceases to apply to the UK. This means that marine equipment manufacturers will continue only to need certification in one jurisdiction before being able to legally place their equipment on both markets and on board both UK and US flagged vessels.",Mutual Recognition Agreement on Conformity Assessment (MRA) and Mutual Recognition Agreement on Marine Equipment (MRA),Administrative,Other,id25_277

This Bill does three specific things.

First, it ends the system of male preference primogeniture. So, in the royal succession, older sisters will no longer be overtaken by their younger brothers.

Second, it removes the law which says that anyone who marries a Roman Catholic automatically loses their place in the line. A legal barrier that applies to Catholics and only Catholics - no other faith.

Third, it replaces the 1772 Royal Marriages Act. Under that Act, any descendent of George II must seek the reigning monarch’s consent before marrying - without which their marriage is void. This law - passed 240 years ago - is clearly now unworkable: George II’s descendants number in their hundreds; many will be unaware of this arcane requirement; many will have only a tenuous link to the Royal family.

So the Bill proposes that the monarch need only consent to the marriages of the first six individuals in the line of succession - without which they would lose their place.

That way we retain the tradition of monarchical consent, but, in limiting it to the people who could - feasibly - assume the throne it will be applied in a much more reasonable way.

Clearly this third reform is important for practical reasons. The other two, Mr Speaker, are more about our values.

The current rules of succession belong to a bygone era. They reflect old prejudices and old fears. Today we do not support laws which discriminate on either religious or gender grounds. They have no place in modern Britain, and certainly not in our monarchy: An institution central to our constitution, to the Commonwealth, and to our national identity too.

With the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge expecting a baby, and having just celebrated our Queen’s 60 year reign, this Bill is timely, as well as popular. It’s also straightforward and enjoys support across these benches. So altogether a rare beast in constitutional reform - and I should know.

I’ll come on to the Catholic provisions in a few moments - I’m aware some Honourable Members have concerns about their implications. But, just on female succession, I think the real question we need to ask is: why has it taken us so long?

This is a nation which prides itself on pioneering equality between the sexes. A nation of great queens: Queen Victoria, Elizabeth II. A woman can - and has - been the Head of the UK government. Yet still, on our statute books, with parliament’s official backing, we have succession laws based on the supposed superiority of men.

That anachronism is out of step with our society. It sends the wrong message to the rest of the world. It’s time for the rules to change.

That aim, I know, has support on all sides of this House. Indeed the Bill builds on the endeavours of the previous government, who helped lay the foundations for reform with the Commonwealth Realms - for whom the Queen is also the Head of State.

Drafting has been a long and careful process. And I would like to pay special tribute to Rebecca Kitteridge - New Zealand’s Cabinet Secretary - for her extraordinary work in making sure these proposals can be effected across the Commonwealth Realms.

Agreeing constitutional change for 16 states - each with its own government and legislature - is clearly a challenge. And, from the realms backing the reforms in principle in 2011 it took one year and two months to get full agreement, in writing, from everyone. In a phenomenal coincidence - one I know is hard to believe - we received the final consent just hours before the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge announced that they are expecting a baby.

The Palace has - of course - been actively involved in the process from the beginning. And both the Church of England and the Catholic Church have been kept informed throughout.

We now have a very short Bill - five clauses and a schedule. And I would urge the House to bear in mind that it must be kept narrow in order to be adopted across all 16 Commonwealth Realms.

I’ve heard the suggestion that we use the Bill to tackle the gender bias in hereditary titles. So where titles - and the benefits that come with them - leapfrog eldest daughters and are handed down to younger sons or can be lost entirely when there is no male heir.

Personally I’m very sympathetic to that reform, and I can see why this seems like the natural time to do it. But, for purely practical reasons, it cannot be done in this Bill. Nor can we use the Bill to mop up any other constitutional odds and ends. Very simply, it cannot be broadened out to include UK-specific reforms because they are not relevant to the Realms of the Commonwealth.

On the so-called ‘Catholic Question’, Mr Speaker, the Coalition Government is seeking to remove the current ban on heirs to the throne from marrying Catholics. Or, as the current legislation says, rather insultingly, from ‘marrying a papist’.

This law is a reflection of the times in which it was written. We’d seen nearly two centuries of religious strife within England, Scotland and Ireland; the threat of conflict with Louis XIV’s France and other Catholic powers; tension with Rome. An era when legal defences seemed vital against a dangerous threat from abroad.

And not just in the royal succession - in the 40 years after the Glorious Revolution a whole range of restrictions were put in place.

Catholics couldn’t vote; they were excluded from all professions and public offices; they couldn’t go to university; couldn’t teach; couldn’t be the guardian of a child; couldn’t buy land with a lease of more than 31 years; couldn’t own a horse worth more than £5.

Edmund Burke called the laws “well fitted for the oppression, impoverishment and degradation of a people as ever proceeded from the perverted ingenuity of man”.

Many were repealed relatively quickly. The ban on owning land in 1778; on voting and serving in the legal profession in 1793. By the time the ban on Catholics serving in this House as MPs, and serving as judges, was lifted in 1829, most of the main restrictions were gone.

And, years later, in November 1995, the visit by Her Majesty The Queen to Westminster Cathedral - the first time a reigning Monarch had set foot inside a Catholic Church since Queen Mary - was a watershed moment in relations between the British state and its millions of loyal, patriotic Catholic citizens.

Now it falls to us to complete this transformation, ridding ourselves of the arcane ban on Catholics marrying the monarch. This Bill does exactly that.

I know there are some concerns among some honourable members about potential unintended consequences of this reform: specifically, if a monarch is married to a Catholic and their heir has to be brought up in the Catholic faith. On becoming King or Queen they would then be unable to assume their role as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. That, in turn, would lead to the disestablishment of the state church. But if we follow that logic, we should be introducing bans on marriage to members of every other faith - and indeed people with no faith. Right now the monarch can marry a Muslim, a Jew, a Hindu, an atheist - yet no one is alleging today that we’re teetering on the edge of a constitutional crisis.

The Catholic Church does not - and has not for some time - have any blanket rule dictating all children in mixed marriages must be brought up as Catholics. Indeed, look at the current Royal Family. Prince Michael of Kent is an Anglican, his wife a Catholic, and their heirs, Lord Frederick and Lady Gabriella Windsor, are Anglican and retain their places in line to the throne.

For anyone who’s still not convinced, I suggest they read the briefing issued to MPs by the Church of England’s parliamentary unit last week. It states that: “the present prohibition on anyone remaining in the line of succession or succeeding to the Crown as a result of marrying a Roman Catholic is not necessary to support the requirement that the Sovereign join in communion with the Church of England.”

Its proposed removal is a welcome symbolic and practical measure consistent with respect for the principle of religious liberty. It reflects the sea change in ecumenical relations over recent decades.

Yes, in matters of constitutional significance we should always proceed with care. Yes, we must always think through the potential knock on effects of reform. But we also need to move with the times. Discrimination is discrimination wherever we find it. And, just as we respect our traditions and cherish our monarchy, this House must never tolerate prejudice in our laws. Equality is, after all, a great British tradition too.

And with that, Mr Speaker, I commend this Bill to the House.",Removal of the 1772 Royal Marriages Act and the prohibition on Catholic heirs marrying the monarch.,Legislative,,id25_278

Dear Frank

Thank you for your work on the Independent Review of Poverty and Life Chances. Your report will be of service not only to the Government, but to the nation. It marks a vital moment in the history of our efforts to tackle poverty and disadvantage.

We welcome your focus on the early years, or ‘Foundation Years’. These preschool years are the critical ones in terms of promoting a fairer and more mobile society. We also agree with you that inter-generational poverty needs to be given as much weight as static, income-based measures. The problem of poverty - and particularly child poverty - has to be situated in a framework based on life chances.

It is clear that we need to broaden and lengthen our concept of poverty: to look at poverty in the round, and over time.

Income is one of a wide range of factors that define and describe poverty. We need to look at people’s experience of poverty in all its dimensions, and in real life, not merely in narrow statistical terms. We therefore welcome your recommendation that we should adopt a new set of Life Chances Indicators.

As your report makes clear, we also need to focus on people trapped in poverty, sometimes over generations. Poor children are at a high risk of becoming poor adults. This violates any notion of fairness. Nobody should be condemned to poverty or constricted life chances because of the circumstances of their birth. That is why the Coalition Government has already made the promotion of intergenerational mobility the principal goal of our social policy.

The Coalition Government is keen to stimulate a national debate about the nature of poverty in the UK today and the Government’s role in tackling it. Your report represents a hugely valuable contribution to that debate. We are enormously grateful to you and your team.

Over £73 million has been awarded from Round 2 of the Advanced Manufacturing Supply Chain Initiative (AMSCI) to 12 national supply chain projects, and a further £140 million will be invested by business.

Examples of winning bids include the creation of a ‘National Aerospace Technology Exploitation Programme’ led by the Aerospace Growth Partnership to address skills shortages and improve R&D collaboration in the aerospace sector. The £35 million project will create nearly 5,000 jobs in the supply chain. Another successful bid, led by David Brown Gear Systems in Huddersfield, will position the UK as a world leader in the creation of large gearboxes for the next generation of offshore wind turbines.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said:

Boosting jobs and growth is my number one priority to build a stronger economy. This investment will secure Britain’s future as a world leader in industries like cars, where we have traditionally taken the lead, and new technologies such as wind turbine gears and semiconductor chips.

Investing in the iconic Aston Martin means that our home grown expert engineers will make the Rapide S here which is excellent news. The Regional Growth Fund is all about giving power to businesses and investing in projects that will have a long-term impact on local areas.

Following the announcement – to be made at the government’s Manufacturing Summit at the Heritage Motor Centre in Warwickshire – the Deputy Prime Minister will be joined by Business Secretary Vince Cable to tour Aston Martin in Gaydon as the company marks its centenary year.

They will see production of the new Rapide S cars and announce support of £1.6 million from Round 2 of the Regional Growth Fund to develop the project and has helped to bring manufacturing back to the UK.

The move creates 20 new jobs and protects over 70 further roles at Aston Martin’s headquarters in Gaydon as well as at the new facility in Coventry.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said:

Aston Martin is an iconic British brand, so it should be made in the UK. Otherwise it’s like having champagne from Bulgaria or a Swiss watch built in Swaziland.

As we celebrate Aston Martin’s 100th anniversary, it’s encouraging to see the company investing in new technologies and creating valuable British jobs outside of London. This is exactly the type of high-value manufacturing that we excel at here in the UK. Our Industrial Strategy, which creates a joint business plan between government and industry, will ensure that we retain and grow these types of businesses in the long term.

Dr Ulrich Bez, Aston Martin CEO said:

Aston Martin celebrated its 100th birthday in January. This celebration will continue throughout the year with events around the world, communicating the success story, the values of Aston Martin and the best of British.

The RGF backing has helped us to bring production of the new Rapide S, which will make its public debut at the Geneva Motor Show next week, back to the Midlands. We are looking forward to support from the government for our future significant investment plans, which will help to safeguard existing jobs and create more.

The third annual Manufacturing Summit brings together government and key industry leaders to discuss and debate progress, the upcoming challenges and next steps for the sector as the government continues to put manufacturing at the heart of its Growth Programme.

Offshore wind projects are crucial to delivering the UK’s mission for clean power by 2030 and to become a clean energy superpower. The UK is already home to the largest grid-connected floating offshore wind farm in the world, with a further 30GW in the pipeline, and the latest statistics showing that wind generated more power than gas last year.

The expansion of Port of Cromarty Firth will make it the first port able to make floating offshore wind turbines on site and at scale in the UK, backed by a grant from the Floating Offshore Wind Manufacturing Investment Scheme (FLOWMIS).

This initial financial backing from the UK government paves the way for the port to secure match-funding from other investors, with the port expected to become operational by the start of 2028.

Construction work on the port’s expansion is expected to create up to 320 jobs. When fully developed, the port is expected to support up to 1,000 skilled jobs in the construction, installation and operational support of offshore and floating offshore wind - such as crane operators, marine engineers, and people working on the vessels towing the turbines out to sea.

Energy Minister Michael Shanks said:

Communities in Scotland and across the country should be powered by reliable, home-grown, clean energy from British coastlines – this is how we reduce our reliance on unstable fossil fuel markets and bring down energy bills for good.

That’s why the government is getting on with building the infrastructure needed to roll out clean energy quickly, creating skilled jobs in local communities and driving growth – the priority in our Plan for Change.

The UK is already a world leader in floating offshore wind, but this support for Cromarty Firth will take us even further – creating hundreds of jobs in Scotland and delivering energy security for the UK.

Scottish Secretary, Ian Murray, said:

Scotland is a key part of making the UK a global leader in clean energy and this investment is a significant vote of confidence in the Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport and the surrounding area.

Through our Plan for Change the UK government is paving the way for cutting-edge floating offshore wind technology while also helping to create highly skilled jobs and drive economic growth.

Alex Campbell, Port of Cromarty Firth Chief Executive, said:

The Port is delighted thatFLOWMISfunding has been secured for our ambitious Phase 5 expansion, which is a critical step towards creating the UK’s first custom-built floating offshore wind integration port.

We believe this confirmation by the UK government shows the faith in our Trust Port status to deliver jobs and economic growth locally and nationally, and that the certainty from this announcement will unlock further investment in other Ports across the Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport to boost their complementary plans.

The £55.7 million grant award is the latest step taken by the government to deliver clean power by 2030 and support growth. The government also launched theClean Industry Bonus, incentivising offshore wind developers to invest in cleaner supply chains and create jobs in industrial communities.

FLOWMISwas launched in 2023, designed to provide grants to ports to support development of port infrastructure needed for deployment of floating offshore wind at scale. The Port of Cromarty Firth is one of two ports selected for funding, with plans for the second shortlisted port, Port Talbot, under development.

Many EU laws kept on after Brexit were agreed as part of a complex compromise between 28 different EU member states and were simply duplicated into the UK’s statute books, often not considering the UK’s own priorities or objectives.

The Brexit Freedoms Bill will enable the UK government to remove years of burdensome EU regulation in favour of a more agile, home-grown regulatory approach that benefits people and businesses across the UK. By removing these legal restraints and replacing them with what works for the UK, our businesses and economy can innovate and grow to new levels.

As a result of the bill, around £1 billion worth of red tape will be removed, giving businesses the confidence to invest and create jobs, while transforming the UK into one of the best regulated economies in the world.

The Bill is an integral step in the Prime Minister’s mission to unlock growth and will support Britain’s most entrepreneurial businesses to capitalise on the UK’s global leadership in areas like clean energy technologies, life sciences and digital services. This in turn will help to spur real-life benefits and increased living standards for the British public - from advanced healthcare treatments and faster infrastructure projects to increased environmental standards such as cleaner air.

Business Secretary, Jacob Rees Mogg said:

Now that the UK has regained its independence, we have a fantastic opportunity to do away with outdated and burdensome EU laws, and to bring forward our own regulations that are tailor-made to our country’s needs.

The Brexit Freedoms Bill will remove needless bureaucracy that prevents businesses from investing and innovating in the UK, cementing our position as a world class place to start and grow a business.

By giving the government new secondary powers to amend, replace or repeal any retained EU law, the amount of parliamentary time that is required has been dramatically reduced. They will also make it easier for departments to create agile regulation that keeps pace with technological change.

The Bill will end the special status retained EU law has on the UK statute books by 2023, meaning domestic law will be reinstated as the highest form of law on the UK’s statute book again. The most burdensome and outdated EU laws can then be amended, repealed, or replaced.

Consistent with the government’s approach to Brexit policy, the Bill will apply to the entirety of the UK, enabling joint working between the UK government and devolved administrations, and ensuring everyone can access the benefits of Brexit to stimulate economic growth, innovation, and job creation across the Union.

The government has engaged, and will continue to work, with a range of organisations and stakeholders to ensure the best possible outcome when reforming retained EU law. This ensures the UK’s high standards in areas such as workers’ rights and the environment are kept, also giving the UK the opportunity to be bolder and go further than the EU in these areas.

The Bill will maintain all commitments to the international obligations required of the UK. The Bill’s introduction will build on the significant progress the government has made since delivering Brexit on 31 January 2020, which include:",Brexit Freedoms Bill,Legislative,,id25_285

The plan sets out the government’s role in supporting local areas to tackle the hatred that divides communities and ruins the lives of victims, often with tragic consequences. It also highlights a drive to encourage more victims to come forward and report incidents, which will provide the government and agencies with a clearer understanding of the problem so that further support can be targeted where it is most needed.

The plan outlines a cross-government approach to tackling hate crime focusing on three key themes:

Lynne Featherstone said:

‘Hate crime has devastating consequences for victims and their families, and also divides communities. We must all stand up and confront this despicable behaviour. Hate crime is unacceptable in a civilised society and we owe it to victims and their families to carry on the fight against hatred.’

The plan covers a range of issues from tackling school bullying, challenging negative stereotypes and addressing racial, religious, disability, homophobic and transgender hate crimes. It also covers improving data, sharing good practice among local areas and issuing new guidance for police officers.

ACPO lead for hate crime, assistant chief constable Drew Harris, said:

‘Hate crime causes a great deal of harm and fear among victims and communities and it has no place in a modern society. The UK is among world leaders in the way that it responds to hate crime, but there is still much work to do.

‘One of our greatest challenges is to reduce the under-reporting of hate crime and this action plan builds on the work achieved to increase the confidence of victims and witnesses to come forward.’

Race equalities minister Andrew Stunell said:

‘A high commitment to tolerance is one of the most respected values in this country. But for too many people these values are not reflected in their daily experience.

‘We are working towards a fully integrated society in which everyone feels able to take part and this government is committed to ensuring that everyone has the freedom to live free from hostility or harassment.

‘Hate crime in any form cannot be tolerated and we will remain vigilant to the continuing challenges and support the police in taking firm action against those who promote prejudice and seek to divide our communities.’

The Independent Family Returns Panel makes recommendations to the UK Border Agency on the best method of returning individual families to their home country, ensuring the specific welfare needs of children are met.

Following an open recruitment process, Immigration Minister Damian Green has appointed 11 panel members including the chair, Chris Spencer, a former Director of Education and Children’s Services in the London Borough of Hillingdon.

Other panel members include former directors of local authority children’s services departments, members of Local Safeguarding Children Boards, a former head teacher and doctors who will be able to provide professional medical advice.

Damian Green said:

‘Our more humane approach to family returns places the welfare of children at the heart of the process and the Independent Family Returns Panel has a vital role to play.

‘These appointments mean that our decisions will continue to be guided by a group which boasts an exceptional level of expertise, experience and dedication to the welfare of children.

‘We always take a compassionate approach in this sensitive area of our work but individuals with no legal right to be in the UK must return home.’

The appointments announced today mean that the panel now exists in its full form, having operated on an interim basis since March 2011.

Mr Green also announced today that representatives of the UK Border Agency and Department for Education who sat on the panel as interim members during its initial phase are to withdraw from full panel membership. UK Border Agency officials will continue to support the panel, providing operational information and answering the questions of panel members.

Chair Chris Spencer said:

‘Once the decision has been taken that a family has no right to remain in the UK it is important that the plan to remove them reflects the children’s best interests and considers carefully any safeguarding issues.

‘I am pleased that independent members appointed to the panel bring with them years of experience from across the children’s landscape including the police, local authorities, health services and the third sector which will ensure that this happens.’



Minister of State for Children and Families Sarah Teather said:

‘The reforms to the immigration system for children and families have been about putting compassion and children’s welfare at its heart.

‘The appointment of members to the full panel contributes to that by ensuring that there is independent expertise on how best to manage returns of individual families.’

The panel is one part of a wider process designed to ensure families with no right to remain in the UK are returned to their home countries with dignity, ensuring the welfare of children at all times.

The new approach emphasises close engagement with families and provides a range of structured opportunities for them to take up assisted return or leave of their own volition, to make further representations or seek further legal redress.

1. The government committed to the ending of child detention for immigration purposes. In December 2010, it unveiled a new compassionate approach to family removals, following a wide-reaching review and consultation led by the UK Border Agency in partnership with the Department for Education.

288,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/billions-of-investment-for-british-manufacturing-to-boost-economic-growth,News story,Billions of investment for British manufacturing to boost economic growth,"The government has today announced £4.5 billion in funding for British manufacturing to increase investment in eight sectors across the UK. The funding will be available from 2025 for five years, providing industry with longer term certainty about their investments.",HM Treasury,17 November 2023,"Over £2 billion has been earmarked for the automotive industry and £975 million for aerospace, supporting the manufacturing, supply chain and development of zero emission vehicles, and investment in energy efficient and zero-carbon aircraft equipment.

Alongside this, the government has committed to £960 million for a Green Industries Growth Accelerator to support clean energy manufacturing, and £520 million for life sciences manufacturing to build resilience for future health emergencies and capitalise on the UK’s world-leading research and development.

With the entire manufacturing sector making up over 43% of all UK exports and employing around 2.6 million people, this funding is targeted at the UK’s strongest, world leading sectors; including where the industry is undergoing fundamental changes to remain at the forefront of the global transition to net zero, like the move to zero emission vehicles in the automotive industry.

The Green Industries Growth Accelerator investment will support the expansion of strong, home-grown, clean energy supply chains across the UK, including carbon capture, utilisation and storage, electricity networks, hydrogen, nuclear and offshore wind. This will enable the UK to seize growth opportunities through the transition to net zero, building on our world-leading decarbonisation track record and strong deployment offer.

The funding forms part of the Prime Minister’s pledge to grow the economy, and his focus on making decisions for the long-term, ensuring this funding doesn’t just focus on the most successful sectors today but looks ahead to how we keep pace internationally and build the UK’s expertise for the industries of the future.

Together with our existing manufacturing support and plans for net zero transition, this package will help unlock private investment, provide certainty to investors, boost energy security, and protect and create jobs. This approach has already mobilised £198 billion in public and private investment in low carbon energy deployment since 2010.

Today’s announcement comes ahead of the second Global Investment Summit later this month, which will showcase innovative companies from across the UK, with significant investment opportunities in sectors such as technology, sustainability, life sciences, advanced manufacturing, and creative industries.

It will also help ensure that the UK remains at the forefront of the global transition to net zero and can seize growth opportunities in the new green economy. The UK remains a world-leader in cutting emissions, having decarbonised faster than any G7 country since 1990 and set out clear plans to meet all our climate targets and deliver energy security.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, said:

“Britain is now the 8th largest manufacturer in the world, recently overtaking France. To build on this success, we are targeting funding to support the sectors where the UK is or could be world-leading.

“Our £4.5 billion of funding will leverage many times that from the private sector, and in turn will grow our economy, creating more skilled, higher-paid jobs in new industries that will be built to last.”

Business and Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch said:

“The UK is a global hub for advanced manufacturing, with world-leading automotive, aerospace and maritime sectors. This package builds on recent investment wins, such as the £4 billion gigafactory, and the £600m invested to build the next generation of electric Minis, and ensures that the government can continue to help create jobs, grow the economy, and secure the future of great British manufacturing.”

Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary Claire Coutinho said:

“Today we are announcing nearly £1bn to back our green industries. While we’ve already attracted £200 billion in low carbon investment since 2010, with another £100 billion expected by 2030, this will unlock even more. We have long been energy pioneers in advanced manufacturing, and this will allow us to carry on that great British tradition.”

Today, the government has also published its response to Professor Dame Angela McLean’s review of the role that regulation and standards can play in driving innovation and growth in advanced manufacturing.

The government accepts all 14 recommendations in the industry expert-backed report which builds on the UK’s role as a global leader in setting industrial standards and sets out how, with the right regulations, advanced manufacturing processes can enhance safety and support the drive to net zero and a more sustainable economy.

Among the recommendations accepted is to accelerate the deployment of digital twins, which enables companies to create accurate digital replicas of the full manufacturing process. Used across a range of sectors, digital twins have seen significant uptake in the automotive sector including car production where they offer a transformative approach to product development, manufacturing and maintenance, helping firms test how to fix problems or make processes more efficient.

To boost growth in small and medium sized manufacturing businesses more widely, it has also been announced today that the government will expand the Made Smarter Adoption programme, offering the scheme to all English regions in 2025-26 before working with the Devolved Administrations to explore making the programme UK-wide from 2026-27.

The programme helps small and medium sized manufacturing companies to use advanced digital technologies which can reduce carbon emissions and drive-up productivity, and its expansion will also involve inclusion of digital internships.

Stephen Phipson, CEO of Make UK, the manufacturers’ organisation said:

“Make UK has long campaigned for Made Smarter to be a fully national scheme so that all SME manufacturers can benefit from the expertise the programme delivers and we are delighted at today’s decision from government to commit to a national rollout.

“Made Smarter has already transformed thousands of companies in the North East, North West, West Midlands and Yorkshire & the Humber and now it can help turbo-charge industrial digitalisation in SMEs across the whole of the country. The end-to-end specialist support the programme delivers has successfully helped smaller businesses dramatically boost productivity, improve energy efficiency, drive growth, upskill roles and deliver new jobs in digital skills to create workforces of the future which will allow Britain’s smaller manufacturers to continue to grow and remain globally competitive.”

Additionally, the government has today committed to extend the Connected and Automated Mobility Research and Development programme with up to £150 million of funding between 2025-26 and 2029-30. This will help the UK secure first-mover advantage in the deployment of self-driving vehicles and services.

The UK’s first Battery Strategy is also expected to be published next week, which will outline the Government’s activity to achieve a globally competitive battery supply chain in the UK by 2030 that supports economic prosperity and the Net Zero transition.

We have also set out our plan to launch a Hydrogen industry taskforce, delivered in partnership with the Hydrogen Innovation Initiative and Innovate UK, supporting our ambition to maximise investment opportunities for UK manufacturing of hydrogen propulsion systems.

The government will set out more about its offer to the manufacturing sector next week with the publication of the Advanced Manufacturing Plan.

Some 67 WTO members, including both developed and developing countries, have delivered an agreement on Services Domestic Regulation which cuts red tape around licensing and qualifications and is set to reduce services trade costs by up to 7% annually.

The UK has been a strong and vocal participant throughout negotiations since they were launched at the 11th Ministerial Conference in Buenos Aires in 2017, particularly after formally taking up our independent seat at the WTO last year. As the world’s second-largest services exporter, the UK is among the countries positioned to benefit the most from its terms.

British businesses consistently cite complex administrative procedures as barriers to accessing international markets. The new rules will make it easier for businesses of all sizes – particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – to navigate foreign markets and obtain authorisation to export overseas.

Once the new rules are in force, businesses can expect licensing applications to be processed in a timely manner, acceptance of electronic copies of qualifications by competent authorities, and an end to unreasonable and hidden fees.

The UK will be among a handful of nations applying the new rules across the broadest possible range of services sectors, including financial services. The biggest savings are likely to be in finance and tech – helping ensure London retains its position as Europe’s leading financial centre.

“We are delighted to have played our part in bringing about this historic deal, which shows exactly the kind of cooperation we want to see at the WTO and demonstrates it can deliver trade rules fit for the 21st century.

“As the world’s second largest services exporter, the UK is particularly aware of how important it is to cut red tape and get trade flowing to build back better from the pandemic.”

“This agreement will be celebrated by the UK’s financial and related professional services industry. It is an essential step towards removing the types of trade barriers most often experienced by services exporters.

“This necessary and innovative agreement will reduce costs for UK businesses, support women’s economic empowerment, and is a significant win for the WTO and wider multilateral economic cooperation.”

“Sixty-seven WTO members coming together to agree on an outcome which delivers Services Domestic Regulation is a meaningful achievement that has real commercial value for services providers all around the world.

“Services Domestic Regulation brings increased predictability and transparency to the technical standards, licensing and qualification requirements and procedures that affect services providers every single day when they work internationally.”

“We are delighted to see the approval of rules on domestic regulation. This sends a strong signal about the continuous relevance and importance of multilateral rules for services providers in an increasingly globalised world.

“We believe that rules on domestic regulation will set common principles for enacting laws on the provision of services, which will help create more transparency.

“For the legal sector, this will mean greater predictability and information about the applicable regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions. This, in turn, will help reduce the compliance costs and uncertainty for many services providers.”

“This is a welcome development for the UK financial and professional services sector, with global services providers set to benefit from the removal of unnecessary administrative processes that can act as barriers to market access around the world.

“Services trade is a key driver of prosperity and this announcement will help to support the global post-Covid recovery.

“We hope that the WTO can carry this momentum into other important future policy challenges.”

In a first of its kind for the WTO, the agreement contains a provision on gender equality. This will support the participation of women entrepreneurs in global services trade and improve the inclusiveness of services trade.

The deal has also created a new baseline in international services trade. The UK has already used it as a foundation when striking free trade agreements with Japan, the European Union, and Australia, building enhanced provisions on services trade upon it.

The scope of the ‘Deport Now Appeal Later’ scheme will be nearly trebled from 8 countries to 23, with foreign nationals from those countries (listed below) now expected to be deported to their home countries before they can appeal against that decision, increasing the UK’s ability to remove foreign criminals at the earliest opportunity, and easing pressure on the detention and prison estate.

Under the expanded scheme, foreign nationals who have had their human rights claim refused will be removed from the UK to their home country before they can appeal the decision. Individuals can then take part in their UK appeal hearing from overseas using video technology.

Previously, offenders from the countries in question could remain in the UK for months or years while their cases were worked through the appeals system, placing a burden on the taxpayer even beyond the end of their prison sentence. The government is in continuous discussions with a range of other countries about joining the scheme.

This represents the government’s latest tool in its comprehensive approach to scaling up our ability to remove foreign criminals. This has seen almost 5,200 removed since July 2024 – an increase of 14% compared to the same 12 months prior and builds on wider action to deliver on the British public’s priorities for safer streets and secure borders through our Plan for Change.

On Sunday, further measures were announced to allow foreign national offenders to be deported immediately after sentencing, saving taxpayer money by removing more foreign criminals directly from our prisons.

In addition, the Home Office is legislating to ensure that asylum seekers who commit notifiable sex offences can be stripped of their right to claim refugee protections under new powers in the Borders Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill.

We have also invested £5 million for the deployment of specialist staff to almost 80 jails with one clear mission – speeding up removals.

Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper said:

For far too long, foreign criminals have been exploiting our immigration system, remaining in the UK for months or even years while their appeals drag on. That has to end. Those who commit crimes in our country cannot be allowed to manipulate the system, which is why we are restoring control and sending a clear message that our laws must be respected and will be enforced.

Foreign Secretary, David Lammy, said:

We are leading diplomatic efforts to increase the number of countries where foreign criminals can be swiftly returned, and if they want to appeal, they can do so safely from their home country. Under this scheme, we’re investing in international partnerships that uphold our security and make our streets safer.

In addition to the measures set out above, the government’s Immigration White Paper in May has also set out new plans to tighten the rules around how Article 8 of the Human Rights Act – the ‘right to a family life’ – may be used when appealing against deportation orders or the rejection of asylum claims, to ensure that the UK’s immigration rules are no longer abused.

These measures support the government’s Plan for Change mission to secure borders through systematic immigration reform. The approach includes returning 35,000 people with no right to remain since July 2024, surging illegal working raids and arrests by 50%, and increasing asylum decision-making by more than 116%.",Expanded 'Deport Now Appeal Later' scheme and legislating for stripping of refugee protections,Legislative,Administrative,id25_290

The two year funding will support enforcement and prevention work by police in three knife crime hotspot areas, alongside positive activities for young people and local work to bring about long-term changes in attitudes and behaviours. The money includes up to:

Police and Crime Commissioners will be introduced in May 2012 and this funding will run from April 2011 to March 2013.

Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘This government is committed to tackling knife crime. Brooke Kinsella has done a great job in highlighting what works and what could work better in trying to achieve that.

‘I am delighted to announce that off the back of Brooke’s recommendations we will invest money into changing attitudes and behaviour, alongside being tough on those who persist in being involved senseless crimes.

‘This new funding will support vital police work where it is most needed and most importantly help young people and local voluntary organisations working at the heart of our communities.’

Brooke Kinsella was asked by the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary to conduct a fact-finding mission into the work taking place around the country to help steer young people away from a life of crime.

Her report makes a number of recommendations including anti-knife crime presentations for school children, more data sharing between police, schools and other agencies on local issues, a best practice website for local organisations and more work with young children to stop them getting involved in knife crime.

Brooke Kinsella said: ‘Over the past few months I have met so many inspirational people, young and old, working tirelessly to tackle knife crime in communities across the country. My report builds on their experiences and recommendations and I am glad it has informed the government’s plans for tackling knife crime.

‘I know that most young people are hard working and law abiding, and I want to make sure no other family has to go through what my family went through.’

The Home Office will also provide up to £20m towards the early intervention grant (via the Department for Education) which local areas can use for crime prevention and up to £18 million for youth offending teams (via the Ministry of Justice) to deliver frontline work, including knife crime prevention programmes, for young offenders.

There has been a record of six reported breeding pairs of ospreys throughout Cumbria this year, which is the highest number since the bird returned to breed in England in 2001.

The Roudsea birds attempted to build a nest on a nearby electricity pylon last year, just outside the reserve. This blew down during last winter’s storms and Electricity North West eagerly offered to fund the construction of a new nesting platform in the nature reserve, on top of a 30 metre-tall Scots pine tree, and within sight of good viewing positions on the reserve. The platform was erected on the 17 March 2014 and by the 2 April the newly arrived ospreys had adopted the platform and were already starting to build their nest.

Little is yet known about the parents – many breeding osprey in England are ringed to help track their movements and support conservation efforts but Roudsea’s breeding female bird is unringed, and could have come from Scotland or Scandinavia. She will soon start her return migration to Africa, whilst dad will remain for the next few weeks to make sure his offspring know how to fish, before they too return south.

Roudsea Wood and Mosses National Nature Reserve in South Cumbria is one of the most important wildlife sites in England. An extensive mosaic of ancient woodlands, raised bogs, fens, reedbeds and saltmarsh provide habitat for a range of species including otter, kingfisher, dormouse, several species of rare butterfly and insects. Visitors to the reserve, have had unbridled views in the last few weeks of the attentive parents, catching and bringing in fish, including mullet to feed the hungry and fast developing young.

Rob Petley Jones, Natural England’s Senior Reserve Manager at Roudsea Wood and Mosses National Nature Reserve said; “We are overjoyed at their breeding success - It’s been brilliant to watch the family’s progress. We’ve worked hard here for many years to manage the site for wildlife and feel rewarded that the conditions are right to encourage these rare birds to nest here. We’ve all been keeping our fingers crossed that the birds would return after last year’s initial nesting attempt, and it was great to have the enthusiastic support from Electricity North West who funded the construction of the new platform. Visitors to the reserve have also been fascinated with views of the male bird regularly bringing back huge flapping fish for his mate and their growing offspring. We look forward to welcoming them back again next year.”

Daniel Garner, delivery manager for Electricity North West, said: “We were delighted to be able to help Natural England by sponsoring the new Osprey nesting platform at Roudsea Wood and Mosses National Nature Reserve. These amazing birds previously nested on a nearby electricity pylon, which could have potentially caused issues if our engineers needed to carry out maintenance work, so it was important that we offered them a safe alternative. We’re looking forward to welcoming the ospreys back next year and will continue to assist Natural England in any way we can.”

Natural England also has plans to install a webcam and improve access at the reserve for people to view the birds if they return next year. 2015 will also mark the Diamond Jubilee for the reserve.

Today, there are between 200 and 250 pairs of breeding osprey in Britain, but most of these are in Scotland, where it recolonized in 1954. There are also a small number of breeding pairs inRutland WaterandKielder Forest, Northumberland. They visit the UK from Africa to breed in late March, before making the return journey in September. They feed exclusively on fish, which they catch with impressive dives into the water.

Most of Natural England’s National Nature Reserves are free and open to the public. Natural England lease Roudsea Woods from the Holker Estate, and a permit to visit this nature reserve is required. This is available from Rob Petley-Jones, Senior Reserves Manager:rob.petley-jones@naturalengland.org.uk. Natural England is drawing up plans to improve access for those wanting to view the birds when they hopefully return next year.

National Nature Reserves are some of the very finest sites in England for wildlife and geology, and provide great opportunities for people to experience nature. They have been established to protect and manage the special wildlife habitats, species and geological features that occur there. These features are of national and often international importance, and many NNRs are important for study and research. Almost all NNRs have some form of access provision – many are fully open throughout the year. There are 224 throughout England.",Funding of the new Osprey nesting platform,Monetary,,id25_292

New support for both graduates and trusts to improve recruitment processes and ensure a seamless transition from training to employment

Better staffing of the NHS, part of Plan for Change to build an NHS fit for the future and improve care for patients

Thousands of new jobs will be unlocked across the healthcare sector thanks to government action to make sure there are enough jobs for every newly qualified nurse and midwife in England.

The government’s Graduate Guarantee will ensure thousands of new posts are easier to access by removing barriers for trusts, creating a wealth of opportunities for graduates and ensuring a seamless transition from training to employment.

These new measures aim to tackle graduates’ concerns about job availability, after record numbers of people chose to study nursing during the pandemic, while fewer nurses and midwives leave the profession.

While this demonstrates real progress in health professionals choosing to stay and thrive in their NHS careers, it has created barriers in the workforce - with up to 3 times as many graduates as there are vacancies in some areas.

To address this, the government has committed to a comprehensive package of reform and support, which will see more healthcare professionals deployed across a wide variety of sectors, improving access for patients as part of ourPlan for Change.

This package comes as a result of collegiate and good faith working between government, the Royal College of Midwives and the Royal College of Nursing, demonstrating that by working together, the NHS, patients and staff all benefit.

Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Wes Streeting, said:

It is absurd that we are training thousands of nurses and midwives every year, only to leave them without a job before their career has started.

No one who dedicates themselves to a nursing or midwifery career should be left in limbo, when their skills are so urgently needed in the effort to rebuild our NHS.

I am sending a clear message to every newly qualified nurse and midwife: we’re here to support you from day one so you can provide the best care for patients and cut waiting lists. This new guarantee will benefit nurses, midwives and patients, helping to build an NHS fit for the future as part of our Plan for Change.

NHS providers will begin recruiting newly qualified nurses and midwives before vacancies formally arise, with trusts supported to employ staff based on projected need rather than headcount, ensuring the NHS has the right number of staff to provide the best possible care to patients everywhere.

Additionally, every newly qualified nurse and midwife will receive the backing they need to succeed in their first role, which includes an online hub with important information and advice for those applying for roles.

Vacant maternity support worker posts will be temporarily converted to Band 5 midwifery roles, backed by £8 million to create new opportunities specifically for newly qualified midwives and further ease the recruitment strain.

Chief Nursing Officer for England, Duncan Burton, said:

Having been a student nurse, I know how important it is to feel supported, valued, and able to get on with the job you have trained so hard to do.

Every nurse and midwife deserves the guarantee of a job to apply for when they graduate, so we’re unlocking more opportunities right across health and care and providing refreshed online advice and support with applications to help ensure a smooth transition into employment.

We have more nurses and midwives than ever before choosing to stay working in the NHS, which is fantastic for patients, but we must ensure our newest graduates get the same opportunity to put their skills and passion to use without frustrating delays.

Royal College of Nursing General Secretary and Chief Executive, Professor Nicola Ranger, said:

Our student members have led the way in calling for ministers and healthcare leaders to provide certainty and clarity on jobs. Today’s announcement is welcome news that should provide hope to students as they come towards the end of their education and training.

When the health service urgently needs nursing staff, it was absurd to leave people in limbo. The test of this will be if students can find jobs, vacant posts are filled, and patients receive the care they deserve.

Ministers have to continue listening to nursing staff who are crying out to have their critical work valued - today’s action takes us all a little closer.

Gill Walton, Chief Executive of the Royal College of Midwives, said:

We’re pleased that the government has listened to the voices of student midwives who are desperate to start their career, only to find those opportunities blocked. I know today’s announcement will come as a relief to so many of theRCM’s student midwife members.

These are people, mainly women, who have worked incredibly hard to complete their degree and are trained and ready to support our current midwifery workforce at a time when so many maternity services are under pressure. Ensuring we have the right midwifery staff, in the right places, at the right time, with the right education and training has never been so crucial as services are striving to improve safety.

Today’s new package of support is centred on patient care and the nursing and midwifery workforce, signalling a fundamental shift towards valuing and nurturing newly qualified professionals from day one of their careers, backed by investing in training and guaranteeing employment opportunities.

For newly qualified nurses and midwives, these changes mean greater certainty and access to a wide and diverse range of roles.

For the health service, they mean better workforce planning, improved retention and enhanced capacity to deliver patient care. For patients, they mean shorter waiting times and access to a well-supported, confident workforce.

Our Plan for Change is already delivering on making the NHS fit for the future, by working with staff to improve working conditions and ultimately patients’ experience.

Paul Rees MBE, Chief Executive and Registrar of the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), said:

A guaranteed opportunity for a role after years of hard work in education is excellent news for future nursing and midwifery graduates. It means highly trained professionals can move into roles more quickly, utilising their skills and knowledge for the benefit of patients and communities.

This is critically important at a time of rising demand for health and social care. We will continue working to place all new graduates on our register quickly and safely, so they can begin their roles at the earliest opportunity.

Steph Lawrence MBE, Chief Executive at the Queen’s Institute of Community Nursing (QICN), said:

TheQICNwelcomes this news which will ensure we retain our newly registered nurses and also give them a good start to their journey as a registered nurse. It will be essential to ensure this occurs across all sectors of the NHS and in particular in community, given the shift from hospital to community.

Vivienne Stern MBE, Chief Executive at Universities UK, said:

Our healthcare graduates power the NHS and this guarantee of additional support into employment is good news for students, the NHS and the country. This commitment comes at the perfect time as thousands of healthcare students prepare to start their university experience.

Our NHS is the envy of the world, and our universities stand ready to strengthen their partnerships with the NHS to deliver the workforce pipeline on which the future health sector depends.",Graduate Guarantee,Administrative,,id25_293

Consumer protection law requires refunds within 14 days.

TUI UK has engaged constructively with the CMA throughout the investigation and while the vast majority of  people have already received their refunds or rebooked during the CMA’s investigation, any outstanding refund requests for people who had their package holiday cancelled as a result of coronavirus (COVID-19) will be paid by 30 September 2020.

Some customers may have accepted Refund Credit Notes. It is important they know they are entitled to a cash refund as an alternative. TUI UK has now given formal commitments to the CMA to contact customers who have an unused credit note, to let them know they can convert it to a refund, which will be paid within 14 days.

The CMA wants to ensure that TUI UK meets its obligation to pay refunds on time in the future. Therefore, TUI UK will report regularly to the CMA over the coming year on the time it has taken to refund customers

These commitments apply to all of TUI UK’s different businesses that offer package holidays, including First Choice, First Choice Holidays, Marella Cruises, Crystal Ski, Crystal, TUI Scene, TUI Lakes & Mountains and Skytours.

Today’s announcement follows significant action by the CMA on cancellations in the holiday sector. It has written to over 100 package holiday businesses to remind them of their obligations to comply with consumer protection law and has opened investigations into a number of operators.

The CMA understands that the pandemic has created extraordinary pressure for travel companies, including TUI UK. However, customers who had their holidays cancelled because of coronavirus must be treated fairly and receive their refunds promptly. It is essential that that all businesses comply with consumer protection law so that people are not being left out of pocket. TheCMA published guidancefor businesses earlier this year to help them understand their legal obligations.

Andrea Coscelli, the CMA’s Chief Executive, said:

It’s absolutely essential that people have trust and confidence when booking package holidays and know that if a cancellation is necessary as a result of coronavirus, businesses will give them a full, prompt refund. The CMA’s action ensures that TUI UK customers will get their refunds by the end of the month.

The CMA is continuing to investigate package holiday firms in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. If we find that businesses are not complying with consumer protection law, we will not hesitate to take further action.

The findings from Beauhurst also reveal that roles in technology overall pay an average of 55% more the national average.

This comes as the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) launches a drive to get more people to sign up to digital Skills Bootcamps in cloud computing, cybersecurity, software development and more.

The research, published by Barclays Eagle Labs and Beauhurst, and funded byDSIT’s Digital Growth Grant, shows that demand for technology talent surged in 2022 after a slump through the pandemic.

While tech job adverts decreased through the last year, demand for junior and entry-level roles persisted as technology companies struggled to recruit the early career talent they needed to match their growth ambitions.

The campaign runs alongside wider government efforts to reward work and drive growth – such as cutting National Insurance Contributions for millions of workers across the UK, which saves the average worker £450 a year.

Scale-up companies who have already demonstrated high potential and are in their ‘venture-stage’ dominated this demand, with the high-growth group recruiting almost one third (31.3%) of all digital jobs.

After establishing boosting scale-up growth and tackling the skills gap as two ofDSIT’s three priorities for the year ahead, Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan today said:

The appetite and potential British scale-ups have for growth is immense, we can no longer allow digital skills shortages to limit their ambition.

Whether your personal ambition is to secure a comfy pay packet, land a creative role, solve the world’s most pressing challenges, or all three – the Skills Bootcamps we are promoting today can help achieve your own career goals while being part of our superpower sector.

Each bootcamp will see people take part in courses that last up to 16 weeks and will prepare them for high-tech careers, with each guaranteed an interview on completion. No technical knowledge or educational qualifications are required to secure a place.More information and details on how to apply are available here.

Digital skills is one of several areas where £550 million of funding is aiming to upskill 64000 people through bootcamps by 2024-2025.

Launched byDSIT, the campaign is focussed on boosting five priority skills to plug gaps in British tech talent – covering cloud computing, software development, data and analytics, cybersecurity, and web development.

The courses are available part-time and full-time across the country, with many providers offering flexibilities to make sure that everyone can take advantage.

Adie Nunn completed a web development bootcamp with School of Code, which was funded by the government, and now works atBAESystems Digital Intelligence.

Before finding the bootcamp, Adie hopped between jobs through what she describes as a “spotty” career. This included working as an event promoter for a pub company and later as front of house for pop-up events.

I was interested in computers and tech from a young age. But, without a computer science degree – and having failed my highers in maths and computing at school – I never thought a career in tech would be possible.

After jumping between roles and being made redundant in the pandemic, I gave the School of Code bootcamp a go and have never looked back. The technical and soft skills I developed on the course were crucial in securing my current role as a software engineer atBAESystems Digital Intelligence where I get to work on fascinating, challenging projects.

The Skills Bootcamp Adie completed was funded by the Department for Education (DfE) as part of the same scheme that is receiving a new marketing push from today. The School of Code is still offering Bootcamps as part of this.

The campaign has been supported by theDigital Skills Council, a group of major technology companies including Google and Amazon Web Services (AWS), as well as skills-focused organisations like Future Dot Now and more.

Phil Smith, Co-Chair of the Digital Skills Council and Chairman of IQE, said:

The Digital Skills Council welcomes this research which reinforces just how important the work and goals of the Council are in bringing together government and industry to improve the confidence, capability and leadership of the UK in Digital Skills.

Digital Skills are vital throughout the economy and existing successful programs such as bootcamps play an important role in providing relevant and focused up-skilling and a proven path into high value enjoyable jobs.

Katie O’Donovan, Director of Government Affairs and Public Policy at Google and Digital Skills Council Member added:

We’re committed to helping people learn the skills they need to make the most of the country’s digital economy. That’s why since 2015 we’ve visited over 500 locations across the UK and helped more than 1 million people learn new valuable digital skills. Courses like the Google Cloud engineer bootcamps open up a world of opportunities for young people, helping them to kickstart successful careers in tech and increase their earning potential.

We’re proud to be part of this important initiative, and we look forward to continuing this work with the government to equip more people with the skills needed to drive growth across the UK’s technology sector.

Amanda Allan, Director of Barclays Eagle Labs, said:

The new Eagle Labs report outlines what we have known for some time, that the technology sector continues to grow, with highly paid opportunities available. Vacancies with such high median salaries shows there is clear potential for the tech sector to improve prospects for people right across the UK.

We think it is important to continue to facilitate growth in the technology sector, which is why we offer one of the largest entrepreneurial networks in the UK. The Digital Growth Grant forms part of this work and we are immensely proud of what has been achieved so far with 13 growth programmes supporting over one thousand businesses.

Tanuja Randery, EMEA Managing Director, Amazon Web Services said:

We want to make it easy for everyone to have access to the skills and training they need to grow their careers.AWSis investing hundreds of millions of pounds to provide a wide range of free cloud skills and AI training to people from all walks of life and all levels of knowledge.

This includes homegrown UK programmes such asAWSre/Start, which prepares learners from unemployed and underemployed populations, who have little technology experience, for careers in the cloud – at no cost to the learner. Affordable and robust training programmes will be integral to creating a future pipeline of talent to ensure that the UK can continue to compete on a global tech stage.

Hugh Milward, VP, External Affairs at Microsoft UK, said:

The Advanced Digital Skills communications campaign is a really welcome initiative. At Microsoft, we believe that digital skills will be critical to creating opportunities for all in the era of AI, and we are committed to helping bridge the skills gap.

Our programs, such as the apprenticeship connector, DigiGirlz, and our commitment to supporting AI training for 1 million people in the UK, provide opportunities for individuals to learn about technology and careers in the field. We are excited to see the impact of this campaign on individuals seeking to get into digital careers.

Andrew Roughan, CEO at Plexal, said:

Closing the skills gap in the UK’s tech sector is essential for us to remain a competitive nation and deliver on the government ambition of becoming a science and tech superpower by 2030.

In order for our companies to achieve scale, they need the right people to grow with them. So, I’m pleased to see our young people receiving more opportunities to enter the tech sector outside of the university path. I’d also encourage businesses to ensure ongoing upskilling of their existing staff to create a continued talent pipeline that will be of ongoing benefit the UK economy.

Visiting only a week after taking up office, Mr Huhne toured stands at the All Energy renewables exhibition, visited oil firm Apache and met industry leaders at Oil and Gas UK.

Image: The Rt Hon Chris Huhne MP at the All Energy renewables exhibition.



Mr Huhne said:

My in tray is heavy with two massive responsibilities - cutting dangerous carbon emissions and ensuring secure and reliable energy supplies. This city has a crucial role to play in both of these and our ambition to create a low carbon economy.

Aberdeen is the UK’s power house, our energy capital. Its workforce is respected the world over, its contribution to our economy and our energy security beyond question. And it is increasingly staking a claim as a leader in the new low carbon energy technologies that will help us tackle climate change.

The UK’s indigenous oil and gas continues to play a crucial part in our energy security, even as we aspire to a low carbon future.

This is a vibrant industry but there is no room for complacency. There could be 20 billion barrels of oil equivalent left to exploit but the UK competes against every other basin in the world for investment and I am committed to make sure that we have a licensing regime and investment environment that attracts quality companies and investment to fully exploit the remaining potential. We will work closely with the industry to ensure that we can achieve just that.

Energy security, for too long a second order issue, will be put back at the heart of our national security strategy. The oil and gas sector should take encouragement from that.

At the same time we have a shortening window for action to prevent the most damaging impacts of climate change.

One of the biggest scandals is that we’ve got one of the best renewable energy resources anywhere in the world - and the know how to exploit it - and yet we’re one of the worst performing countries when it comes to harnessing it.

There are a lot of opportunities in the rapidly expanding renewable energy sector which need to be taken advantage of. The expertise and skills that have been vital to the oil and gas sector are transferable and will be key to the renewable energy sector as it develops, and are especially relevant for offshore wind.

The renewables industry will come of age under this Government. It’s early days but our coalition agreement is explicit in its support for the sector.

The prize is too great to let this opportunity pass us by.

Green Deal Providers will be able to access finance through TGDFC, enabling them to offer low cost finance packages to consumers upgrading their homes under the Green Deal.

The Green Deal is also being considered as an early candidate for the use of infrastructure guarantees, Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, announced today. This demonstrates the Government’s commitment to working with the private sector to provide finance at a low but sustainable cost to Green Deal customers. Infrastructure guarantees will provide guarantees for major UK infrastructure projects and could potentially support up to £40 billion of investment.

From today, the register for Green Deal Providers, Assessors and Installers will also open. The register will give the seal of approval to businesses that successfully go through the Green Deal authorisation process.

All authorised Green Deal Providers, Assessors and Installers will have to display the new Green Deal Quality Mark to demonstrate they comply with the required Green Deal standards. This will be vital for protecting customers from any rogue traders. Only registered and authorised businesses will be able to use this mark.

Energy and Climate Change Minister Greg Barker said:

“I’m delighted to announce a number of important developments for the Green Deal today. The opening of the Green Deal register will enable businesses to start becoming Green Deal authorised and the Green Deal Quality Mark will show they have met our standards. Crucially, this will protect consumers, who will know that anyone displaying the Quality Mark has been through the required process to become authorised.

“The loan we have agreed with The Green Deal Finance Company will help them to undertake essential development and be ready to offer finance to Green Deal Providers in early 2013.”

Businesses wishing to become Green Deal Providers can apply directly online to become authorised, while accredited certification bodies will be able to submit the details of Assessors and Installers to be authorised.

New guidance is available on the DECC website which clearly explains what is required to get the Green Deal Quality Mark and to become an authorised Provider. This complements existing guidance setting out how to become an authorised Assessor or Installer.

The Green Deal will open up the energy efficiency market, empowering new players, including small and medium sized businesses, to enter and innovate.

299,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nuclear-energy-what-you-need-to-know,News story,Nuclear energy: What you need to know,A summary of the benefits of nuclear power and what the government is doing to support its development in the UK.,"Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street, The Rt Hon Kwasi Kwarteng and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson",6 April 2022,"In light of high global gas prices, we need to ensure Britain’s future energy supply is bolstered by reliable, affordable, low carbon power that is generated in this country.

New nuclear is not only an important part ofour plans to ensure greater energy independence, but to create high-quality jobs and drive economic growth.

Large-scale nuclear is a very low-carbon technology, which provides the reliable baseload power we need at scale from a very small land area; Hinkley Point C, for example, will power around 6 million homes from a just a quarter of a square mile.

Yes. As confirmed by the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency, nuclear power plants ‘are among the safest and most secure facilities in the world,’ and nuclear power is one of the safest forms of energy generation.

For context, the annual radiation dose to an adult living beside a new nuclear plant is much less than taking one trans-Atlantic flight or eating 100g of Brazil nuts – neither of which have heavy radiation.

In the UK, we have a well-respected regulatory system which reflects international best practice, and an industry which places an extremely high value on safety, achieving world-leading health and safety standards every time it is examined.

Nuclear power has operated in the UK for decades without incident, and all UK nuclear operators are answerable to robust and independent regulators – the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the appropriate environmental regulator. If the ONR judged that any nuclear installation was not safe or secure it would not be allowed to operate.

Traditional nuclear power plants use heat produced during nuclear fission to produce steam. The steam is used to spin large turbines that generate electricity. Nuclear power plants heat water.

In nuclear fission, atoms are split apart to form smaller atoms, releasing energy. Fission takes place inside the reactor of a nuclear power plant. At the centre of the reactor is the core, which contains uranium fuel split into ceramic pellets.

Each ceramic pellet produces about the same amount of energy as 150 gallons of oil. These energy-rich pellets are stacked end-to-end in 12-foot metal fuel rods. A bundle of fuel rods, some with hundreds of rods, is called a fuel assembly. A reactor core contains many fuel assemblies.

Both the Committee on Climate Change and the International Energy Agency have highlighted the role for new nuclear electricity generating capacity, in partnership with renewables, as a key element of achieving net zero. A recent report by the UN Economic Commission for Europe was clear that “the world’s climate objectives will not be met if nuclear technologies are excluded” from future decarbonisation.

The government is committed to using Geological Disposal Facilities (GDF) to dispose of nuclear waste.

GDF is internationally recognised as the best long-term solution for dealing with radioactive waste.

We need a sustainable solution for the radioactive waste that has already accumulated over many decades. It’s currently stored safely in facilities around the UK, but this isn’t a long term solution and we will be moving towards geological disposal for new and existing waste.

Local engagement events are underway for local people to find out more about a GDF and what it would mean for the community that hosts it.

A GDF is a multi-billion-pound infrastructure investment and will provide skilled jobs and benefits to the community that hosts it for more than 100 years. It is also likely to involve major investments in local transport facilities and other infrastructure.

The strategywill see a significant acceleration of nuclear, with an ambition of up to 24GW by 2050 to come from this safe, clean, and reliable source of power. This would represent up to around 25% of our projected electricity demand. Subject to technology readiness from industry, Small Modular Reactors will form a key part of the nuclear project pipeline.

A new government body, Great British Nuclear, will be set up immediately to bring forward new projects, backed by substantial funding, and we will launch the £120 million Future Nuclear Enabling Fund this month. We will work to progress a series of projects as soon as possible this decade, including Wylfa site in Anglesey. This could mean delivering up to 8 reactors, equivalent to one reactor a year instead of one a decade, accelerating nuclear in Britain.

We are committed to building the first new nuclear power station in a generation at Hinkley Point C in Somerset, which will provide 3.2 GW of secure, low carbon electricity for around 60 years to power around 6 million homes and provide 25,000 job opportunities.

EDF are the lead investor building Hinkley Point C. They are targeting the first reactor coming online in June 2026. The developer is fully funding the project.

We have been in constructive negotiations on the Sizewell C project in Suffolk since January 2021, as the most advanced potential project in the UK. If approved Sizewell C would be a replica of Hinkley Point C, providing electricity for 6 million homes, and creating thousands of high value jobs nationwide.

In January we provided £100 million of funding for the Sizewell C developer to invest in the project to help bring it to maturity, attract investors, and advance to the next phase in negotiations.

As set out in the 2021 Spending Review, up to £1.7 billion of funding is available to support approval of at least one new nuclear power plant this Parliament.

The Nuclear Energy (Financing) Act received Royal Assent last week. The Act will enable use of the Regulated Asset Base funding model for new nuclear projects, which will unblock obstacles to developing these projects and cut the cost of financing them.

The Advanced Nuclear Fund  includes up to £210 million announced in November 2021 for Rolls-Royce to develop the design for one of the world’s first Small Modular Reactors. This could be deployed in the UK in the early 2030s to turbocharge UK nuclear capacity.

We are also establishing a new Future Nuclear Enabling Fund of up to £120 million to provide targeted support for new nuclear and make it easier for new companies to enter the market.

Small Modular Reactors are smaller versions of conventional water-cooled nuclear reactors. Designs come in different sizes but have power output roughly a fifth to a third of the larger and more traditional reactors at Hinkley Point C.

There are a wide range of new reactor technologies under development around the world. Many designs have the potential for a range of applications beyond low-carbon electricity generation, including production of hydrogen, direct heat for industrial or domestic use or nuclear waste management.

The UK government believes that SMRs could play an important role alongside large nuclear as a low-carbon energy source to support a secure, affordable decarbonised energy system. They can be easily manufactured away from the sites where they are used and deployed where needed and could be a transformative technology for the UK’s industrial heartlands.

AMRs are the next generation of nuclear power. These reactors use novel and innovative fuels, coolants, and technologies to generate extreme heat for industrial applications as well as for electricity to power people’s homes.

They take advantage of the same modular-building principles as SMRs, making them more flexible to deploy.

We have committed up to £385 million in the Advanced Nuclear Fund (ANF) to support SMRs and AMR development. This includes up to £210 million awarded as a grant to Rolls-Royce SMR to develop their SMR design, which will be matched by industry.

This fund will be part of the measures the government will take to inform investment decisions during the next Parliament on further nuclear projects.

The ANF also includes funding for progressing plans for an ambitious Advanced Modular Research, Development & Demonstration (RD&D) programme which aims to enable an AMR demonstration by the early 2030s, at the latest. We recently announced that High Temperature Gas Reactors (HTGRs) will be the technology focus for this programme.

The timeframe for new nuclear projects coming online varies considerably depending on a range of factors.

Large-scale nuclear projects do have long-construction periods, but Small Modular Reactors for example could be deployable during the early 2030s, with innovation in manufacturing and construction having the potential to bring down build time further.

EDF, which operates all of the UK’s Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors (AGRs) as well as Sizewell B, have extended the lifetime of many of the power stations built in the 1970s and ‘80s in the UK.

However, when nuclear stations reach the end of their generating capability, they move into the next phase of their lives which is to remove the fuel and to prepare for decommissioning.

This process is handled by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), a government agency with high-level technical expertise in handling this process in a safe and secure manner.

There are currently 6 generating stations across England and Scotland operated by EDF Energy. Sizewell B, the UK’s only Pressurised Water Reactor, is expected to continue generation past 2028.

The AGR stations at Torness, Hinkley Point B, Heysham 1, Heysham 2 and Hartlepool will end generation between 2022 and 2028.

Two other AGR stations, Dungeness B and Hunterston B, recently ended generation to move into the final defueling phase and then decommissioning.

In terms of future use for these sites, the NDA have a clear mission to safely decommission them, freeing up land for future uses.

The NDA welcomes engagement from all stakeholders with a potential future use of land and have a history of engagement and land transfer across their portfolio.","The Advanced Nuclear Fund (ANF) and the Nuclear Energy (Financing) Act, alongside the Future Nuclear Enabling Fund and the Regulated Asset Base funding model.",Monetary,Legislative,id25_299

But it is not designed to prevent new gas-fired power stations. One in five of our ageing power stations is due to close in the next decade and it is impossible to build enough low-carbon capacity in that time. A gas plant is relatively quick to build and provides flexible back-up. As most new gas plants will be replacing coal plants, there is also a big win for reducing carbon emissions. Assurances that the emissions limit won’t be cut unexpectedly are important to investors.

The Chancellor has introduced a floor to the carbon price, rising over time, providing a disincentive to carbon-emitting electricity. And we intend to legislate to provide for long-term contracts for renewables, new nuclear and carbon capture and storage.

Alongside the Government’s response to the Smart Meters Prospectus consultation, the Department of Energy and Climate Change has set out the overall strategy and timetable for the installation of 53 million smart meters in 30 million homes and businesses across Great Britain, estimated to have a net benefit to the nation of £7.3 billion over the next twenty years.

Speaking ahead of his visit today to a technology expo at the SmartLIFE training centre in Cambridge, where exhibitors include businesses specialising in smart meter technology, Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change The Rt Hon Chris Huhne MP said:

“Smart meters are a key part of giving us all more control over how we use energy at home and at work, helping us to cut out waste and save money.

“In combination with our plans to reform the electricity market and introduce the Green Deal for home and businesses, the rollout of smart meters will help us keep the lights on while reducing emissions and getting the best possible deal for the consumer.”

Energy Minister Charles Hendry said:

“Ensuring a secure energy supply, moving to a low-carbon economy and keeping prices affordable are the key challenges that drive our energy and environmental policies. That is why the full rollout of smart meters to homes and businesses is a fundamental part of our programme for government.

“Smart meters will enable us to modernise the electricity system over the coming years and create the smart grids we will need to bring new low carbon energy sources online, and handle much higher demand for electricity as we progressively electrify transport and heating.”

Smart meters will deliver a range of benefits to consumers, energy suppliers and networks:

The rollout of smart meters will take place in two phases. During the foundation stage, beginning now, the Government will work with industry, consumer groups and other stakeholders to ensure all the necessary groundwork is done for the second stage, the mass rollout.

The foundation stage will enable the industry to build and test all the systems required to start the mass rollout, ensuring positive consumer engagement and delivering energy saving benefits. A key part of this will be learning from early installations. It will also enable the companies to test and learn what works best for consumers, and how to help people get the best from their meters. During this stage the Government will also establish the Data and Communications Company, which will provide data and communications services for the smart metering system nationwide.

The Government expects the mass rollout to start in early 2014 and to be completed in 2019.",Rollout of smart meters,Administrative,Informational,id25_301

At today’s meeting, representatives discussed the future options for the refinery and the work the administrators are doing to secure a sustainable future for the plant.

The Minister reiterated Government’s commitment to help those workers who are at risk of losing their jobs if the refinery closes. He also set out the broader context of overcapacity in the refining industry and declining demand for petrol in the UK and Europe.

The meeting also focussed on what Government and local partners doing, alongside the administrators, to safeguard as many local jobs as possible.

Charles Hendry said:

“From the outset of this process, we have worked tirelessly with the administrator to find a way to secure a successful outcome for Coryton and to safeguard local jobs.

“It is extremely disappointing that the administrators have not found a buyer for the refinery, despite their strong efforts. .Unfortunately considerable additional investment is needed to keep the refinery operating efficiently, and this has meant that potential bidders have been faced with high upfront investments to make in the order of some hundreds of millions.

“In addition, UK refineries face tough competition from other refineries in Europe and increasingly in Asia, which means that profit margins are low and there is overcapacity in the sector.  It is clearly a very tough market and these conditions on their own make the sale of Coryton as a refinery challenging.

“We looked long and hard at whether or not State Aid should be provided for Coryton. But, we came to the conclusion that the existing overcapacity in the refining industry and declining demand for petrol means that it would not be sustainable.

“If Government did step in to help Coryton, this would be a short-term fix, and it could potentially lead to job losses at other refineries who would be at an unfair disadvantage.

“We realise this is a really worrying time for those who work at the refinery in Coryton, for their families and their communities more generally. We will be doing whatever we can to support people through this difficult period.

“If it is not possible to find someone keen to take forward this investment as a business then Government is committed to help Thurrock Council and its taskforce through a range of different government departments, to make sure we mitigate the job losses as best as we can.

“To this end, we are already working closely with local agencies and Jobcentre Plus to ensure the right support is in place to help these skilled workers find new posts.”

The property is valued at around £1.5 million and is owned by Claire Schools, the ex-wife of the convicted solicitor Timothy Schools, who was sentenced to 14 years in prison in 2022.

The SFO successfully secured an order today to freeze the property to ensure that, if sold, the proceeds are secured. Ms Schools has also been ordered to produce information about how the property was obtained within 28 days. The SFO may use this information to bring a case to seize the house at a later date.

This order follows the confiscation of a further £1 million from Schools in a hearing at Southwark Crown Court earlier this month.

A UWO is an investigative tool used to determine the source of funding for an asset, where there is reasonable suspicion that it was acquired with the proceeds of crime. If the recipient fails to prove that the asset was acquired legitimately, the SFO may apply to seize it at the High Court.

This is the first UWO used by the SFO since they were introduced by parliament in 2017. The SFO is the second law enforcement authority to ever use the tool.

Under the advice, those eligible for a further dose will be:

In addition, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) will be widening the offer of the free flu vaccine to more eligible groups. These additional groups will only be eligible once the most vulnerable, including previously announced pre-school and primary school children, those aged 65 years and over and those in clinical risk groups, have been offered the jab.

The additional groups set to be offered the free flu vaccine in England will be:

The NHS will announce in due course when and how eligible groups will be able to book an appointment for their COVID-19 autumn booster, and when people aged 50 to 64 years old who are not in a clinical risk group will be able to get their free flu jab.

People in these groups are asked not to come forward until further information is announced.

Commenting on the autumn COVID-19 booster programme, Professor Anthony Harnden, Deputy Chair of theJCVI, said:

We have provided our final recommendations for the autumn programme to ensure the NHS and wider health system has time to plan a vaccine rollout well ahead of the winter season.

The COVID-19 boosters are highly effective at increasing immunity and, by offering a further dose to those at higher risk of severe illness this autumn, we hope to significantly reduce the risk of hospitalisations and deaths over the winter.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation atUKHSA, said:

Widening the eligibility for the flu vaccine will help reduce the number of people getting seriously ill and ease pressures on the NHS, particularly during the busy winter period.

It is also important that everyone eligible for the COVID-19 booster gets the jab when invited, including pregnant women, who are among those at higher risk. Having COVID-19 during pregnancy can lead to complications. Getting the vaccine, including a booster, offers the best possible protection for you and your baby.

The government has unveiled 55 towns that will benefit from a £1.1 billion levelling up investment, as part of a long-term plan for towns that provide long-term investment in towns that have been overlooked and taken for granted.

Towns that will be given the opportunity to develop a long-term plan supported by a Towns Board include 6 in the North East, 10 in the North West, and 4 in the West Midlands. In total, 55 towns will benefit from the UK-wide approach, including 7 towns in Scotland and 4 in Wales.

The government will work with local councils and the devolved administrations to determine how towns in Scotland and Wales will benefit from funding and powers under the long-term plans. In Northern Ireland, we look forward to working with a restored Executive to determine the approach to providing support there.

Under the new approach, local people, not Whitehall-based politicians, will be put in charge, and given the tools to change their town’s long-term future. They will:

More than half the population live in towns, but half-empty high streets, run-down town centres and anti-social behaviour undermine towns in every part of the UK. Today’s announcement marks a change in approach that will put an end to people feeling like their town is ignored by Westminster and empower communities to take back control of their future, taking long term decisions in the interests of local people.

This plan builds on the government’s central mission to level up the UK by putting more power and money in the hands of people who know their areas best to build a brighter future for their community, creating bespoke initiatives that will spark the regeneration needed.

Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, said:

Towns are the place most of us call home and where most of us go to work. But politicians have always taken towns for granted and focused on cities.

The result is the half-empty high streets, run-down shopping centres and anti-social behaviour that undermine many towns’ prosperity and hold back people’s opportunity – and without a new approach, these problems will only get worse.

That changes today. Our Long-Term Plan for Towns puts funding in the hands of local people themselves to invest in line with their priorities, over the long-term. That is how we level up.

Levelling Up Secretary, Michael Gove said:

We know that in our towns the values of hard work and solidarity, common sense and common purpose, endeavour and quiet patriotism have endured across generations. But for too long, too many of our great British towns have been overlooked and undervalued.

We are putting this right through our Long-Term Plan for Towns backed by over £1 billion of levelling up funding.

This will empower communities in every part of the UK to take back control of their future, taking long term decisions in the interests of local people. It will mean more jobs, more opportunities and a brighter future for our towns and the people who live and work in them.

OurLong-Term Plan for Towns, published today (1 October 2023), is carefully designed to complement the wider levelling up programme, working alongside funding for specific projects across the UK, our targeted support to the places most in need through Levelling Up Partnerships, and initiatives supporting economic growth in wider city regions like investment zones.

The Long-Term Plan for Towns will require town boards to develop their own long-term plan for their town, with funding over 10 years and aligned to the issues that research shows people want the most, including:

Local people will be at the heart of decisions, through direct membership of a new Towns Board, which will include community groups, MPs, businesses, cultural and sports organisations, public sector agencies and local authorities for each town and through a requirement to engage local people on the long-term plan for each town.

These Town Boards will have direct government support in addition to the funding and powers they receive through Long-Term Plan for Towns, and will be required to engage local people on their long-term plan.

The government has also announced a new ‘Towns Taskforce, sitting in the Department for Levelling Up and reporting directly to the Prime Minister and Levelling Up Secretary. This will help town boards to develop their plans, and advise them on how best to take advantage of government policies, unlock private and philanthropic investment and work with communities.

A new ‘High Streets and Towns Task Force’ will also be established, building on the success of the existing version, providing each selected town with bespoke, hands-on support.

Towns have been allocated funding according to the Levelling Up Needs Index which takes into account metrics covering skills, pay, productivity and health, as well as the Index of Multiple Deprivation to ensure funding goes directly to the towns which will benefit most, without new competitions or unnecessary hurdles. A fullmethodology notehas been published.

This commitment to towns follows other initiatives designed to support towns, including driving economic growth in 101 areas through the Towns Fund, and the £1 billion Future High Streets Fund, which is creating thriving high streets.

Local authorities will be the lead delivery partner for plans.  This programme has been developed following our work with local authorities, with funding designed to be spent flexibly over a number of years based on local and evolving needs, and distributed through an allocative rather than competitive process.",Towns Board and Allocative Funding Process,Institutional,Administrative,id25_307

The new contracts offer a range of improvements, with a particular focus on assisting individuals through the asylum system. They will ensure that vulnerable asylum seekers have access to the support they need and set clear requirements on the standard and condition of accommodation.

Under the new contracts, providers will be required to have proactive maintenance plans, to make sure that they regularly inspect properties and report back to the Home Office on the findings of these inspections. When issues are identified, providers will be expected to resolve them within set timescales.

The Home Office formally awarded contracts to the following providers:

Migrant Help have also been awarded the contract for the Advice, Issue Reporting and Eligibility Assistance services (AIRE), which will be a single integrated and national service for asylum seekers.

The AIRE service will provide advice and guidance to service users on the asylum process, their rights and signposting different services.

It will also provide asylum seekers with a single point of contact, independent from the accommodation providers and the Home Office, to report issues.

Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said:

The UK has a proud history of providing protection to those who need it and these new contracts will make sure that asylum seekers are treated with dignity and respect in safe, secure and suitable accommodation.

They will deliver compassionate support through a new integrated service and make the asylum system more accessible and easier to navigate.

We consulted extensively with local authorities and NGOs to make sure that the contracts not only protect vulnerable asylum seekers but also deliver value for money for the taxpayer.

The contracts also require accommodation providers to develop and maintain close working relationships with local authorities, and include the need to consult and liaise with them on the location of properties in the area.

The AASC contracts, which will replace the existing COMPASS contracts, have an approximate value of £4 billion and are for 10 years.

After careful consideration of the latest scientific evidence from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), the government confirmed face coverings can help reduce the risk of transmission in some circumstances.

Face coverings can help us protect each other and reduce the spread of the disease if you are suffering from coronavirus but not showing symptoms. People with coronavirus symptoms, as well as members of their household, should continue to follow theadvice to self-isolate.

They may be beneficial in places where it is hard to follow maintain social distancing measures. This applies when using public transport, such as trains, buses and metro systems, or when visiting shops.

They do not need to be worn outdoors, while exercising, in schools, in workplaces such as offices and retail, by those who may find them difficult to wear, such as children under two or primary aged children who cannot use them without assistance, or those who may have problems breathing while wearing a face covering.

The public is being strongly urged not to purchase surgical masks or respirators. These are prioritised for healthcare workers working in more high-risk environments where the risk is greatest.

Instead the public is encouraged to make face coverings at home, using scarves or other textile items that many will already own.Read the guidance on how to wear and make a cloth face covering.

Health Minister Jo Churchill said:

At all times our strategy for keeping the public and the NHS safe during this crisis has been guided by the science.

Today, thanks to the evidence provided by our expert scientists, we are advising people to consider wearing a face covering if they can in enclosed public spaces where social distancing is impossible, for example on public transport or in shops. This may help prevent you spreading the virus to others.

You do not need a clinical mask which is prioritised for our healthcare workers. Instead a face covering is sufficient and we encourage people to make these at home with items they will already own.

Professor Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer said:

Wearing a face covering is an added precaution that may have some benefit in reducing the likelihood that a person with the infection passes it on.

The most effective means of preventing the spread of this virus remains following social distancing rules and washing your hands regularly. It does not remove the need to self-isolate if you have symptoms.

COVID-19 can be spread directly by droplets from coughs, sneezes and speaking. These droplets can also be picked up from surfaces by touch and subsequently from touching the face. That is why hand hygiene is so important in controlling the infection.

Evidence shows a face covering can help in reducing the spread of droplets and therefore potentially infecting others, and could help to reduce the spread of infection as lockdown measures start to be lifted. It is important people refrain from touching their face covering when wearing it, where possible, to avoid hand to mask transmission of the virus.

Government will not be supplying face coverings centrally as at home items and fabrics readily available on the market can be used, but it is important to wash them after every use.

Research from the WHO showed that where masks were recommended for prolonged periods of time, some wearers failed to maintain good handwashing practices or follow social distancing policies, putting others at risk. As England has demonstrated strong adherence to social distancing, the government is confident face coverings can be recommended as an added precaution in certain environments rather than an essential part of social distancing policies.

For  workers in various sectors, or in public transport, the government is advising they continue to follow the advice of their employers and make sensible workplace adjustments. Further guidance on safer workplaces and on transport will be published shortly.

Government has produced guidance for employees and in it they emphasise and reassure employers that for the majority the most effective way they can ensure that their employees are safe at work is to make sensible workplace adjustments, including erecting perspex screens which many supermarkets have already introduced.

There are 10 IFCAs around the English coastline and they are responsible for sustainably managing sea fisheries within 6 nautical miles from shore. They have the power to make byelaws to protect resources and the environment in their area as well as also enforcing national and European fisheries legislation.

IFCAs are either committees or joint committees of the local authorities that fall within an IFC district. They are tasked with sustainably managing inshore sea fisheries resources in their local area. They are made up of representatives from local councils along with people from across the different sectors that use or are knowledgeable about the inshore marine area, such as commercial and recreational fishermen, environmental groups and marine researchers, who offer their time voluntarily.

The Marine Management Organisation, Environment Agency and Natural England also each has a statutory seat on the IFCA. Through their local management and funding structures, IFCAs help put local councils, communities and businesses, and individual citizens in the driving seat, allowing them to play a bigger part in the protection and enhancement of their inshore marine environment.",Recruitment of individuals to IFCA membership,Institutional,Other,id25_311

In line with the recommendation from the independent Climate Change Committee, this sixth Carbon Budget limits the volume of greenhouse gases emitted over a 5-year period from 2033 to 2037, taking the UK more than three-quarters of the way to reaching net zero by 2050. The Carbon Budget will ensure Britain remains on track to end its contribution to climate change while remaining consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goal to limit global warming to well below 2°C and pursue efforts towards 1.5°C.

For the first time, this Carbon Budget will incorporate the UK’s share of international aviation and shipping emissions – an important part of the government’s decarbonisation efforts that will allow for these emissions to be accounted for consistently.

This comes ahead of Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressing the opening session of the US Leaders’ Summit on Climate, hosted by President Biden on Earth Day (22 April). The Prime Minister will urge countries to raise ambition on tackling climate change and join the UK in setting stretching targets for reducing emissions by 2030 to align with net zero.

The government is already working towards its commitment to reduce emissions in 2030 by at least 68% compared to 1990 levels through the UK’s latest Nationally Determined Contribution - the highest reduction target made by a major economy to date. Today’s world-leading announcement builds on this goal to achieve a 78% reduction by 2035.

The new target will become enshrined in law by the end of June 2021, with legislation setting out the UK government’s commitments laid in Parliament tomorrow (Wednesday 21 April).

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:

We want to continue to raise the bar on tackling climate change, and that’s why we’re setting the most ambitious target to cut emissions in the world.

The UK will be home to pioneering businesses, new technologies and green innovation as we make progress to net zero emissions, laying the foundations for decades of economic growth in a way that creates thousands of jobs.

We want to see world leaders follow our lead and match our ambition in the run up to the crucial climate summitCOP26, as we will only build back greener and protect our planet if we come together to take action.

Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said:

The UK is leading the world in tackling climate change and today’s announcement means our low carbon future is now in sight. The targets we’ve set ourselves in the sixth Carbon Budget will see us go further and faster than any other major economy to achieve a completely carbon neutral future.

This latest target shows the world that the UK is serious about protecting the health of our planet, while also seizing the new economic opportunities it will bring and capitalising on green technologies – yet another step as we build back greener from the pandemic and we lead the world towards a cleaner, more prosperous future for this generation and those to come.

The UK over-achieved against its first and second Carbon Budgets and is on track to outperform the third Carbon Budget which ends in 2022. This is due to significant cuts in greenhouse gases across the economy and industry, with the UK bringing emissions down 44% overall between 1990 and 2019, and two-thirds in the power sector.

Moreover, the UK continues to break records in renewable electricity generation, which has more than quadrupled since 2010 while low carbon electricity overall now gives us over 50% of our total generation.

Prior to enshrining its net zero commitment in law, the UK had a target of reducing emissions by 80% by 2050 – through today’s sixth Carbon Budget announcement, the government is aiming to achieve almost the same level 15 years earlier.

Through its presidency of the crucial UN climate summit,COP26, which will take place in Glasgow later this year, the UK is urging countries and companies around the world to join the UK in delivering net zero globally by the middle of the century and set ambitious targets for cutting emissions by 2030.

COP26President-Designate Alok Sharma, said:

This hugely positive step forward for the UK sets a gold standard for ambitious Paris-aligned action that I urge others to keep pace with ahead ofCOP26in Glasgow later this year. We must collectively keep 1.5 degrees of warming in reach and the next decade is the most critical period for us to change the perilous course we are currently on.

Long term targets must be backed up with credible delivery plans and setting this net zero focused sixth Carbon Budget builds on the world leading legal framework in our Climate Change Act. If we are to tackle the climate crisis and safeguard lives, livelihoods and nature for future generations, others must follow the UK’s example.

The government has already laid the groundwork to end the UK’s contribution to climate change by 2050, starting with ambitious strategies that support polluting industries to decarbonise while growing the economy and creating new, long-term green jobs.

This includes the publication of theIndustrial Decarbonisation Strategy, an ambitious blueprint for the world’s first low carbon industrial sector, slashing emissions by two-thirds in just 15 years, as well as over £1 billion government funding to cut emissions from industry, schools and hospitals.

Further, the UK is the first G7 country to agree a landmarkNorth Sea Transition Dealto support the oil and gas industry’s transition to clean, green energy while supporting 40,000 jobs. Through the deal, the sector has committed to cut emissions by 50% by 2030, while the government, sector and trade unions will work together over the next decade and beyond to deliver the skills, innovation and new infrastructure required to decarbonise North Sea production.

Everyone needs to play a role in tackling climate change and bringing businesses and the public along is vital to reach the UK’s climate change goals. Ahead ofCOP26, the government launched the campaign,Together For Our Planet, calling on businesses, civil society groups, schools and the British public to take action on climate change. This UK-wide initiative contributed tolast month’s milestoneachievement of securing pledges from a third of the UK’s largest businesses to eliminate their contribution to climate change by 2050.

Each of these leading measures to tackle climate change, alongside the Prime Minister’s10 Point Plan for a green industrial revolutionand the government’sEnergy White Paper, will help the UK’s trajectory towards meeting the new sixth Carbon Budget.

The government will look to meet this reduction target through investing and capitalising on new green technologies and innovation, whilst maintaining people’s freedom of choice, including on their diet. That is why the government’s sixth Carbon Budget of 78% is based on its own analysis and does not follow each of the Climate Change Committee’s specific policy recommendations.

The UK is bringing forward bold blueprints setting out its own vision for transitioning to a net zero economy and how the government can support the public in transitioning to low carbon technologies, including publishing the Heating and Building Strategy and Transport Decarbonisation Plan later this Spring.

The cross-government Net Zero Strategy will also be published ahead ofCOP26, with Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng currently commissioning work across Whitehall to help inform the ambitious plans across key sectors of the economy.

Moreover, government analysis finds that costs of action on climate change are outweighed by the significant benefits – reducing polluting emissions, as well as bringing fuel savings, improvements to air quality and enhancing biodiversity. The government expects the costs of meeting net zero to continue to fall as green technology advances, industries decarbonise and private sector investment grows.

Reaching net zero will also be essential to sustainable long-term growth and therefore the health of public finances, as well as open up new opportunities for the UK economy, jobs and trade – and the government’s ambitious proposals are essential to seizing these opportunities.

HM Treasury will publish its Net Zero Review in the coming months setting out how government plans to maximise economic growth opportunities from the net zero transition while ensuring contributions are fair between consumers, businesses and the British taxpayer.

Chairman of the Committee on Climate Change Lord Deben said:

The UK’s sixth Carbon Budget is the product of the most comprehensive examination ever undertaken of the
path to a fully decarbonised economy. I am delighted that the government has accepted my Committee’s recommendations in full.

CBI Chief Economist Rain Newton-Smith said:

Setting the sixth Carbon Budget in line with the Climate Change Committee recommendations puts the UK on a credible path to achieve its net zero emissions target.

AsCOP26hosts, the UK government is leading by example by setting this stretching target. Business stands ready to deliver with the latest low-carbon technologies and innovations that are driving emissions down every year. By tackling this together, we can reap the benefits of transition to a low-carbon economy.

The target emphasises the importance of the 2020s as a decade of delivery on our climate ambitions, and urgent action is needed now to make this a reality.

Executive Director of Green Alliance Shaun Spiers said:

By accepting the Climate Change Committee’s recommendations for the sixth Carbon Budget, the government has sent out a resounding message, domestically and internationally, that the UK is taking its net zero emissions target seriously. The inclusion of international aviation and shipping is particularly important, showing climate leadership in the year we are hosting the Glasgow climate summit. What we need now is to ensure there is no gap between ambition and policy, so the UK has the right tools in its armoury to meet these targets.

Executive Director of the Aldersgate Group Nick Molho said:

The government should be commended for adopting the ambitious and evidence-based recommendations from the Climate Change Committee for the sixth Carbon Budget. The emission cuts set out in the Budget represent essential next steps the UK needs to take to ensure a credible, cost-effective, and timely pathway to net zero emissions by 2050. The inclusion of the UK’s share of international aviation and shipping emissions is a particularly welcome addition and will help to accelerate the development of sector-specific decarbonisation plans.

Focus must now turn to strengthening the UK’s policy framework to meet this new target, by putting in place a detailed and cross-departmental net zero strategy that will drive private investment in low carbon goods and services, supply chains, jobs and skills.

The UK is the first country to enter legally binding long-term carbon budgets into legislation, first introduced as part of the 2008 Climate Change Act. Since then, 5 carbon budgets have been put into law putting the UK on track to meet our ambitious goal to eliminate our contribution to climate change by 2050 and achieve net zero emissions.",Sixth Carbon Budget,Legislative,,id25_313
314,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-publishes-final-energy-market-reforms,Press release,CMA publishes final energy market reforms,The CMA has concluded its energy market investigation setting out a wide range of reforms to modernise the market for the benefit of customers.,Competition and Markets Authority,24 June 2016,"Over 30 measures will be brought in after the most comprehensive investigation into the energy market since privatisation. These will drive down costs by increasing competition between suppliers and helping more customers switch to better deals, whilst protecting those less able to benefit from competition. They will also bring in technical and regulatory changes to modernise the market and ensure it works in consumers’ interests.

TheCMAhas today published ashort overviewof its investigation,a summary of the report(PDF,1.12 MB,82 pages)itself and a range ofother materialsfor  consumers and businesses together with its final report.

The investigation has found that 70% of domestic customers of the 6 largest energy firms are still on an expensive ‘default’ standard variable tariff. As these customers could potentially save over £300 by switching to a cheaper deal, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will be enabling more of them to take advantage. TheCMAhas found that customers have been paying £1.4 billion a year more than they would in a fully competitive market.

Suppliers will be ordered to give Ofgem details of all customers who have been on their default tariff for more than 3 years, which will be put on a secure database to allow rival suppliers to contact customers by letter and offer cheaper and easy-to-access deals based on their actual energy usage. Ofgem will control access to the database and carry out testing on the frequency and form of communications, to ensure it is effective in helping customers move on to better deals. Customers can opt out at any time if they wish.

The options to switch are far more limited for the 4 million households on prepayment meters. For these customers, a transitional price cap will be introduced which will reduce bills by around £300 million a year. The cheapest tariffs for such customers are currently £260 to £320 a year more expensive than those available for direct debit customers. The price cap will remain in place until the introduction of smart meters removes the limitations on such customers accessing better deals.

TheCMAis also introducing a range of measures to revitalise competition and reduce the costs borne by customers. These include pressing ahead with reforming outdated systems for measuring and charging energy that distort competition between suppliers, reducing the costs of transmitting electricity and using competition to help ensure that financial support for low carbon generation is allocated at the lowest cost to customers. Price comparison websites (PCWs) will also be enabled to play a more active role in helping customers find the best offers for them and given access to meter data which will enable customers to search instantly for deals.

The measures will also tackle specific issues faced by microbusinesses (those that employ fewer than 10 people) – 45% of which are on default tariffs. Suppliers will now be required to publish their prices for such customers and will no longer be able to lock them into expensive ‘rollover’ contracts.

Ofgem will also be given much greater influence over the detailed codes that govern the working of the market – and which currently give undue influence to established industry participants over decisions that affect competition and consumers – and more powers to enable it to scrutinise the performance of the market and suppliers as well as the impact of policy.

Roger Witcomb, Chairman of the energy market investigation, said:

Competition is working well for some customers in this market – but nowhere near enough of them. Our measures will help more customers get a better deal and put in place a modernised energy market equipped for the future.

With far too many customers paying hundreds of pounds more than they need to, they will be alerted to the better value deals that are out there and it will be easier for them to identify a good deal and switch to it. Those that can help with this process, like price comparison websites, will be given the ability to play a more active role. In other markets, they’ve played a big part in driving down prices, increasing switching and enabling suppliers of all sizes to reach customers and, freed up, they can do the same here.

More active customers will not only save themselves money but keep suppliers on their toes, addressing many of the problems that we’ve identified. There are promising signs in this market with smaller suppliers getting more of a foothold and making it easier for customers to get involved will push things more quickly in the right direction.

For those customers on prepayment meters, whose options to switch are far more limited, we’ll cap prices until the time that they too can benefit from competition.

As well as helping customers switch, there are many other things that need to be done to make this market work better over the coming years and address all those elements that contribute to the final bill for customers. Modernising the market will equip it to meet future challenges and allow it to take full advantage of the forthcoming technological advances, such as smart meters, which have the potential to transform the way we use energy.

As part of this, we’re going to strengthen the ability of Ofgem to push through change, to keep the market and suppliers under the microscope and to scrutinise government policies. With climate change and energy policies having an increasingly large effect on bills, it’s essential that decisions, particularly on support for new forms of generation, are made – and seen to be made – in the best interests of customers.

We believe our measures alongside other future developments will mean energy customers see real improvements over the years ahead.

The changes will be accomplished via a combination ofCMAOrders and recommendations to Ofgem and government. TheCMAwill shortly publish a timetable setting out this remedies implementation process over the next 6 months. All information published in relation to the investigation (including the full report and appendices later today) is available on theenergy market investigation case page.","Ofgem will control access to the database and carry out testing on the frequency and form of communications, to ensure it is effective in helping customers move on to better deals.

315,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-framework-to-support-trainee-and-early-career-teachers,Press release,New framework to support trainee and early career teachers,The Department for Education has today (30 January) announced a new framework which will help ensure high quality teaching and improve pupil outcomes.,Department for Education and The Rt Hon Damian Hinds MP,30 January 2024,"The Department for Education has today (30 January) announced a new framework which will help ensure high quality teaching and improve pupil outcomes.

The new initial teacher training and early career framework (ITTECF) combines and updates theinitial teacher training core content framework(CCF) and theearly career framework(ECF). It will ensure that all new teachers receive three or more years of training underpinned by the best available evidence.

The frameworks were designed to help trainee and early career teachers succeed at the start of their teaching careers and combining them will mean teachers will get a more joined up development journey beyond initial training into the early years of their career.

Schools Minister Damian Hinds said:

Great teaching is key to securing academic success and improving pupil outcomes, which is why it is so important we continue to support teachers with high-quality, evidence-based training.

Today, we have announced a new combined framework to provide trainee and early career teachers with the knowledge and skills they need in those crucial first years in the classroom.

It’s thanks to the hard work of teachers and leaders that education standards have risen significantly since 2010. That is why we will continue to invest in competitive pay and high-quality training, improving teacher wellbeing and easing workload pressures.

Working with experts across the education sector, the framework has been updated to ensure it’s based on the latest evidence, including new and updated content on how teachers should support pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), high quality oral language, and early cognitive development and children’s mental health.

Later this year, the Department for Education will be procuring updated training programmes for early career teachers (ECTs) based on this new framework. They will be designed after an evaluation of the national ECF reforms since September 2021.

The updated programmes, to be rolled out from September 2025, will be better designed to take ECTs’ learning from initial teacher training into account, provide more tailoring based on their level of development, subject and context, and streamline the training and support for mentors so they can better focus on supporting their ECTs.

The framework is a central part of the government’s teacherrecruitment and retention strategyand is supported by the £130 million invested annually into the ECF.

The reforms to support trainees and ECTs builds on the government’s action to boost teacher recruitment, with £196 million invested this academic year to fund scholarships, bursaries and salary grants to help thousands of candidates through their initial teacher training.

Margaret Mulholland, ASCL SEN & Inclusion Policy Specialist said:

We must equip new teachers with the confidence and competence to know they can support every child. Whilst there are no ‘quick fixes’ for teachers or children, an Initial Teacher Training and Early Career Framework that gives more specific focus to developing the knowledge and skills to support pupils that need the most help is welcomed.

Professor Becky Francis, CEO of the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF), said:

Like all great professions, teaching deserves to be built upon a core body of knowledge and skills that describe best practice and are drawn from robust research. By setting out what trainee and early career teachers should be entitled to know and do, today’s updated framework is an important step to realising this.

By independently assessing and endorsing the framework, we’ve made sure the claims it makes accurately reflect the evidence from which they were drawn. Our hope is that providers will be able to translate the framework into practically relevant programmes, balancing the need to cover core content alongside the holistic needs of their participants.

Last year, the government delivered on the manifesto commitment to give every new teacher a starting salary of at least £30,000 – alongside the highest pay award for teachers in over 30 years.

In strengthening the focus on helping teachers to support children and young people with SEND, we are building on wider government reform through theSEND and AP improvement plan, which outlines plans to reform the system, ensuring every child has access to a high-quality, fulfilling education.

The SEND system is underpinned by increased investment in the high needs budget, which will have risen by over 60 percent since 2019 to 2020 to over £10.5 billion in 2024 to 2025.

Supporting teachers’ development will continue to improve pupils’ outcomes. With thanks to the hard work of teachers already, standards of education have risen sharply since 2010, with 89 percent of school rated good or outstanding by Ofsted, up from just 68 percent in 2010.

Also, pupils in England have risen up the international rankings for maths, placing England as one of the top performing countries in the western world.

This built on existing international success, with England coming fourth for primary reading proficiency, out of 43 countries that tested children of the same age in the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study.

The prosecution was brought after the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) identified a discrepancy in the information supplied in the vessel’s fishing logbook when compared with the data returned from the vessel’s satellite monitoring system. The court was told that the discrepancy would have resulted in an underestimation of the number of days the vessel had spent at sea, which are limited under the Western Waters Days at Sea Scheme.

The scheme applies to UK fishing vessels of 15 metres and over in length fishing for either king scallops (Pecten maximus) or queen scallops (Aequipecten opercularis) in ICES Area VII and limits the number of days such vessels may spend at sea for each 3-month period.

At an earlier hearing the defendants pleaded guilty to 4 offences of submitting inaccurate entries for the times of departure and return to port on the electronic logbook.

Skipper Stephen Trust was fined £1,500 for each of 3 offences and ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge plus £4,997 contribution to prosecution costs. Skipper Mark Bolton was fined £1,000 for 1 offence and ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge plus £1,670 contribution to prosecution costs. Trust Trawlers, the owners of the vessel, were fined £1,000 for each of the 4 offences and ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge.

The total fines and costs imposed by the court were £16,467.

MMO recognises that the vast majority of the fishing industry is compliant with the rules that govern its commercial activities. We aim to encourage compliance with fisheries legislation through education, advice and guidance to the industry wherever possible.

The deadline for all new Service personnel registrations and changes to existing details is 14 April 2011.

Individuals may choose to register to vote in one of three ways:

• As a Service Voter - this option is open to all personnel (including spouses or civil partners) but particularly suitable for personnel posted overseas or likely to be posted abroad in the near future. Following the introduction of the Service Voters’ Registration Period Order 2010, Service Registration now lasts for five years. Those who register as Ordinary Voters or Overseas Voters will still have to renew their registration every year.

• As an Ordinary Voter - personnel based in the UK can register in the same way as ordinary electors by filling in and returning the annual canvass voter registration form. Ordinary Voters need to re-register annually.

• As an Overseas Voter - although registering as a Service Voter is the recommended option.

Service personnel and their spouses/civil partners who are overseas or away from their UK residence during an election may elect to vote either by post or proxy, whether they have chosen to register as Ordinary, Service or Overseas Voters. Voting by proxy is still the best option for those serving overseas.

For the 5 May elections and the referendum a similar initiative to that which ran for the elections in 2010 will be put in place to support the participation in voting for Service personnel in Afghanistan.

The Government has asked the Electoral Commission to produce special forms for military personnel, both those going out to Afghanistan and those already there, to fill out and register to vote.

The Ministry of Defence undertakes targeted activity to encourage troops to register to vote by proxy before they leave the UK and each person arriving in Afghanistan is briefed on the initiative.

Troops who fill out the form and request a postal vote are sent ballot forms via the British Forces Post Office (BFPO) and existing supply routes.

Once completed by the voters, the ballot papers will be returned to the UK and distributed to Returning Officers using a network of BFPO, Royal Mail and local authority support put in place for the initiative.

Returning Officers will be asked to prioritise all postal ballot packs heading for BFPO addresses, and those bound for Afghanistan will be transported there using existing logistics, to facilitate Service personnel participation.

Mark Harper, Minister for Political and Constitutional Reform, said:

The brave men and women in Afghanistan are fighting to defend democracy, so it seems only right that we make it as easy as possible for them to take part in the referendum on the voting system and their own elections at home.

The medic, whose job is to provide emergency medical care to soldiers injured in action, ended up having to talk two members of her company through how to treat her despite being in a lot of pain and losing blood.

But, after several months of treatment and physiotherapy sessions at Headley Court Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre, she eventually regained her full fitness and was able to throw away her crutches. At Easter she returned to her full time regimental duties in Germany.

As soon as she was back, Private Smith volunteered to play for 2 Medical Regiment’s netball team, and, despite finishing as runners up to 1 Logistics Support Regiment in the recent inter unit competition, will accompany her team to compete in the overall Army Championships in the UK.

Private Smith said:

I’m disappointed we lost in the final but it was good being part of this competition and coming back to my duties with the Regiment.

I have worked hard to get to this point doing a lot of training and physio, but it’s been worth it.

I always intended to come back and get involved in sports again after my injury, it’s taken a long time and I had to go through a lot of tests to see if I was ready – but I’m now hoping that I will be able to return to Afghanistan next year.

We did well to get to the final, all the girls should really be happy with themselves – and now we can look forward to competing in the Army wide championships. I’ll definitely be going there – it’s good to get back into the swing of things and I am delighted that I can represent my regiment in competitions like this. My next aim is to go further and deploy again.

Back in November 2009, Private Smith, along with her fellow soldiers of 2 Medical Regiment, received her Afghan Campaign medal. Speaking at the time about when she talked the two soldiers from the Welsh Guards Fire Support Group through how to treat her, she said:

Looking back it was a surreal situation. They saved my life; they were not trained medics but suddenly found themselves doing something completely different from their normal duties, but they did really well in what was an extremely difficult situation. My training really kicked in – I had to stay calm to help them help me.

Speaking after the netball final, team captain and fellow medic Captain Olivia Allenby paid tribute to Private Smith’s strength and determination in returning after her injury:

It’s just amazing to have her back. We were in Afghanistan together – I have known her for a long time and it’s a mark of the girl that she is – stubborn and determined – that she has made such a full and successful recovery.

2 Medical Regiment deployed to Afghanistan on Op HERRICK 10 for six months in the spring of 2009 in support of 19 Light Brigade. Their main focus was ensuring that all the battle groups and standalone units had sufficient medical cover for the various operations, and to provide support to the Brigades main mission, which was to establish security across the whole of Helmand in the build up to the Afghanistan Presidential Elections on 20 July 2009.",Physiotherapy sessions and return to full time regimental duties,Welfare,,id25_319

Corporal Lindsey Allan from the RAF Regiment’s 4 Force Protection Wing and Corporal Steven Evans from the RAF Regiment Training Wing performed a fast-rope drop from the aircraft to pass two arrows to Corporal Shaun Gibson who was waiting at the base of The Mound.

Corporal Gibson then delivered the arrows to Mr Hamilton, a member of the Paralympic Archery Team, who fired them at a target which revealed the London 2012 Paralympic official logo - the Agitos.

The unveiling of the Agitos climaxed in pyrotechnics and coloured smoke to mark the beginning of the Paralympic Games in a week’s time.

Corporal Allan said:

It was an amazing experience and I am very proud to have represented the Royal Air Force Regiment at this ceremony.

Officer Commanding C Flight, 33 Squadron, at RAF Benson, Squadron Leader Stewart Staudinger, said:

It really is humbling to play a part in the Edinburgh Ceremony, and the Royal Air Force’s motto of ‘Per Ardua ad Astra’ [‘Through adversity to the stars’] shows that the men and women of the Royal Air Force share the same ethos as the men and women who will be performing at the Paralympics. We are proud to be associated with them.

The Puma Force routinely practises its fast-roping role to enable it to quickly insert troops into hazardous areas or into sites where a conventional helicopter landing is not possible.

The RAF is making preparations for the arrival of the upgraded Puma Mk2 which is due to enter service in 2013 and will see the Puma receive significantly upgraded engines and avionics that will allow it to enhance its capability - particularly in demanding hot and high conditions - and provide many more years of service in the RAF.

Elsewhere, the Paralympic Torch Relay began as four ‘National Flames’ were lit at the highest peaks of the four home nations: Scafell Pike (England), Snowdon (Wales), Slieve Donard (Northern Ireland) and Ben Nevis (Scotland). The Flames will now make their way to their final destination - the Olympic Stadium in London.

It is designed to enhance anti-submarine warfare capability in warm water environments and promote interoperability between ships and aircraft from a variety of nations.

The centerpiece of the ‘cat and mouse style’ exercise was Trafalgar Class submarine HMS Tireless playing the role of the ‘mouse’, while the duties of the ‘cat’ were shared between the Australian frigate HMAS Melbourne and the French frigate FS Dupleix. Meanwhile Merlin helicopters from 820 Naval Air Squadron and US P-3 Orion maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft acted as ‘eyes in the sky’.

HMS Tireless and HMAS Melbourne also exchanged key personnel during the exercise in order to share skills and experience.

A UKMCC spokesperson said:

The number of navies building and operating submarines continues to grow. It is therefore important that the Royal Navy retains its position at the forefront of anti-submarine warfare, a skill easy to lose but difficult to regain. The presence of a large number of coalition navies in this region provides the ideal opportunity to train together.

Commodore Tim Fraser, UK Maritime Component Commander, said:

The large proportion of the Royal Navy’s work in this region is of an operational nature, such as conducting anti-piracy patrols and strengthening relations with regional allies. However, it is important that we also run regular exercises such as this in order to maintain and further develop our skills across the full range of capabilities.

The UKMCC controls all Royal Navy warships, aircraft and personnel in the Middle East maritime theatre, which totals over thirteen hundred personnel and more than a dozen vessels. These include frigates undertaking maritime security operations and anti-piracy patrols, mine countermeasures vessels developing warm water mine hunting techniques, and landing ships supporting the training and development of the fledgling Iraqi Navy and the protection of key Iraqi oil platforms.",Regular exercises such as this in order to maintain and further develop our skills across the full range of capabilities.,Administrative,,id25_321

At 22 years old, Argyll is now the oldest frigate in the fleet, but the 11-month, £20m refit at Rosyth ensures she is also the most capable.

Some 300,000 man-hours were spent overhauling existing systems and machinery and fitting new ones: the latest version of the Sea Wolf air defence missile system, a new main gun, a new command system, one new main gas turbine, two generators, and the MOD’s latest e-mail and internet system, DII(F).

The refit was followed by an extensive work-up incorporating sea acceptance trials, operational sea training and new equipment fits, and so HMS Argyll returns to operations ready in all respects.

Having not seen operational service for over two years and with an extensive and at times arduous trials and training process under their belts, the crew is keen to get back to the Royal Navy’s core business as a deployed ship.

HMS Argyll’s Commanding Officer, Commander Paul Stroude, said:

I am delighted to be sailing for operational tasking today and am extremely proud of the hard work, perseverance and sheer determination that the whole ship’s company and supporting agencies have put in to get us to this point.

I have absolutely no doubt that the ship and her crew are ready in all respects to face whatever challenges lies ahead and, importantly, we recognise the sacrifices made by our families as we leave home for what is a substantial period of time.

Whilst deployed, Argyll’s tasking will include protecting vital international sea lanes from the threat of piracy and terrorism, as well as engagement and capacity-building with the UK’s many friends and allies to promote stability across the Middle East region.

The crew will continue their training in the first few weeks of deployment, ensuring the sailors maintain their edge and and are ready to meet any challenges they may face.

The training will include war-fighting using the traditional weapon systems onboard, and drilling her highly-trained board and search team, which includes a section of Royal Marines from the Fleet Protection Group Royal Marines, to counter terrorism and piracy.

Add to that some extensive fire fighting and damage control exercises and you get a team that is ready for anything.","HMS Argyll’s tasking including protecting vital international sea lanes from the threat of piracy and terrorism, as well as engagement and capacity-building with the UK’s many friends and allies to promote stability across the Middle East region.",Other,Market-based,id25_322

The Sports Winter Survival Package will support sports - from national governing bodies through to clubs -  impacted by coronavirus restrictions.

The funding, which will be largely composed of loans, is the most generous of any Government for its domestic sport sector in the world, and will focus on sports severely impacted over the winter.

Support will be provided to rugby union, horse racing, women’s football and the lower tiers of the National League. Rugby League, motorsport, tennis, netball, basketball, ice hockey, badminton and greyhound racing are also in line to benefit.

Preliminary allocations have been made on a needs based assessment process and reflect the submissions made from the individual sports, and the funding process will be overseen by an independent decision-making board and supported by Sport England.

Today’s announcement builds on support the government has already given the sport sector to help it stay afloat during this difficult time. Earlier this year the Government stepped in toprotect rugby league with £16 million in emergency loans, and in Octoberannounced that £100 million would be provided to support council-run leisure centresmost in need. Sport England announced a £220 million emergency fund for grassroots clubs in April.

These interventions were on top of the multi-billion pound package of business support from the Treasury that have enabled many sports clubs and leisure businesses to survive, including the furlough scheme and business interruption loan scheme. Sports have accessed many hundreds of millions of pounds of support through this.

Sports clubs are the beating hearts of their communities, and this £300 million boost will help them survive this difficult winter period.

We promised to stand by sports when we had to postpone fans returning. We are doing just that by delivering another £300 million on top of existing business support schemes.

Britain is a sports powerhouse, and this Government will do everything we can to help our precious sports and clubs make it through covid.

Over the past few weeks we have worked tirelessly with sport governing bodies and clubs across the country to fully assess what support is needed, as a result of the decision to postpone the return of fans.

We know the vast majority of sports - many of which operate on tight financial margins - have been making serious cost reductions, such as locking down grounds, taking up the furlough scheme for many staff and halting excess payments.

Whilst the Government’s overall economic package has provided a significant buffer, it is absolutely right that we now intervene to protect entire sports, and the communities they support, as we navigate this pandemic.

Sport is a key part of our national life, an important contributor to our economy and a key hub within many communities.

Protecting that sporting heritage and supporting as many jobs within the sports sector as possible is an important step in ensuring that our economy can bounce back from the impacts of the covid pandemic. Alongside this financial support, we now need to ensure that fans can return to sports events as soon as it is safe to do so.

These are unprecedented times for our sector, and those sports and leagues that rely so heavily on spectators for their income that have been especially impacted by the pandemic. The role they play in their local communities is vital and this package of support from Government will be hugely welcomed.

Alongside our wider support for grassroots and community sport, Sport England is working very closely with Government colleagues on the design of this fund and we look forward to playing a key role in its successful and swift delivery.

Full details on the Sports Winter Survival Package, including when it will open, eligibility and how to apply, will be announced by Sport England in due course. It is expected that the first tranche of funding will be distributed in the coming weeks.

US Marine Colonel Bradley Weisz, Deputy Chief of IJC Current Operations and shura co-ordinator, said:

We want to ensure that we are doing everything we can to reduce civilian casualties. We need to change the mindset of our troops to the COIN approach of ‘protecting the people’, and the best way to do that is by sharing best practices and improving overall COIN awareness.

The four main discussion topics the participants focused on were training and education, partnering with Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), escalation of force and civilian casualties, and best practices around the Afghanistan theatre of operations.

These discussions were based, in part, on observations brought back by IJC Mobile Training Teams (MTTs) that were sent to gather information on how units handle escalation of force incidents and report on standard operating procedures that are being used to help reduce civilian casualties:

We need to make good decisions to help reduce civilian casualties,” Lieutenant General David Rodriguez, IJC Commander, said. “The MTTs bring back many good lessons of restraint and good decision-making from our young soldiers.

75 per cent of civilian casualties have occurred when we are not partnered, so it’s very important to work with our Afghan partners to solve this problem,” he added.

Some of the observations and recommendations from the discussions included the need to filter information and COIN awareness down to the lowest soldier level; getting real-life examples to the training centres for units to use; sending ANSF partners to help train units prior to deployments; and focusing more on non-kinetic measures.

To help address these recommendations, a COIN working group was established to discuss lessons learned, best practices and initiatives. Additionally, a monthly IJC training and education plan is being established, and consequence-management drills are planned for units down to platoon level:

Overall, the COIN shura was a success in that it brought the people from around the area of responsibility who deal with these issues every day together to talk about ideas and solutions to the problem of civilian casualties,” said Colonel Weisz.

Major Paul ‘Stits’ Stitson, Second-in-Command of 539 ASRM, said:

The Royal Marines have used a variety of boat and air assets, working successfully in support of the Metropolitan Police.

During the exercise we tested and developed responses to potential security threats that may arise during the Games this summer.

The Met’s Assistant Commissioner Chris Allison, National Olympic Security Coordinator, said:

All of our planning is designed to mitigate against potential risks during the summer of 2012, and this is an example of where we will be using specialist military capability to support us. This exercise is not in response to any specific threat, but is part of our planning to pre-deploy certain specialist assets to bolster our operation.

The discovery of the drugs occurred when HMS Westminster’s Merlin helicopter and combined Royal Marines and Royal Navy boarding teams received orders to search for, intercept and board a suspicious vessel.

They did, and found more than 70 bales of pure heroin, weighing more than 180kg (nearly 400lbs), on the dhow; it is estimated that the drugs have a street value of US $22m - almost £14m.

HMS Westminster is operating under the banner of Combined Task Force 150, one of three task forces co-ordinated by the international Combined Maritime Forces, with the aim of defeating terrorism, preventing piracy, stopping the illegal trafficking of people and drugs, and promoting the maritime environment as a safe place for mariners with legitimate business.

Captain Nick Hine, Westminster’s Commanding Officer, said:

This has been a successful day for Westminster and for Combined Maritime Forces.

These smugglers have failed in their quest to make money by bringing misery to those addicted to this harmful substance in the cities around the world.

His ship was directed to seek out the suspicious dhow by the Royal Australian Navy’s Commodore Jonathan Mead, who is in charge of Combined Task Force 150 (CTF 150).

He hailed Westminster’s success as ‘a dark day for terrorists’, and the second major bust by the force in the past few weeks:

We are talking about a street value of approximately $22m and I am quite proud of the fact that CTF 150 has now effected the disposal of these substances and further legitimised the lawful and stable maritime environment we are here to champion,” he added.

The training has seen troops challenged to break out of the Afghanistan mindset and return to their core role of providing engineering support to airborne forces.

This has meant swapping working with vehicles and living in permanent bases to living out of rucksacks and operating with engineering equipment designed to be dropped by parachute and manhandled.

During the exercise, which has taken place across East Anglia, troops polished their infantry skills on the ranges at Thetford and practised their core engineering abilities while living out in the field and marching more than 40 miles (64km) carrying rucksacks weighing up to 110 pounds (50kg).

See the gallery at Related News for more pictures from the exercise.

On Wednesday, 7 March, 51 Parachute Squadron Royal Engineers was at Waterbeach Barracks near Cambridge after an overnight tab - a fast march carrying rucksacks - from Ely.

The sappers built a water point capable of supplying the daily needs of 1,500 people, built a bridge capable of carrying a Challenger 2 main battle tank and repaired simulated bomb damage to an airfield.

Lieutenant Colonel Jason Hones, Commanding Officer of 23 Engineer Regiment (Air Assault), said:

This has been an arduous exercise that has taken my soldiers back to basics and their core role as airborne sappers. All aspects of their combat engineering and soldiering skills have been tested.

The lessons learnt from this exercise will shape how we perform our role within the British Army’s high readiness contingency force.

The Airborne Task Force (ABTF) sees 16 Air Assault Brigade maintain a force ready to deploy anywhere in the world at short notice. 23 Engineer Regiment (Air Assault) provides close combat engineering support to the ABTF, allowing it to fight, move and live.

Sapper Joe Small, who served in Afghanistan last year, said that the exercise had been ‘tough, but a good lesson in a different way of working’:

It’s very different to Afghanistan, where we lived in forward operating bases and went on planned operations. Contingency operations are about living in the field and doing our job as engineers with the kit we can carry ourselves.

Every soldier has shown determination and fortitude and has faced the challenges head on. The granting of the Freedom is a fitting finale to the end of the tour, and we thank the local community for their support.

Following the freedom parade the C-IED Task Force returned to Carver Barracks to receive their Op HERRICK campaign medals.

Previously the Police Service bought in new dogs.

All the puppies are healthy and predicted to survive the precarious early days. Their progress will be monitored anxiously, especially by Sergeant Matt Robertson of the MOD Police Dog Service in Devonport. He said:

This is a first for the police dog unit in Devonport. There have only been two such litters bred especially by and for the MOD Police. The first was a success and was at police headquarters; this is the second and a coup for Devonport.

Willow produced a large litter and luckily they all look healthy so far. Their mother is a little protective as you might expect and so am I, they are a precious new arrival.

This represents the future of the dog service and we are very keen for them to be in service and training to work for their living after 14 to 18 weeks.

He said the dog service usually bought in German Shepherds as new recruits, but they have increasingly become susceptible to health problems which shortened their working lives.

The best way forward to guarantee good quality, healthy dogs, and from an economical point of view, was to remain in-house and switch breed to Belgium Shepherds of the Malinois variety.

332,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/complete-ban-on-evictions-and-additional-protection-for-renters,Press release,Complete ban on evictions and additional protection for renters,Government announces radical package of measures to protect renters and landlords affected by coronavirus.,"Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (2018 to 2021) and The Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP",18 March 2020,"The government has announced a radical package of measures to protect renters and landlords affected by coronavirus. As a result, no renter in either social or private accommodation will be forced out of their home during this difficult time.

Emergency legislation will be taken forward as an urgent priority so that landlords will not be able to start proceedings to evict tenants for at least a 3 month period. As a result of these measures, no renters in private or social accommodation needs to be concerned about the threat of eviction.

Recognising the additional pressures the virus may put on landlords, we have confirmed that the 3 month mortgage payment holiday announced yesterday will be extended to landlords whose tenants are experiencing financial difficulties due to coronavirus. This will alleviate the pressure on landlords, who will be concerned about meeting mortgage payments themselves, and will mean no unnecessary pressure is put on their tenants as a result.

At the end of this period, landlords and tenants will be expected to work together to establish an affordable repayment plan, taking into account tenants’ individual circumstances.

To support this announcement the government has worked with the Master of the Rolls to widen the ‘pre-action protocol’ on possession proceedings, to include private renters and to strengthen its remit. This will support the necessary engagement between landlords and tenants to resolve disputes and landlords will have to reach out to tenants to understand the financial position they are in.

The government will also issue guidance which asks landlords to show compassion and to allow tenants who are affected by this to remain in their homes wherever possible. The National Housing Federation and Local Government Association have welcomed the new support for social renters and made clear that no one should be evicted because of the coronavirus.

This important step on buy to let mortgages ensures parity of support, further to the announcement yesterday that the government made for private mortgage holders.

We are also announcing that those who have benefited from a government backed Help to Buy equity loan will be offered interest payment holidays if they are struggling to pay due to coronavirus.

Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick MP said:

The government is clear – no renter who has lost income due to coronavirus will be forced out of their home, nor will any landlord face unmanageable debts.

These are extraordinary times and renters and landlords alike are of course worried about paying their rent and mortgage. Which is why we are urgently introducing emergency legislation to protect tenants in social and private accommodation from an eviction process being started.

These changes will protect all renters and private landlords ensuring everyone gets the support they need at this very difficult time.

Ben Beadle, Chief Executive of the National Residential Landlords association said:

Landlord groups welcomes government support. We recognise the exceptional circumstances and we will work collaboratively with government to ensure these measures protect both landlords and tenants

Any changes to legislation will only apply to England and Wales, as we share a legal system. We will, of course, be working with the Devolved Administrations across our coronavirus response.

Today the Defence Secretary Philip Hammond will set out what the Army is for.

After the experiences of the past ten years there is unlikely to be much of a national appetite for protracted war. Yes, the United Kingdom faces new threats from terrorism and cyber attack. But in an era where there has been no threat of conventional invasion since the end of the Cold War, some might ask why we can’t shrink our Army by even more than the significant numbers already announced.

Fighting wars through precision attacks from air and sea has obvious political as well as military attractions. And if that won’t work then why not rely on our allies to do the hard yards? Or support a local proxy force to deliver ‘boots on the ground’?

The answer lies in the level of assurance that we as a nation require when our interests are being threatened and we are vulnerable. The world is not going to be any less confrontational just because of its economic plight; in all probability it will be more so.

Some threats we face will come from well outside the military sphere: challenges to our economic interest, to our values and beliefs, to the conditions that underpin stability around the world. Diplomacy and negotiation will always be our first resort. But the credibility of these approaches often depends on the implicit understanding that military options exist - and that, when the preferred means aren’t working, we may need to turn to them.

And that when we do, they must work.

Increasingly that means forming coalitions that include regional partners as well as our traditional allies. They are becoming ever more important in political and military terms, but also to confer international legitimacy on our actions. We should only commit forces when we have a clear understanding of the nuances of the situation at all levels - including the human terrain. Understanding that is critical as both Iraq and Afghanistan have demonstrated. Such a level of clarity is hard to come by.

We have designed Army 2020 against this backdrop. Our future force will be structured around three core purposes. The first is intervention and conventional deterrence; the second is overseas operations in multinational alliances to prevent conflict at source; the third purpose is activity within the UK - partly to make us more responsive to domestic operations such as flood relief and the Olympics and to improve homeland resilience, but primarily to ensure that we can sustain the reformed Army Reserve that will be a key element of our new forces.

The Army Reserve will include armoured forces and light forces, intelligence and surveillance. It will work with the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force as well as government departments and NGOs [non-governmental organisations]. It can be adapted to handle smaller operations, or configured as a full-scale brigade for a sustained period, as we currently operate in Afghanistan. Given warning it will field a division for even larger challenges.

Despite a reduction of 20 per cent in our regular manpower, our future capacity will not be far short of its current level. We have managed this by building a high dependence on the new Army Reserve, and a support network of specialist contractors. This is a groundbreaking change. But I am confident that with imagination and the help of employers and industry - supported by changes to legislation - this will work.

Relocating the Army from Germany calls for some focused spending on new bases - and the sooner we can do this the better. We will have important new equipment, including the excellent capabilities returning from Afghanistan.

But what of our officers and soldiers who are so critical to this venture? They are to be found in the warrior generation that has fought courageously in Iraq and Afghanistan. We need them to soldier on into the new era, and we need people of comparable courage, talent and commitment to join them.

After our departure from Afghanistan in 2014 life in this new Army is going to be different for sure; but it will be just as challenging. So we will look after them and their families. The ongoing redundancy programme is unavoidable. We must do everything possible to support those soldiers making the transition into civilian life. Equally we need to ensure the military continues to attract the best.

Change is always difficult, and for an organisation as mindful of its history as the British Army this is especially so. I am confident that Army 2020 is imaginatively configured and properly resourced to meet the future demands of this uncertain world, manned by soldiers of the highest quality.

Both crews were liberated by Royal Marines boarding teams, with the pirates captured and sent for prosecution in Italy and the Seychelles.

Major Whitmarsh said:

The job satisfaction from this deployment was immense - we went out there to chase down pirates and keep the sea lanes safe and that is exactly what we did.

As part of my job on board RFA Fort Victoria I was in charge of planning the operations against the pirates, so to see it all come together and also see them sent for prosecution was a real highlight.

Major Whitmarsh deployed to the Gulf as part of the task force in September 2011 and within a month was part of an operation to free the crew of an Italian-owned cargo ship - the MV Montecristo - who were being held hostage by pirates.

The crew had managed to lock themselves inside an onboard ‘safe room’ once they realised they were being attacked by pirates, and, despite still having full control of the ship’s main functions, they were effectively trapped inside.

As part of the task force RFA Fort Victoria was charged with helping to free them - and sent in a boarding party of Royal Marines Commandos who quickly stormed the vessel and captured the pirates without a single shot being fired:

It was a completely compliant boarding,” said Major Whitmarsh. “It is always a nerve-wracking moment watching the marines board a ship because you never really know what might await them. In this case the pirates very quickly gave themselves up and were subsequently sent to Italy for prosecution.

Following the incident the task force received notice that the mothership - a captured Pakistani dhow from which the pirates had been launching their operations - was around 30 hours away and travelling at a very slow speed:

We immediately leapt into action and went after them,” said Major Whitmarsh. “They were only doing eight knots [15km/h] so we could chase them down pretty quickly. What amazed us was that they had HMS Somerset on one side of their boat, us behind them, and a Merlin helicopter firing warning shots and still they would not stop.

We gave them every warning we could to let them know we wanted them to surrender - we had tried to radio them, we were physically bearing down on them and our helicopter was firing shots into the water at their bow but they were clearly of the mindset that we would not attempt to board them.

The pirates’ luck did though run out in the end - RFA Fort Victoria ordered her marines to get on board the dhow, which they did, capturing five pirates and rescuing 24 Pakistani crew members. All five pirates were then sent to the Seychelles for prosecution.

The operation was Major Whitmarsh’s first deployment at sea in the ten years since he joined up. Previous deployments have included Northern Ireland, Iraq and two tours of Afganistan:

If I get the chance to go out again I definitely would,” added Major Whitmarsh, who now lives in Selby, North Yorkshire, and had been sent to work with the task force only a month after his wedding.

He joined the Royal Marines in 2001 and was told of his QCVS during a telephone call from his boss:

I was really surprised but proud as well,” he said. “I had no idea it was coming but it is a real honour and the cherry on the cake of a really interesting deployment.

Working alongside the Afghan National Police and in conjunction with official agencies, they are also helping to convince people that the Afghan Government exists to help them and represents the way forward in their country.

In one particular case, troops encountered an elderly woman who had been forced to leave her home due to the rains.

The weight of the water had led to the roof and walls of her compound collapsing. On discovering this - and the fact that her husband and son had previously been killed by insurgents, leaving her the sole carer for her two grandchildren - the soldiers offered immediate assistance.

While neighbours agreed to accommodate the woman and her grandchildren temporarily, the soldiers collected items including blankets and cushions for her and made available a sum of money to enable her to pay local workmen to rebuild her home.

Lieutenant Erik Smith of 2 SCOTS said:

This act of compassion on the part of the troops attracted a lot of attention from the village elders and mullahs. One elder who spoke with the patrol commander offered his gratitude on behalf of the village and promised to say a prayer for ISAF at the evening prayers.

The purpose of the Army presence in the Loy Check area is to prevent insurgent activity creeping back in to what was once a stronghold for them.

Their mission is to disrupt insurgent movement from the north and provide the community with the security it deserves, having now rejected the insurgency.

Lieutenant Smith added:

The platoon have been impressed by how the locals have responded to their recent patrols. Every day the troops encounter locals who are willing to offer help to ISAF by providing information on insurgent activity and identifying potential development projects in the area.

The platoon have made a real impact since their move into Loy Check - progress we are confident will continue when the Afghan National Police eventually move into the checkpoint and assume sole responsibility for security in this area.",Provision of financial assistance and logistical support to local residents.,Welfare,,id25_336

Just last month the insurgency held an iron grip on this community and local people were unwilling to talk to the police for fear of reprisals - but a series of patrols over the last few weeks have established security and given locals the confidence to speak out.

Launching the attack in the early hours of the morning, the joint force discovered five ready-made pressure-plate improvised explosive devices in a completed state ready to be laid.

In addition, they discovered a ‘directional fragmentation charge’, a component designed to explode in a specific direction to cause maximum injury.

Some components were recovered for further analysis while the charges were destroyed in controlled explosions.

Lieutenant Tom Lambert, who was involved in the operation, said:

Two weeks ago, this area was a war zone. Now the people are so confident and on side that they actively helped us and the ANP find an IED factory.

Already 2011 is rapidly becoming a very bad year for the insurgents, but it’s certainly got off to a good start for the people of Babaji.

Captain James Collinge added:

This operation dealt another blow to the insurgency campaign and has taken us another step closer to providing security for local people that the ANP will maintain in the long term.

Ross McAllister, Magnox programme delivery director said: “This is one of the largest decommissioning projects that Berkeley site has seen for several years.  It was originally planned for the 2070’s so it is fantastic to bring that forward by five decades in our aim to deliver our mission better, faster and even safer.

“The blower houses circulated gas through the reactors to transfer heat into 310 tonne boilers to create steam to turn the turbines and generate electricity. The last of the 15 gigantic metal boilers was transported to Sweden for cleaning, smelting and recycling in 2013.

“The buildings will be emptied of the residual metallic low-level waste and undergo a full asbestos clean before being demolished. The work is expected to take eight years to complete and will be another major step forwards in sustainably decommissioning Berkeley site with our supply chain partners.”

Following extensive procurement exercises, Altrad have been awarded a £30.8m contract for the design, asbestos removal, deplant, demolition and construction works in and around the blower houses and will be supported by other Celadon alliance companies including:

Kevin Williamson, Altrad’s General Manager for Magnox, said: “We are delighted to have secured this major decommissioning contract at Berkeley which encompasses the retrieval and cleaning of the primary circuit ductwork and miscellaneous steelwork from the blower houses, prior to their demolition – including the processing of the spring hangers from the lubrication pits, which need to be de-energised and made safe before they can be cleaned.”

Nuclear Decommissioning Authority operating company, Nuclear Waste Services (NWS) were awarded a £13.7m contract to manage 2,400 tonnes of metallic waste. Carly Sutton, WMS Consultant and Magnox Relationship Manager, NWS commented: “Through our metallic waste treatment service and working with our supply chain partner Augean we will establish a waste handling compound at Berkeley to provide a safe and secure undercover area where the metallic waste can be processed before it leaves the site for treatment.

“Removal of legacy metals from the Berkeley blower houses is significant not only in terms of achieving hazard reduction, but also good for environmental performance - as the high-quality steel removed will be treated, recycled and returned to the metal market for reuse.”

Chris Hannon, Augean Head of Radioactive Waste Services, added: “Augean is incredibly excited to be part of one of the largest metallic waste treatment projects in the UK for over a decade.  The metallic waste will be treated at Augean sites in the UK with over 95% of the metal being decontaminated to levels that allow recycling.   We’re working with a number of key subcontractors including NSG Environmental who will be leading the design of the waste handling compound.   This project is a core part of Augean’s strategy to deliver best environmental outcomes for our clients.”",Award of contracts to Altrad and Augean for decommissioning and waste management,Institutional,Market-based,id25_338

An estimated 2,500 people will have the opportunity to retrain and become experts in data science and artificial intelligence (AI), thanks to a £13.5 million investment to fund new degree and Masters conversion courses and scholarships at academic institutions in England over the next three years.

£5 million is also being invested to encourage technology companies to develop cutting-edge solutions, utilisingAIand automation, to improve the quality of online learning for adults. The ground-breaking Adult Learning Technology Innovation Fund, which will be launched in partnership with innovation foundationNesta, will provide funding and expertise to incentivise tech firms to harness new technologies to develop bespoke, flexible, inclusive, and engaging online training opportunities to support more people into skilled employment.

Companies across the tech sector already employ more than 2.1 million people, contribute £184 billion to the economy every year and inward investment to the UKAIsector stood at £1 billion for 2018, which is more than Germany, France, Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland combined.

To further strengthen the sector, Government is investing in data-driven technologies, such as artificial intelligence, through the modern Industrial Strategy, so tech businesses and people with the drive and talent can succeed.

Speaking ahead of his speech at CogX, the Digital Secretary Jeremy Wright said:

The UK has a long standing reputation for innovation, world-leading academic institutions and a business friendly environment and everyone, regardless of their background, should have the opportunity to build a successful career in our world-leading tech sector.

Through these newAIand Data Conversion courses and our modern Industrial Strategy, we are committed to working with the tech sector and academia to develop and maintain the bestAIworkforce in the world.

Business Secretary Greg Clark said:

UK firms continue to build on our heritage as the home of Artificial Intelligence, and through our modern Industrial Strategy we’re investing in that strength to ensure we remain world-leaders in the field and at the very forefront of the latest technologies.

These new retraining opportunities and scholarships will ensure people from all backgrounds have the opportunity to move into new and exciting careers, and to shape this innovative industry for years to come.

On the launch of the new Adult Learning Technology Innovation Fund, Education Secretary Damian Hinds said:

Artificial Intelligence and other new technologies are transforming the way we live and work and have the potential to radically improve online learning and training, so more people can get the skills they need.

We all have busy lives, juggling work and family commitments so online courses are a great way for‎ more people to retrain or upskill and secure a rewarding career. Investing in cutting edge technologies such asAIwill mean we can future proof the online learning experience and ensure it better meets students’ needs.

This is an exceptional opportunity for technology firms to work with Government to put their ideas into action to help develop pioneering online training opportunities for adults.

Applicants to theAIand Data Science Conversion courses can come from any background, including those who have not studiedSTEMor a related discipline before. This could include people returning to work after a career break and looking to retrain in a new profession, under-represented groups in theAIand digital workforce, including women and people from minority ethnic backgrounds, or lower socio-economic backgrounds.

Courses are open to anyone who meets a participating university’s entry requirements. Details of how to apply are available on the universities’ websites. Eligible applicants can apply for a scholarship through their university. Please visit theOffice for Student’s websitefor more information.

Tech Nation statistics published in 2018 revealed only 19 per cent of our tech workforce are women.

Creating a more diverse future workforce will help with the design of new technology, including the fair and accurate development of algorithms, and tackle some of the greatest social challenges of our time - from protecting our environment, to transforming the way we live and work, and saving lives through diagnosing diseases earlier.

The news follows the recently announced multimillion skills package which saw the creation of industry-fundedAIMasters, prestigious Alan Turing InstituteAIresearch fellowships, and 16 dedicated Centres at universities across the country to train 1000 extraAIPhDs.

Confirmation of the new funding comes as Tech Nation opens applications for the first ever AppliedAIgrowth programme. This will giveAIstartups across the UK the opportunity to benefit from meeting with industry leaders and investors in the sector and meet with their peers to develop impactful technology.

Technologies developed under the Adult Learning Technology Innovation Fun will help inform the Government’s National Retraining Scheme. The National Retraining Scheme aims to upskill individuals in the UK most at risk of redundancy with the knowledge they need to progress in work, secure better employment, and redirect their careers.

The  new fund  builds on the work already underway through theGovernment’s Education Technology Strategy, published in April, which includes £10 million investment to support innovation and raise the bar in schools, colleges and universities across England.

Vicki Sellick, Executive Director of Programmes at Nesta said:

In the face of automation, technology in the workplace is often  portrayed as a threat. Yet Nesta’s own research shows technology could be used to inform workers about the skills they will need in a rapidly changing  job market, and deliver flexible, personalised training.

Technology, such asAI, has huge potential to provide insights on local labour markets and give workers appropriate advice, guidance and learning opportunities. We’re delighted to be adding resources from our own endowment to partner with DfE to ensure technology is being used to support workers to upskill and re-skill for the jobs of the future.

Sue Daley, Associate Director, Tech UK, said:

AItechnologies, such as chatbots, offer the opportunity for adult learners to access increasingly personalised information, advice and guidance that fits around their everyday normal life.  techUK seesAIas a power for good in helping adults to keep their skills and knowledge up-to-date.

The funding announced today is a great step forward in making the UK a leader in the creation of innovativeAI-enabled learning products and services.  We look forward to working with government and Nesta to explore together how innovativeAI-driven solutions can be designed, developed and adopted to support adult learners.

The Office for Artificial Intelligence and Government Digital Service have published guidance on the use ofAIin the public sector, to help organisations across the civil service understandAIand how it can be used to solve problems within their departments. The guide features a section onAIethics and safety, informed by detailed guidance produced by The Alan Turing Institute,  and meets government’s ambitions to develop and useAIresponsibly and safely.

To help the UK build a world-class data economy, Government has launched acall for evidenceto help shape the National Data Strategy to make sure the future use of data is ethical and benefits business and wider society. The strategy will aim to unlock the power of data across government and the wider economy, while building peoples’ trust in its use.

The bell was found in more than 2,800 metres of water in the Denmark Strait, where it has lain since Hood was sunk by the German warship Bismarck on 24 May 1941.

Yesterday, Monday 3 September, from a rain-swept flight deck, crew members of the Octopus laid wreaths in memory of the 1,415 members of the naval service who died, including personnel from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Poland.

Mr Allen said:

I was honoured to be involved in this project, and I stand ready to help the Royal Navy try again in the future.

Recovering this bell is a way to commemorate the hundreds of brave sailors who were lost at sea and I want to see it through.

Mr Allen has offered to recover the bell without any cost to a grateful Royal Navy and Ministry of Defence.

The Octopus, which is equipped with a remotely-operated vehicle (ROV), is being supported by Blue Water Recoveries Ltd which specialises in the search for and investigations of shipwrecks.

The recovery is fully supported by the HMS Hood Association whose members include veterans who served in the ship before her final mission in 1941 and relatives of those lost with her.

Association President Rear Admiral Philip Wilcocks, whose uncle was among those who died on board Hood, said:

While hugely challenging conditions have precluded a successful recovery of HMS Hood’s bell on this occasion, the Hood Association continues to hope that another attempt will be made at some stage in the next year or so.

Our objective remains the provision of a unique memorial in the National Museum of the Royal Navy for this iconic warship and her gallant crew.

We are extremely grateful to Paul Allen, to David Mearns [of Blue Water Recoveries Ltd] and for the professionalism of the captain and crew of the Octopus for their outstanding assistance on this occasion.

A Royal Navy spokesman said:

After days of trying to recover the bell of HMS Hood, poor weather and other issues have made it impossible to successfully retrieve the bell on this trip.

We want to thank philanthropist Paul Allen and the HMS Hood Association for all their support and efforts.

The work that was accomplished on this trip has been invaluable and will put us in an even stronger position for a future mission.

We will be co-ordinating with all parties to see if and when we can make another attempt some time in the future.

David Mearns of Blue Water Recoveries Ltd, who first found one of the two ship’s bells in 2001, said:

Despite our limited dive-time we were able to relocate the bell relatively quickly and confirm that the ROV’s manipulator arms were able to physically reach it in order to attach recovery tools.

This information will be vitally important in planning a future recovery attempt. The location of the bell, and decoration on its rim, strongly indicates that it is Hood’s main bell as we had expected and hoped.

The high definition video showed the bell was in excellent condition and thus another year or so on the seabed will cause it no harm.

If recovered, the bell will form a major feature of a new exhibition dedicated to the 20th and 21st century Navy. It is due to open at the National Museum of the Royal Navy at the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard in 2014, which is a fitting location as HMS Hood was based in Portsmouth.

Professor Dominic Tweddle, Director General of the National Museum, said:

I am deeply grateful to Paul Allen, Blue Water Recoveries and the HMS Hood Association for all their hard work and support in attempting to recover the bell.

A place will be reserved in our new galleries dedicated to the 20th and 21st century Navy; a place that we hope to fill in the future when Hood’s bell is successfully recovered.

The wreck of HMS Hood is designated under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 and the recovery of the bell has been licensed by the British Government.",Licensing by the British Government,Legislative,,id25_340

In addition to conducting maritime surveillance in the Weymouth Bay area, 814 Naval Air Squadron crews, known as the ‘Flying Tigers’, will be on call to respond to any incident as directed by Maritime Force Commander Dorset, the Commanding Officer of HMS Bulwark.

The Merlin Mk1 is the world’s most potent submarine-hunting helicopter, using state-of-the-art active sonar and passive sonobuoys, but is equally adept at a broad range of traditional maritime helicopter duties such as sea surveillance, search and rescue, and the transfer of passengers and equipment.

More specialist roles have also been added since the aircraft entered front line service in 2000, most notably maritime sniping, fast-roping, and intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance. This combination of capabilities has made the Merlin Mk1 the aircraft of choice for this particular element of the Fleet Air Arm’s support to the Olympics security plan.

The Commanding Officer of 814 Naval Air Squadron, Commander Christopher Stock, said:

A lot of hard work has gone on behind the scenes by both my engineers and aircrew over many months to ensure aircraft and flying crews are ready for Op Olympics.

The Squadron has been liaising very closely with the police and other agencies, and conducted a comprehensive and dedicated work-up package so that the Flying Tigers can contribute to a safe and secure Olympic and Paralympic Games.

The Merlins will be based out of RNAS Yeovilton for the duration of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and fly to and from HMS Bulwark, which is positioned in Weymouth Bay close to the Olympic Sailing Regatta. The move from Culdrose enables them to utilise the facilities available at the Somerset base and be closer to their operating areas.

1st Battalion The Royal Welsh deployed to Afghanistan in December and returned to their UK base, Dale Barracks in Chester, about five weeks ago, having had a central role in several high profile operations, notably Operation MOSHTARAK.

Soldiers from this battalion made the biggest find of improvised explosive devices ever uncovered by British forces in Afghanistan.

The Queen arrived shortly before midday and was greeted by Major General Roddy Porter, Colonel of the Regiment.

A Drumhead service of Thanksgiving preceded the presentation of Operational Service Medals to the 60 soldiers for whom the battalion’s recent tour was their first, with Her Majesty presenting 16 medals, including to six soldiers wounded during the operational tour.

The service remembered the sacrifices of the wounded soldiers and also remembered Fusilier Jonathan Burgess, the only soldier from the battalion to be killed in action during the tour.

The Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Colonel Nick Lock, then led his battalion on a march past, to cheers and applause from thousands of family members and friends who filled the racecourse stands.

Her Majesty The Queen then met with families and soldiers before an official reception and lunch.

Sergeant James Wilson said:

It is a massive boost for the guys that the Queen came to see us today and present medals.

The tour was quite intense and very challenging. We were working with French, Afghans and Estonians, which brings its own challenges which you have to adapt to.

Lance Corporal Gareth Smith said:

It has been a good day, especially for our families to be able to see us getting medals from the Queen. It is great for morale for the lads and the families.

Earlier, Major General Porter officially launched The Royal Welsh Regimental Association, formed from uniting the Regimental Associations of the antecedent regiments, The Royal Welch Fusiliers and The Royal Regiment of Wales.

Both soldiers have enjoyed careers packed with action in operational theatres all over the world. During his 20-year career, SSgt Smith has deployed on operations in the Falklands, Belize, Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan. SSgt Morrison has served in Ireland, Iraq, Kenya, Canada, Belize, Cyprus, Germany, Denmark, and is now on his third tour of Afghanistan.

Military Stabilisation Support Teams (MSSTs) are made up of regular personnel and reservists from the three Services, and have been working with villagers in the southern Afghan province for nearly four years.

With security improving all the time, the MSSTs help create prosperity by establishing new infrastructure projects. Their aim is to break the insurgents’ sway over the region, and establish enduring solutions – both practical and behavioural – to Helmand’s problems.

In Nahr-e Saraj (North) (NES(N)), the MSST regularly meets with mayors, district governors and community councils to help them reach out to local communities and earmark potential projects to improve daily life. The MSST also provide financial grants for projects and ropes in the expertise of the Royal Engineers for structural and infrastructure advice:

Every day is different,” says SSgt Smith. “We’re always out and about talking to the locals and finding out what infrastructure they need. We work closely with the community elders dealing with issues no matter how big or small.

His mixed-sex military team recruits personnel for their diverse skills, ranging from reconstruction, project management, and agricultural expertise, to project- and site-management. Each village has differing access to schools, clinics, markets, mosques, clean water and food, so the MSST works on a case-by-case basis, with locals prioritising decisions.

The next step is for the MSST to accommodate these needs, instructing contractors, ironing out practical or structural problems, and trying to ease freedom of movement. Ultimately though, it is the locals who have the final say on how they want their communities to look in the future.

SSgt Smith and his team hold shuras - traditional Afghan meetings - to understand the needs of local people:

They’re a lot like village hall meetings,” says SSgt Smith. “We sit down, drink tea and discuss what reconstruction and development projects would best benefit the community. Then, we work with local government officials and Afghan contractors to plan how a project can be turned from an idea into a reality.

The Provisional Reconstruction Team (PRT) decides what projects should be supported, and the MSST advises and mentors local agencies, providing guidance through each phase to help build capability and leave a lasting legacy.

SSgt Smith explains how military engineers are trained from early on in their careers to project manage and supervise build sites. He joined the Army as an apprentice tradesman, and reckons that his lifetime experience is helping the Afghans to build a future:

The Afghan contractors come up with the plan, and we offer advice and guidance if they need it,” says SSgt Smith. “This can range from writing quotes to tendering and agreeing contracts. During the build, we visit the sites to make sure everything is on track and see if any further assistance is required.

Working on the re-development of the Noorzai bazaar, SSgt Smith will witness the construction of a purpose-built market and taxi rank to encourage economic growth outside of the Gereshk city centre. Two wells and a mosque have already been completed, and building work will shortly begin on 880 shops, while a road, footpath, drainage ditch, water tower, and a permanent water supply to local shops, are all in the pipeline.

For SSgt Smith, the highlight of his tour is a project to install 144 solar streetlamps along the Bandi Barq road in NES(N). The lighting will help reassure locals and improve security by deterring insurgents.

SSgt Smith helped to advise the Afghans to tender work to contractors, select the best quote and draw up contracts. This project is about to begin, and is on track to be completed before SSgt Smith finishes his tour:

I’m really looking forward to seeing the Bandi Barq road project completed,” he said. “This has been a great tour, and seeing those lights go on will top it off perfectly.

Coming from a long line of sappers, SSgt Smith recalls how, as a child, he would listen to his dad, Robert, tell him about all the exciting places he’d visited and the projects he’d built during his time as a Royal Engineer.

It inspired me to join the Corps, and now I’m able to tell my own sons, Charlie and Ben, the same stories,” he smiles.

SSgt Morrison is now on his second tour with the MSST, and he has seen it evolve from its junior CIMIC (Civil Military Cooperation) role in Iraq to its current role - working closely with ISAF civilian stabilisation groups and, most importantly, the people of Afghanistan:

Uniform is a double-edged sword,” he says. “It gives us freedom to visit local communities and spread the messages needed to develop projects. However, the uniform can be seen as just another uniformed soldier. That’s why the MSST employs senior ranks specially trained and selected for their communication ability.

Both Staff Sergeants Smith and Morrison find it deeply gratifying to see the MSST development projects, years in the making, come to fruition.

SSgt Morrison says:

One project is the Mayor’s park, created to bring the community together, as well as providing a shaded communal area.

Two years after his first tour, the project that was in its infancy is now another success story for the MSST. Similarly, he describes how a new police station, which was then just blueprint on paper, is now a thriving, manned police station, helping the community to help themselves:

Based on my experience, Gereshk is a real success story as the economical capital of the region,” says SSgt Morrison. “The Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) is working with ISAF to improve trade links to areas such as Sangin and Musa Qaleh. It’s hoped that the people living there will hear of the progress in Gereshk and seek to emulate the same success.

Seeing vast number of trucks come through, laden with vegetables and fruit is a testament to progress made and the opportunities that continue to appear.

Next, SSgt Morrison will work on plans for a business park and a refrigeration and cold storage plant in central Gereshk. This multi-million dollar project will improve local prosperity making it possible to store produce longer and less reliant on imported goods.

Economic prosperity is within reach of local people here,” he says. “The changes I’ve seen over the years have been phenomenal. It’s down to the hard work of our men and women and the most notably the Afghans who are driving the process forward.",Financial Grants for Projects,Welfare,,id25_343

It’s a place where many ISAF [International Security Assistance Force] and Afghan…,Ministry of Defence,7 March 2012,"I visited Sangin today for the last time as Head of the PRT. It’s a place where many ISAF [International Security Assistance Force] and Afghan troops have lost their lives over the years.

When I went for the first time in October 2010 we had to fly in after dark for security reasons. That summer and autumn Royal Marines and US Marines took very heavy casualties. Sangin epitomised the challenges in northern Helmand.

Today, Sangin is a symbol of progress. Last week Afghan officials conducted registration for its first ever local election. Over 3,000 elders took part, which would represent the highest turnout for a local election in Helmand. That included a woman, a widowed ex-Mujahideen fighter - which may not sound a big deal, but in remote, conservative north Helmand is a remarkable development. The election itself in late-March will produce Helmand’s eighth elected local council, further extending the writ of Afghan governance across this province.

Such progress in less than 18 months is a tribute to the courage and sacrifice of British, US and Afghan security forces, and to the leadership of Governor Mangal and District Governor Sharif. On 1 January 2011 Mangal concluded a security accord with Alikozai elders from the Upper Sangin Valley - not the end of hostilities but a vital first step.

By the summer Sangin had an appointed interim council, supported through Afghan systems with PRT funding and technical advice. By the end of the year Afghan experts assessed that the situation was ripe for full elections - following the same path as Marjah in central Helmand 12 months earlier.

Sangin’s story also illustrates the transformational effect of paved roads and the security and freedom of movement they bring. Last autumn Mangal drove from Lashkar Gah to Sangin in 40 minutes on Route 611, newly-constructed with UAE [United Arab Emirates] funds. The Afghan experts who oversaw registration last week returned to the provincial capital by the same route in ordinary civilian vehicles. Suddenly the reach of governance doesn’t depend on ISAF helicopters.

There are still challenges in the north. Late last week seven Afghan soldiers were killed by an IED. But people are signalling clearly their desire for change.

We will continue to support stronger governance and development in the area, from Lashkar Gah and through our civilian District Stabilisation Team on the ground. This month we will let a contract to pave Route 611 north to Kajaki - a joint UK/UAE/US project to secure access to the strategically vital hydropower plant at Kajaki. There’s now a strong Afghan government presence there, following successful security operations last autumn. Northern Helmand is changing fast.

They were treated to music from the Band of HM Royal Marines School of Music, impromptu flypasts from Coastguard, RAF Search and Rescue and Fleet Air Arm helicopters, and even a blast from the fire hose of a tug which was working with the Gosport ferry in the harbour.

The ship’s chaplain, the Reverend Charles Bruzon, led guests and the 240-strong ship’s company through the last formal act of the destroyer’s career (she made her final entry to Portsmouth, flying a long decommissioning pennant, on Monday).

Despite being in service for three decades, it was in the final year of her life that Liverpool truly made her mark; her seven-month mission in support of the free peoples of Libya last year earned her international acclaim.

Rev Bruzon assured those gathered on the jetty:

What this last ship’s company achieved off Libya will endure and live on.

He said Liverpool’s paying off was “almost the end of a human life”, adding:

All of us will treasure the memories of good times, camaraderie and accomplishments. Hold you heads high and be filled with pride.

It fell to 39-year-old Able Seaman Anthony Clarke to lower the White Ensign for the final time, fold it, then present it to his Commanding Officer Commander Colin Williams.

Liverpool is the junior rating’s last ship, and Able Seaman Clarke said:

To haul down the Ensign was a great honour, but also hugely poignant.

Such feelings were echoed by Cdr Williams, who conceded that his “lower lip was trembling” as his flag was lowered:

This is a sad day - not something you would want to happen, but every ship has a life span and HMS Liverpool has served her country and ship’s companies well to the end, and all should be rightly proud to have served in her.

Liverpool is the last of the ‘classic’ 42s and is ready in all respects to hand the baton of air defence on to the new, more capable Type 45 destroyers.

The camaraderie and esprit de corps that has been generated will live on and be the enduring legacy.

With just two weeks to go before the start of the Olympics, Housing Minister Grant Shapps has called on social housing landlords in East London to be extra vigilant and take tough action against tenancy cheats trying to make a fast-buck out of sub-letting their homes.

His call came ahead of the Second Reading of a Government-backed Private Members Bill - introduced by Richard Harrington MP - aimed at tackling the multi-billion pound tenancy fraud scam. Measures include making the sub-letting of social homes a criminal offence for the first time, and forcing profits made from unlawful sub-letting to be paid back to the landlord. A summary of responses to the consultation and the proposed next steps are also published today.

In the meantime, the Minister is calling on all social housing landlords to use their existing powers to their full extent including eviction.

Grant Shapps said:

Sub-letting a much needed social home is not a clever piece of private enterprise in action. Instead it’s a multi-billion pound scam that denies families in need a decent home. That’s why I’m giving my full backing to this Bill.

Anyone in London hoping to profiteer by sub-letting their council house in the coming weeks needs to know that they could lose their tenancies by unlawfully renting out their home.

And if these fraudsters think this wheeze is a gateway to earning thousands in the future, then they also need to know that it may soon become a criminal offence.

The Olympics are a great opportunity for London to welcome the world. They are not an excuse for wide boys to rip off the taxpayer. We won’t allow cheating outside the Olympic Park anymore than it will be allowed within it.

Conservative MP Richard Harrington said:

I join Grant’s call for landlords to be extra vigilant over this Olympics summer. By introducing my Private Members Bill I want to see stronger punishments for those who commit tenancy fraud and introduce effective deterrents. This new legislation will go a long way in tackling this problem in the long term

Estimates suggest that between 50,000 and 160,000 social homes are unlawfully occupied across the country. Even at the lowest estimate to replace the social homes that are being unlawfully occupied - to house those who have effectively been displaced by tenancy fraudsters - would cost several billion pounds.

Mr Shapps said social housing landlords and councils could learn from others taking on tenancy cheats including:

The text of the Bill can be found on the Parliament website at:http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/preventionofsocialhousingfraud.html(external link).

In summary it will, subject to Parliamentary approval, create new criminal offences of unauthorised sub-letting with the prospect of imprisonment on conviction; give local authorities the power to prosecute these new offences both for other local authorities and on behalf of housing associations as well as on their own behalf; provide for unlawful profit orders in both criminal and civil proceedings, which will require the person against whom the order is made to pay to the landlord any profit made from unlawful sub-letting; and, ensure that an assured tenant of a housing association permanently loses their assured status when they sub-let or part with possession of the whole of their property.",Private Members Bill,Legislative,Other,id25_346

£1 million has been set aside for 16 developers to create AI tools to help with marking and generating detailed, tailored feedback for individual students in a fraction of the time, so teachers can focus on delivering brilliant lessons.

It comes immediately after the Prime Minister set out his plan to harness the potential of AI to usher in a decade of national renewal – using AI to drive growth and revolutionise our public services.

Evidence shows that high quality feedback drives pupil performance, but marking is a huge drain on teacher time.

The Prime Minister has today (Monday 13 January 2025) set out his plan to harness the potential of AI to usher in a decade of national renewal – using AI to drive growth and revolutionise our public services.

Each of the tools will be targeted at a specific age and subject, helping teachers with everything from marking handwritten English and modern language work to providing feedback on maps and diagrams drawn by geography students.

With developers estimating some tools could save time spent on formative assessment by up to 50%, this investment means more time for the work teachers got into the profession to deliver – inspiring students to learn.

Whether its deciphering and delivering individual feedback on a pile of handwritten essays at the click of a button or automatically identifying common errors that students made in maths equations to shape the next day’s lesson, the tools retain teacher oversight of the feedback – balancing AI efficiency with crucial teacher expertise and judgement.

Bridget Phillipson, Secretary of State for Education, said:

Through our Plan for Change, we are determined to drive high and rising standards across schools so we can break down the barriers to opportunity. Giving every child a cutting-edge school experience is a crucial part of our mission.

High quality teaching is the single biggest driver of high standards in schools and through harnessing the potential of artificial intelligence we can get teachers at the front of classrooms doing what they do best – teaching.

The prototype AI tools, to be developed by April 2025, will draw on a first-of-its-kind AI store of data to ensure accuracy – so teachers can be confident in the information training the tools. The world-leading content store, backed by £3 million funding from the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, will pool and encode curriculum guidance, lesson plans and anonymised pupil work which will then be used by AI companies to train their tools to generate accurate, high-quality content.

The project is the first of many that will transform how the government uses public sector data – putting the information we hold to work to improve outcomes for people across the country.

Technology Secretary, Peter Kyle said:

AI has the power to transform education by helping teachers focus on what they do best—teaching. This marks a real shift in how we use technology to improve lives and unlock the near-boundless potential of AI for our classrooms.

These 16 UK innovators, including start-ups and universities, will develop cutting-edge AI tools that will drastically reduce the time teachers spend marking homework and assessments, whether it’s geography charts, coding exercises, or written essays.

Through this approach, we’re not only improving education but also ensuring that our public sector services are world-class, tackling inefficiencies, cutting down backlogs, and making AI-driven progress a cornerstone of our Plan for Change.

Almost half of teachers are already using AI to help with their work, according to a survey from TeacherTapp.  However, most AI tools are not specifically trained on the documents that set out how teaching should work in England, and aren’t accurate enough to help teachers with their marking and feedback workload. Training AI tools on the content store can increase feedback accuracy to 92%, up from 67% when no targeted data was provided to a large language model. That means teachers can be assured the tools are safe and reliable for classroom use.

Daniel Appleby is cofounder of Summatic, which will use the funding to develop a tool to transform feedback for maths students in 16-19 education. The platform will assess areas of weakness and create unlimited new questions for ongoing student practice, driving up performance and improving educational outcomes.

He said:

This funding marks a significant milestone in our mission to use AI-enabled technology to deliver more equitable learning outcomes for students across the United Kingdom, whilst alleviating the marking and admin burden faced by teachers.”

‘HomeSwapDirect’ will give tenants who want to move house - to be closer to a new job, their family, or to a property better suited to their needs - greater choice over potential swaps by allowing them to see a much wider selection of properties than ever before.

Until now tenants have been restricted to swapping properties with other tenants in the scheme chosen by their landlord - effectively meaning only a partial swap scheme existed. ‘HomeSwapDirect’ will instead give tenants access to properties nationwide and boost their prospects of moving.

And as the scheme will be online, it will make advertised swaps much more accessible for tenants and the possibility of moving house ‘just a click away’.

Ministers believe that the current system has left tenants facing an uphill battle when they want to swap to a new home further than just down the road, and have often reverted to applying for a transfer to a new or empty property - where they end up pitting themselves against the record numbers of families on social housing waiting lists.

Improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the home swap system is expected to not only bring economic benefit for tenants and their families by putting them in a position to take up more opportunities, but could also help provide overcrowded families with new opportunities to move into a larger home, swapping with other tenants whose children have moved on and now need a smaller property easier to heat and maintain.

So from next April, new requirements will mean that all social housing landlords will have to ensure that they make properties from across the UK available to their tenants looking to swap their home, giving them the opportunity to move anywhere in the UK - including Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

The reforms are part of the measures included in the Localism Bill to give social tenants far greater freedoms and flexibilities and make better use of social housing.

Grant Shapps said:

It’s crazy that some people don’t want council tenants to have the same life opportunities as everyone else. At the moment tenants who live in social homes might be able to move nearby, but there’s almost no chance of a longer-distance move to take up a new job offer or move closer to their family.

I’m not content to restrict opportunities for the eight million social tenants in this country - that’s why we are determined to shake up the lazy consensus that traps people in this system.HomeSwapDirect will give tenants access to a wider range of properties than ever before, and the chance to move anywhere in the country.

Instead of confining people wanting to move to the back of the queue, it will put their future in their hands, giving them the power to arrange their own home swaps and make the most of every opportunity.

Scotland’s Housing and Transport Minister Keith Brown, said:

I welcome the launch of theHomeSwapDirect.“The scheme will give tenants in Scotland more choice and options by making it easier for them to see details of mutual exchange matches with information on all potential swap partners, throughout the UK.

Two of the providers presently operate in Scotland and have confirmed that any Scottish tenants using their sites will be able to benefit from the national scheme immediately and will have the same experience as tenants in all parts of the UK.

Michelle Reid, CEO of the Tenant Participation Advisory Service (TPAS), and Michael Gelling, Chairperson of the Tenants’ and Residents’ Organisation of England (TAROE) said:

We know many of our tenant members welcome the launch ofHomeSwapDirect, as it will make it much easier for them to move to a social home that better suits their needs. For a long time, our tenant members have been asking for it to be made easier for them to move around the country and this scheme will now allow them to do that.

Martha Lane Fox, the UK’s Digital Champion, said:

HomeSwapDirect is a great example of how digital services can benefit tenants and landlords. Inspiring and supporting tenants to go online and access digital services will increase not only the choice and control they can exercise over where they live, but also their opportunities for education, employment and wellbeing.

Wales Housing, Regeneration and Heritage Minister Huw Lewis said:

HomeSwapDirect will offer tenants more choice on where they live, improving their chances of finding homes to meet their needs.

I would encourage all landlords who are not already subscribing to a mutual exchange service that participates in this service to consider doing so to ensure that all Welsh tenants can share in its benefits.

The Secretary of State also revealed new austerity actions, in the form of a series of simple measures, his department is taking to cut waste and bring spending down. These cost saving measures are part of identified £780m savings across the CLG budget for 2010-11.

The money saving ideas, submitted by staff, include:

Eric Pickles said:

Being open about how taxpayers’ money is spent will push central and local government into rooting out waste and duplication. That’s why we’re throwing open the shutters and bringing the full glare of the public’s eye onto spending.

This new transparent era means a new way of thinking for councils but I’m showing them it’s possible by publishing more of my department’s spending online. I can’t expect councils to cut waste if we don’t get our own house in order. Today I’m implementing the best austerity ideas from CLG staff from cutting catering, to only using second-class stamps to more double-sided printing. These show there are thriftier and smarter ways to use taxpayers’ money in the future.

The whole country has to play its part as we tackle a mountain of inherited debt. By publishing this data we invite an army of armchair auditors to scrutinise where their money goes and make sure it is spent on the right priorities. I want town halls to do the same so the public have local spending at their fingertips.

Departmental spending has also been published today for 2008/09 for over £500 and for spending over £1000 for Arms Length Bodies (ALBs). Last month spending details over £500 for 2009/10 were published.

In addition central government departments and ALBs are expanding the data made available relating to expenditure in local areas through a free to use website.

The public can now find datasets on local spending by searching for local-spend-data on government’s central data portal data.gov.uk. The data now available for 2007/08 and 2008/09 includes expenditure on benefits, breakdown of revenue expenditure by Primary Care Trusts, Strategic Health Authorities and NHS trusts and grants by Home Office to Drug Action Teams with more datasets available over the coming weeks.

All of the local spending data has been tagged with local-spend-data. The Cabinet Office have announced that anyone can make suggestions about which datasets they wish to see be made public by going towww.data.gov.uk/data(external link) and clicking on the ‘request new data’ button.

He announced a package of measures and Government cash towards tackling anti-social behaviour, giving greater support to tenants and landlords.

Currently it can take over a year to remove neighbours from hell, who during that time can cause absolute misery for local residents and bring down the wider neighbourhood.

But Mr Shapps today announced that he plans to strengthen the hand of residents, councils and housing associations to act. So he will introduce a new additional mandatory ground for possession, so those tenants with a track record of anti-social behaviour can be evicted from their council or housing association property much more quickly.

Ministers believe this will lead to a faster and fairer courts process - being found guilty of housing related anti-social behaviour in one court will provide automatic grounds for eviction in the county court, removing the need to prove the incidents of anti-social behaviour for a second time.

To further speed up the courts process, Mr Shapps announced that he would be exploring jointly with the Justice Department whether there were any unnecessary obstacles to the swift resolution of ASB possession cases where serious harm is being caused to individuals and communities.

Mr Shapps has also announced that he will dedicate £300,000 of Government funding to a new central team to help tenants and landlords tackle the blight of neighbours from hell in their communities.

Grant Shapps said:

For too long, too many social tenants have lived in fear of neighbours from hell, whose nasty and vicious behaviour blights their neighbourhoods. Victims and witnesses often have to continue living side by side with the perpetrators while action to evict them drags on for many months and sometimes years.

That’s why I want to give hope to these victims that this can and will be stopped. So I will introduce a new mandatory ground for possession, so any tenant convicted of serious anti-social behaviour can be evicted much more quickly. And I’m giving landlords and residents the support they need to reclaim their streets and make their houses feel like homes again.

I want any tenant who comes forward to report anti-social behaviour in their area to get the support they need and deserve. And I want landlords to use the full range of powers at their disposal to tackle this menace head-on, so that the disruptive minority of social tenants don’t make everyone else’s lives a misery.

Crime Prevention Minister James Brokenshire said:

Anti-social behaviour ruins lives and damages our communities. It is essential those who raise the alarm and ask for help are listened to and their complaints acted upon promptly.

These measures announced today will give greater powers to social landlords and residents to take a firm stand against the bullies and the troublemakers who commit persistent anti-social behaviour and help protect some of the most vulnerable victims from sometimes daily abuse.

Mr Shapps will also clarify the rules around the use of ‘probationary tenancies’, which are normally offered to new tenants for up to a year. The Minister will look to reassure housing associations that they have the same freedoms as council landlords to provide longer ‘probationary’ tenancies. That will mean all social landlords can be confident that they can extend these less secure tenancies for new tenants by up to six months, giving them the extra time they may need to be certain that these new residents treat their home, and their neighbours, with respect.

The Government is also reviewing the anti-social behaviour tool and powers available to the police, councils and social landlords and will publish a consultation on proposed changes shortly.

Action already taken includes launching a new trial in eight police force areas for handling complaints of anti-social behaviour, which will help to quickly identify and protect the most vulnerable victims. The Government has also appointed Baroness Newlove as Champion for Active, Safer Communities to help drive up confidence in our communities.

Up to €8 million of subcontract work to be delivered by British businesses.

UK Export Finance (UKEF) has announced a €22 million direct loan to support the construction of a rural water supply project in the Quiminha region of Angola that will be delivered by British firms.

Delivered by Elecnor Servicios y Proyectos S.A.U. on behalf of Angola’s Ministry of Public Works, this project will rehabilitate the Quiminha Dam and deliver new infrastructure for the storage and distribution of water. This will provide access to clean water for around 100,000 people in rural communities like Vila Catete, Vila Quiminha, Vila Lalama, Calumbunze and Camizunzo.

The project is expected to improve living conditions and support economic development in the Quiminha region – an important agricultural area – by providing a reliable source of potable water that can also meet industrial and agricultural needs.

The UKEF loan secures new opportunities for UK exporters, which are expected to deliver around €8 million in UK subcontracts.

This ground-breaking deal will provide vital water management that will transform lives.

Our partnership with Angola is strong, and this funding will provide huge benefits, including new water supplies and protection from the harsh impacts of climate related events including drought.

By teaming up to tackle climate change now, we are creating a resilient and sustainable future - it is clear that we can go far when we work together.

Standard Chartered was mandated by the Ministry of Finance, Angola, as the sole Coordinator and Structuring Bank, Social Loan Coordinator and Mandated Lead Arranger.

This financing in Angola aligns with the Bank’s commitment to drive capital into areas that require sustainable infrastructure across our markets, allowing us to make a positive difference across our geographies and communities.

We are extremely proud to continue contributing after 30 years to the development and clean growth of Angola in both the water and energy sectors.

Thanks to our partners from UKEF and Standard Chartered for their support in our third transaction with UKEF in Angola, by investing in drinking water projects, we are not only ensuring access to clean water to the region but also underscoring our dedication to fostering economic growth and enhancing the quality of life in Angola.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps today welcomed new figures showing a “rapid and dramatic” increase in the numbers of new affordable homes being built.

Figures published today by the Homes and Communities Agency show that affordable housing starts in the six-month period to March 2012 were up by nearly 15,000 compared to the first half of the last financial year.

At the same time, the numbers of affordable homes for rent and affordable home ownership completed in the 12 months to March stood at over 51,000.

Grant Shapps said:

Far from the predictions of the doom merchants, today’s figures show work has started on over 15,000 new affordable homes since last September - a massive increase on the previous six month period. This is clear evidence that our efforts to get Britain building are starting to yield impressive results.

I am also impressed at how, as we’ve moved to our new housebuilding programme, developers up and down the country have taken up the exciting opportunity to build thousands of new affordable homes. This rapid and dramatic progress means that we are well on track to exceed all original expectations and deliver up to 170,000 new affordable homes over the next few years.

But even with the need to cut the record deficit we inherited, I’m clear there’s still more to do. That’s why on top of the £4.5billion we’re investing in affordable homes, we’re also spending £1.3billion to get stalled developments back on track and to build the infrastructure needed to unlock sites for housing.",Investment in affordable homes (£4.5 billion) and spending on stalled developments (£1.3 billion),Welfare,,id25_352

Putting community budgets at the heart of how we deliver services

Community Budgets for families with multiple problems will create better public services by bringing together all local priorities and public money so agencies can find the right solutions to issues in their area in a new and co-ordinated way.

The Deputy Prime Minister invited councils to sign up for Community Budgets. Around fifty more authorities will get Community Budgets this year and then at least a further sixty in 2012-13. This follows the success of sixteen pioneer areas that have put in place plans to support the first 10,000 families.

These families are less than one per cent of the population, but are seen by as many as 20 different public and voluntary sector professionals at a cost of £4billion a year. A Salford family required 250 interventions in one year including 58 police call-outs and five arrests; five 999 visits to Accident and Emergency; two injunctions; and a Council Tax arrears summons. Their Community Budget led to the £200,000 cost being cut by two thirds.

The Deputy Prime Minister also announced that four new Community Budgets pilots will be launched to explore how communities can have greater control over services through a single budget from Whitehall, as part the Government’s review into local government finances.

A prospectus will be issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government at the end of the summer setting out the details for creating these single budget pilots.

The Deputy Prime Minister said:

Every Government preaches localism. This Government will practice it. In terms of real decentralisation, money talks. We need to reverse decades of centralisation to make our communities masters of their own economic destinies. We have to create the conditions for communities to invest in their own success. That means putting our money where our mouth is to give local authorities proper power over spending as well as more control over the taxes raised and keep so, for example, they can fight to attract businesses to come to their area.

We will also be putting community budgets at the heart of how we deliver services. There are families that have been let down by the system. Their complex problems mean they can end up seeing dozens of professionals across public services - but those professionals aren’t always joined up, making it near impossible for anyone to get an overall picture of what that family needs. Community budgets are budgeting for real life, breaking down the barriers between different parts of the machine, and treating people with troubles like human beings, not figures on a spreadsheet.

The Deputy Prime Minister also announced that the Department for Communities and Local Government will introduce a Local Government Finance Bill that will throw the Whitehall shackles off local government funding by giving councils the freedom to borrow against business rates, known as Tax Increment Financing, and to retain business rates.

The first phase of the Local Government Resource Review is considering options to enable councils to retain locally raised business rates. Real progress is being made and it is expected to report in the summer. A second phase set out today deals with Community Budgets.

Eric Pickles added:

It makes no sense that 120,000 families cost the country £4billion because inefficient public services are duplicating work. Community Budgets will radically change that by giving local councils and communities control over how public money spent in their area is used.

We are extending the reach of Community Budgets so that more local services across the country work in partnership to knock back the bureaucratic processes that box them into working alone.

Tim Loughton, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children said:

This is a once in a life time opportunity for the most disadvantaged families in society. We know that a key worker providing well coordinated no nonsense support helps spur families to overcome even the most complex problems, get their children learning and into school and parents into work. This new programme will mean over half of local authorities in England will get help to make these changes this year.

Community Budgets were announced as part of the Spending Review 2010 (seewww.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1748116) and the first 16 Community Budgets were launched by the 1st April (seewww.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1875618).

Detail of the Local Government Resource Review Terms of Reference (phase two: Community Budgets) published today are available at:www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/1933423.pdf.

Detail of the Local Government Resource Review Terms of Reference (phase one: Business Rate retention) published on 17 March 2011 are available at:www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/1913801.pdf.

The Government will be writing out to all Councils shortly setting out more detail about the national roll out of Community Budgets for families with multiple problems and the pilots of radical options.

Each Community Budget area will be offered support from voluntary and private sector experts in redesigning local services and using new and more effective ways to help families as well as deliver savings in local service costs. Further details are available at:www.education.gov.uk/childrenandyoungpeople/families/multipleproblems.

Around 40-50,000 families experience multiple social, economic and health as well as serious child problems whilst a larger group, possible around 70,000 (making around 120,000 families in total) are at a much greater risk of developing these problems. The needs of these families (and the problems they can caused others) can be so great that up to 20 different professionals costing up to £250-£350,000 can be involved in trying to help them. Last December the Prime Minister announced that his ambition was to try to turn around the lives of the most troubled families by the end of this Parliament.

Nine centres or ‘Dissemination Hubs’ based within local authorities around the country will provide practical support to neighbouring areas in developing services for these families. Whitehall officials will be assigned to help areas ‘bust’ financial and legal barriers to achieving local ambitions by pooling budgets, changing working practices and investing in service reorganisation. Funding for local services for families will come from a wide range of local services all of whom stand to gain by reducing the demands many of these families make on their services. This includes Department for Education’s £2.2bn a year Early Intervention Grant and Department for Work and Pensions £200m a year European Social Funding announced this month.

Support for areas will focus on promoting successful local practice. Family Intervention Projects and services pioneered by local authorities have been shown to deliver significant improvements in family outcomes and savings in a wide range of service costs for a fraction of this amount within 12 months. Department for Education funding for over 30 local authority and voluntary sector projects will help to build this evidence and develop new ways of working.

For example in Islington the Council, the NHS, Job Centre Plus, Probation, Police, housing and the voluntary sector is pooling staff and over £6m of resources for their Community Budget plan. This will allow them to give intensive support to families facing particular problems in the area. Half of the children in this borough live in poverty and the vast majority live in a household where no one works.

A new Family Outreach Support Service will support a thousand families with persistent problems. They will also look to prevent 9000 unemployed families from falling into crisis. The professionals are joining up the dots to give families early, coordinated support reducing the number of people and places they get support from.

The European Social Fund is a European Union structural fund which aims to improve employment opportunities for workers in the internal market by complementing Member States’ jobs and training policies. The new programme will be delivered by private and voluntary sector organisations working with local authorities. The provision will operate on a payment by results basis, with providers rewarded for helping move members of the families they are working with closer to a point where they are ready to apply for work and get a job. The aim will then be to help individuals in those families get into work directly, or through mainstream support such as the Government’s new Work Programme.

UK will provide vital support to Iraq through the provision of fire engines, with biggest overhaul of Iraqi fleet this century being financed by a UK Export Finance loan.

Independent businesses in Yorkshire and Ayrshire are to supply these vehicles for use across Iraq.

Two British businesses are delivering one of Iraq’s biggest-ever investments into its emergency services thanks to a c. $31 million loan from UK Export Finance (UKEF), the government’s export credit agency.

The loan allows Iraq’s Ministry of Interior to purchase 62 British-made fire-fighting vehicles each capable of carrying up to 6,500 litres of water and 500 litres of foam.

Promoting investment into local businesses and employers, the partnership supports this government’s Plan for Change to boost economic growth across all regions.

Ayrshire-headquartered Emergency One and Batley-based Angloco have been selected to supply vehicles for Iraq’s Civil Defence Directorate.

Emergency One, the UK’s leading manufacturer of fire and rescue vehicles, supplies over 90% of the UK’s fire and rescue services and continues to grow its international presence. Angloco, a well-established SME, exports to over 70 countries worldwide. Both companies bring significant expertise and innovation to this contract, further strengthening their impact in the Gulf region.

Frequent outbreak of fires in Iraq, particularly during the summer months, can cause devastating effect to businesses, communities, and key infrastructure.

By helping buyers to purchase UK exports more easily, UKEF loans secure large contracts with favourable payment terms for British businesses – including small businesses likely to need payment upfront before they can deliver a contract.

J.P. Morgan acted as both Sole Mandated Lead Arranger and agent bank for the loan.

We have a Plan for Change to help grow our economy and support workers right across the country, and that’s precisely what these deals are about.

Shining a spotlight on cutting edge tech and highly skilled jobs, this announcement shows the UK’s exporting potential and manufacturing strength.

The Government of Iraq is contracting with British companies through the UKEF Loan to import specialized firefighting vehicles for the Directorate of Civil Defence.

This will contribute significantly to the strengthening of the Directorate’s capabilities through the use of high-quality vehicles. This demonstrates the continuous support received by the Directorate by the UK and will improve our ability to tackle fire incidents.

J.P. Morgan is delighted to support the finance of firefighting equipment from the UK to the Republic of Iraq.

This is the latest UKEF deal giving businesses the support they need to deliver contracts and drive change at home in the UK and overseas in Iraq. In 2023, a UKEF guarantee helped British firms tosecure over £100 million in export contractsto support the installation of 350km in drainage infrastructure around Hillah city.

Through the government’s Levelling Up white paper, areas such as County Durham, Cornwall and Hartlepool are set to benefit from improved schools, part of a package of measures that will also boost take-up of high-quality training across England and support stable families that help children to succeed.

The plans being published tomorrow (Wednesday 2 February) will identify 55 cold spots of the country where school outcomes are the weakest, to target investment, support and action that help children from all backgrounds and areas to succeed at the very highest levels. These include Rochdale, the Isle of Wight, Walsall, parts of Yorkshire and Sunderland.

As 95% of these areas are outside London and the South East, it is the struggling schools of the North, Midlands, East of England and South West that will be receiving much more support over the next decade.

In these new ‘Education Investment Areas’, the Department for Education will offer retention payments to help schools keep the best teachers in the highest priority subjects. These areas will be prioritised as the location for new specialist sixth-form free schools where there is limited provision to ensure talented children from disadvantaged backgrounds have access to the highest standard of education this country offers.

Schools in these areas that have been judged less than Good in successive Ofsted inspections could be moved into strong multi-academy trusts, to attract more support and the best teachers. This will be subject to a consultation in the spring.

The paper will set a new national mission to ensure that 90% of children leaving primary school in England are reaching the expected standard in reading, writing, and maths by 2030. In 2019, just 65% of pupils met all 3 standards, with the proportion substantially varying across the country.

Schools in the Education Investment Areas will also be given support to address wider issues. For instance, schools struggling with attendance will be encouraged to join a new pilot programme to tackle the issue.

Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said:

The most valuable resource on the planet is the human resource. Investing in people to get on in life and receive the best possible education is core to the mission of this government, and we are determined to help people gain the knowledge and skills needed to unleash their potential.

This white paper sets out our blueprint for putting skills, schools and families at the heart of levelling up. It focuses on putting great schools in every part of the country, training that sets you up for success in a high-skilled, well-paid career and ensuring no one misses out on opportunities simply because of where they live or their family background.

Raising our expectations and aspirations for children, as well as creating a high-skilled workforce, will end the brain drain that sees too many people leaving communities in order to succeed. These plans will help create a level playing field and boost the economy, both locally and nationally.

In direct response to the activities young people said they want outside of school, the government has announced a National Youth Guarantee. Backed by £560 million worth of investment, plans set to be outlined in the Levelling Up white paper will mean that every young person in England will have access to regular clubs and activities, adventures away from home and volunteering opportunities by 2025.

An extra £200 million is also being invested in the government’s Supporting Families programme in England, helping create strong, stable families where children thrive. This brings total investment to £695 million to improve the lives of up to 300,000 vulnerable families. The programme will help local areas tackle the challenges families face that can hold children back from attending and achieving at school or put them at risk of neglect or harm.

Minister for Levelling up Communities and Equalities Kemi Badenoch said:

Our Supporting Families programme is providing the most vulnerable families with the help they need to build a better future.

This help means more children returning to the classroom, more parents out of work starting a job and more support for the victims of domestic abuse.

Alongside these reforms will be a new skills mission set by the government to help improve people’s lives and boost the economy. This will target 200,000 more people in England to help them complete high-quality training each year by 2030, including 80,000 more completing courses in areas of England with the lowest skills levels.

Skills are a crucial driver of economic disparities between people and places, so the mission will help level up opportunities in left behind areas. Boosting skills improves human capital which can drive up earnings potential and life chances for people who have already left school.

To better understand the skills gaps, the Education Secretary is establishing a new Future Skills Unit which will look at the data and evidence of where skills gaps exist and in what industries.

Thousands more adults will soon be able access free, flexible training and get the skills needs to secure careers in sectors including green, digital and construction as part of up to an additional £550 million boost to expand the popularSkills Bootcampsacross the country. Prisoners can also now take advantage of Skills Bootcamps as part of a new trial to support them to find work on their release, levelling up opportunities for more people.

The plans published tomorrow will also set out the government’s commitment to making Institutes of Technology the pre-eminent organisation for technical STEM education in England, through which successful ones may apply for a Royal Charter. This will help secure their long-term position as anchor institutions in their regions, placing them on a par with the UK’s world-leading historic universities.

The government will also aim to double the capacity of theSupported Internship programmeto provide thousands more young people who have additional needs with the skills to secure and sustain paid employment. Backed by £18 million over 3 years, the programme will additionally drive up the standards and quality of internship delivery across the country for students who have an education, health and care plan.

Children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), their families and caregivers will be better supported with respite care and internship opportunities. Councils will be funded £30 million for the next 3 years to set up more than 10,000 additional respite placements, helping to provide positive opportunities for disabled children and young people and to give family carers a break so they can look after vulnerable children better in the long-term.

All local authorities which contain 1 of 12 of the government’sOpportunity Areaswill be designated as Education Investment Areas, and so will benefit from these interventions. Opportunity Areas have been and continue to be effective, with their funding extended up to the end of August 2022.

The new funding for respite and Supported Internships come alongside more than £45 million of continued targeted support for families and parents of children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). These programmes will:

The 55 areas selected as Education Investment Areas to raise school standards include Bedford, Blackpool, Bolton, Bradford, Bury, Cambridgeshire, Central Bedfordshire, Cornwall, County Durham, Coventry, Darlington, Derby, Derbyshire, Doncaster, Dorset, Dudley, East Sussex, Halton, Hartlepool, Isle of Wight, Kirklees, Knowsley, Leeds, Lincolnshire, Liverpool, Luton, Manchester, Middlesbrough, Norfolk, North Northamptonshire, North Somerset, North Yorkshire, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, Oldham, Peterborough, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Rochdale, Rotherham, Salford, Sandwell, Sefton, Somerset, South Gloucestershire, South Tyneside, St. Helens, Stoke-on-Trent, Suffolk, Sunderland, Swindon, Tameside, Wakefield, Walsall and Wirral.

The reforms are designed to provide investors with transparency, longevity and certainty in order to attract £110 billion of investment to bring forward new low-carbon power generation for the 21st Century.

Over the next decade, around a fifth of existing power generating capacity will come off-line.

Without these reforms, we could in the future see blackouts affecting millions of homes in some years.  We would also be more dependent on importing oil and gas from overseas, this could present geopolitical risks and make our energy supply unsecure.

Demand for electricity will grow by 2050 as it is increasingly used to power our transport and domestic heating.

This leaves the UK with an energy gap which needs to be filled.

Secretary of State Edward Davey said:

“Leaving the electricity market as it is would not be in the national interest. If we don’t secure investment in our energy infrastructure, we could see the lights going out, consumers hit by spiralling energy prices and dangerous climate change.

“These reforms will ensure we can keep the lights on, bills down and the air clean.

“The reforms will also be better for the economy, leaving us less vulnerable to rising global energy prices and supporting as many as 250,000 jobs in the energy sector.

“By reforming the market, we can ensure security of supply for the long-term, reduce the volatility of energy bills by reducing our reliance on imported gas and oil, and meet our climate change goals by largely decarbonising the power sector during the 2030s”.

The draft Energy Bill proposes radical reform to the electricity market to attract the £110 billion required to build new low-carbon capacity.

It will be designed to encourage a **balanced portfolio of renewables, new nuclear and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), **and to ensure that these technologies can compete fairly in the market-place.

The main elements of the Bill are:

National Grid is to be appointed as the delivery body for EMR, to provide analytical basis for Government decisions and to administer two new market mechanisms:

These mechanisms will be supported by:

With or without reform, household electricity bills are likely to increase over time, driven primarily by rising fossil fuel prices.

However, electricity market reforms will help to reduce the amount that bills will increase.  As a result of these reforms, electricity bills are estimated to be, on average, 4% lower over the next two decades than they would otherwise have been.  Average bills for businesses and energy intensive industries will also be lower than without reform.

Gas will continue to play an important role in the transition to a low-carbon economy, to provide flexibility and help maintain security of supply. A separate strategy on the role of gas will be published in autumn 2012.",Two new market mechanisms,Administrative,,id25_356

The Rt Hon Chris Huhne MP will today put the spotlight on the economic benefits to Britain of investing in green energy in Wales.

This financial year renewable energy developers have announced plansin Wales for £779.8m investment, with the potential to create almost 1400 jobs,as the nation begins to realise its huge economic potential and produce clean, home-grown energy.

Speaking at an annual conference of the renewables industry, The Rt Hon Chris Huhne MP will today hail renewable energy sources like wind, wave and biomass as already delivering a “third industrial revolution” across the UK.

Huhne will cite progress in the last six months, where industry has announced plans to invest £1.7bn and create over 9,000 jobs “from the Western Isles to the Isle of Wight”.

The Energy Secretary will say:

“Renewable energy technologies will deliver a third industrial revolution. Its impact will be every bit as profound as the first two.

“The revolution has already begun, from the Western Isles to the Isle of Wight. Across the length and breadth of Britain, new companies are creating new jobs and delivering the technologies that will power our future.

“At a time when closures and cuts dominate the news cycle, next-generation industries are providing jobs and sinking capital into Britain.

“I want to take aim at the curmudgeons and faultfinders who hold forth on the impossibility of renewables. The climate sceptics and armchair engineers who are selling Britain’s ingenuity short.

“Yes, climate change is a manmade disaster. Yes, the UK is only 2% of global carbon emissions. But if we grasp the opportunity now our businesses and economy can be much more than 2% of the solution.

“We are not going to save our economy by turning our back on renewable energy.

“It is this three-party consensus that makes the UK such a good place to invest.

“So I can today assure you that this government has resolved that we will be the largest market in Europe for offshore wind.”

Wales has great potential to benefit from the growth in green energy with several major renewables projects announced in the last six months including:

The review of regulations will reflect the approach taken in the Housing Strategy published in November last year. The Strategy outlines how the Government is committed to better environmental standards, more affordable housing, security of tenure, legal protection for tenants and leaseholders, and support for the elderly, vulnerable households and those on low incomes.

The Government has already taken a series of steps to cut unnecessary red tape, including abolishing Home Information Packs, reducing burdens on short-term holiday lets, removing blanket regulation on Houses of Multiple Occupation that would have reduced choice for tenants, and introduced new freedoms and flexibilities for social landlords via the Localism Act. This review will help inform the scope for further reductions of unnecessary and disproportionate red tape.

The Sector Champions will be supporting the review by using their experience and industry contacts to help shine the spotlight on our Red Tape Challenge theme.

Simon Randall CBE is a solicitor specialising in housing and also has a strong background in local government having served as a Councillor and through his work with Housing Associations such as chairing Broomleigh Housing Association. In his spare time, he is also actively involved in supporting mutuals and co-operatives.

Stephen Greenhalgh is Councillor for Town Ward in Fulham and Leader of Hammersmith and Fulham Council. He has extensive experience of the local government and housing sector. He is a successful entrepreneur and, as a landlord himself also understands the business perspective.

Both champions are keen to be involved in the Red Tape Challenge and to support the Department.

Simon Randall said:

The housing and construction sectors are arguably the most highly regulated in the UK. There is enormous scope for reducing red tape which could both increase and speed up the supply of private rented and social housing without in any way compromising on quality, security or sustainability. This will be the overall challenge for the sectors and I look forward to their suggestions for abolition or simplification of existing regulations.

Communities will be given new powers to decide how they want their streets to look in future, and how they want existing streets to be changed to suit their needs.

A common complaint from communities across the country, both to Ministers and experts such as Living Streets, is that for too long their areas have been blighted by a unsightly mess of shop signs, billboards and railings that are unwanted and unneeded.

Previously local residents have felt powerless to act, but now new rules in the Localism Bill will mean communities can produce a neighbourhood development plan, which includes policies to improve the public spaces in their area.

This could include reducing street clutter and improving the quality of shop signs and other street furniture. Contributions from developers, which are connected to planning applications for new building projects, would then enable this work to go ahead.

Mr Shapps also argued that people wanting to see a change can get involved in other ways to make clear the clutter from their streets. He urged councils and communities to follow the example of Sutton where, with the help of local people, the council is working to tackle street clutter. Residents have been urged to come forward with their worst examples, which the council can then focus on and tackle.

Sutton is a Big Society vanguard area, and Mr Shapps said that other councils who want to follow their lead but are struggling in the face of bureaucratic burdens should get in touch through the Department’s Barrier Busting website - saying that any council coming forward with suggestions for cutting red tape would be listened to.

It follows the launch of a nationwide campaign against street clutter, where people across the country were encouraged to contact their council with their concerns.

Grant Shapps said:

For years too many streets across the country have been ruined by a tasteless jumble of shop signs, railings and billboards, and the people who live there have been left powerless to clear away this clutter.

Well enough’s enough. We want to give power back to local people so they can decide what their neighbourhoods look like. So residents will soon have new powers to protect and improve the appearance of their neighbourhood.

But people don’t need to wait; they can start taking action straightaway. Just like in Sutton, communities can go to their councils with local examples of street clutter and demand something be done. This is the Big Society in action - communities taking action to improve the lives of local people.

And if councils are facing an uphill battle they can follow in the footsteps of Sutton and get in touch with me - as Sutton has found, they will be pushing at an open door.

Cllr Colin Hall, Sutton Council’s Executive Member for Environment and Climate Change, said:

We’ve made some enormous strides by working with local people to get rid of some of the clutter that blights our streets. The important thing is make sure it’s our residents who design our streets not Whitehall bureaucrats.

We’ve held a street audit where we’ve gone along a street with traders and residents, looking at things like signposts, railings and lighting columns and asking the question: ‘Are these really needed?’ In one area, we’ve managed to do away with around 100m of guard railings and 17 separate traffic light poles on a single junction - without compromising road safety.

It’s a relatively easy thing to do. Although it does cost some money to remove the street clutter, it can work out cheaper in the long run as we see lower maintenance bills.

We’ve still got work to do though. However, we’re pleased to be working with Government to cut through regulation that stops our residents having the neighbourhoods they want.

Tony Armstrong, Chief Executive of Living Streets said:

Pedestrians have to struggle with unnecessary bollards, guard-railing and pointless signs on a daily basis so Living Streets welcomes initiatives to make it easier for local people to rid their communities of the clutter that blights our streets.

Community powers, stronger guidance from central government and a coordinated approach from local councils are all vital to rid our streets of unnecessary obstacles for pedestrians. Councils in particular should use this opportunity to ensure that de-cluttering is prioritised and championed across all departments to help both cost saving and responding to community needs.

Through our own audits with local communities and councils, we have found that stripping back street clutter transforms our streets from trip hazards to enjoyable open spaces where people want to walk. We welcome steps towards cutting the clutter.

Cllr Nick Paget-Brown, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea’s Cabinet Member for Transportation and Highways, said:

We’ve been carrying out ward-by-ward streetscape reviews since 2003 so it’s not surprising we are fully behind the Government’s efforts to encourage councils and their communities to tackle street clutter. Over this time we’ve worked closely with local businesses and residents’ representatives to identify ways to declutter their neighbourhoods, resulting in the removal of almost 1,000 unnecessary posts and signs. We’ve moved another 200 useful signs to lamp columns, walls or railings.

1. The Localism Bill will give communities powers to plan for their areas and deliver the development they want through neighbourhood planning. Communities will be able to create a vision of what their area should look like. This will include shop signs, billboards and railings on buildings, as well as influence in deciding where new shops, offices or homes should go and what green spaces should be protected.

2. Many people have great ideas about how they could make their neighbourhood a better place to live. But sometimes barriers get in the way. Red tape, rules and regulations stop people putting good ideas into action. Ministers have set up a team of ‘barrier busters’ dedicated to helping local people put their ideas into action. To find out more about the barrier busting team, and how to submit your request for help, visit the special barrier busting pages atbarrierbusting.communities.gov.uk(external link).

3. Other examples of councils tackling street clutter include the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council. Their most recent projects include:

King’s Road - Unnecessary street furniture was removed. Street furniture that continued to serve a useful purpose or, where residents asked, such as heritage bollards, were kept. Where possible, the Royal Borough integrated street lighting columns with traffic signals, signage and litter bins; and

Improvement work to the area outside the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in Fulham Road. These improvements  were designed to create an attractive space and to make it easier for the large number of people who use the area to move about more freely. Unnecessary barriers and clutter were removed to create a high quality public space for the hospital frontage:www.rbkc.gov.uk/environmentandtransport/roadsandhighways/chelseaandwestminster.aspx(external link).

Exhibition Road - It runs from South Kensington in the south to Hyde Park in the north, is home to some of the most important visitor attractions in the country. By 2012 the crowded, narrow pavements and heavy traffic will go. In their place they will make a kerb-free surface across the length and width of the road. Pedestrians will have more space and vehicles will be limited to 20mph:www.rbkc.gov.uk/subsites/exhibitionroad.aspx(external link).

Council …","Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (2018 to 2021) and The Rt Hon Lord Pickles",30 July 2010,"The public will be given the power to veto excessive council tax rises, Local Government Secretary, Eric Pickles, announced today.

Council tax bills across England have doubled since 1997, pushing the average bill to £120 a month on a Band D home. The police authority levy imposed on council tax has trebled since 1997.

The new Government has already committed to help councils to freeze council tax. In parallel, steps are now being taken to help prevent bills skyrocketing down the line by giving local people the final say in a vote on excessive increases. This will replace top-down council tax capping by Whitehall, which gave no choice to local residents.

Under the new proposals laid out in a technical consultation today, any council that set its council tax increase above a set ceiling, approved in a democratic and transparent manner by Parliament each year, would trigger an automatic referendum of all registered electors in their area.

Residents would be asked to choose between the proposed rise and a ‘shadow budget’, which the council must also prepare within the defined limit. A no vote would leave councils having to refund taxpayers or give a credit at the end of the tax year.

The previous Government stepped in to take capping action against 36 authorities which set excessive rises. Some of the highest rises were South Cambridgeshire who tried to set a 100 per cent increase in 2005-06 and Lincolnshire Police Authority a 79 per cent increase in 2008-09.

The Secretary of State is determined to reverse the presumption that Whitehall knows best by making local councils directly accountable to the local taxpayer. Today’s proposals would mean councils have to defend their budget decisions and bill increases to the local electorate instead of Whitehall.

Eric Pickles said:

Hardworking families and pensioners were left feeling powerless and frustrated in the past thirteen years, as council tax bills doubled while their frontline services like weekly bin collections were halved.

If councils want to increase council tax further, they will have to prove the case to the electorate. Let the people decide.

The new Government is committed to a review of local government resource, but such reforms must go hand in hand with measures to protect the interests of local taxpayers.

This is a radical extension of direct democracy, as part of a wider programme of decentralising power to local communities. Power should not just be given to councils, but be devolved further down to neighbourhoods and citizens.

Council tax bills hit £1,439 on Band D in England in 2010-11. By contrast, council tax was £688 in 1997-98. This means council tax in this period has risen 109 per cent - or an extra £751 a year on a Band D home. Since all other Bands are set as a percentage of Band D, every type of home has seen their bill double. The average police precept on council tax in England has trebled from £54 on Band D in 1997-98 to £161 in 2010-11. Average council tax and percentage change 1993-94 to 2010-11:www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1518299.xls.

The new proposals will ensure that councils know where they stand, as they will know in advance what the threshold is that will trigger a referendum. Under the capping regime, they were not told of capping limits until after they set their council tax increases. This threshold will be approved democratically and transparently by Parliament. Council tax referendums will replace the old regime of Whitehall capping. Ministers have written to the Welsh Assembly Government offering to extend the powers to the Welsh Assembly to offer similar protections and rights for council tax payers in Wales.

The technical consultation includes measures to tacklede minimisincreases, for example by parish councils, options to avoid expensive re-billing, and the mechanism by which a referendum would take place. Primary legislation is required to change the law. The right of veto is expected to be in place for council tax bills issued in March 2012.

In recent years there has been a marked growth in the frequency and scope of council publicity techniques funded by taxpayers’ money, whilst local papers have struggled in a saturated news environment. Mr Pickles has raised strong concerns over this use of taxpayers’ money. He believes councils should focus their resources on protecting front line services.

A new publicity code strengthening the rules for English councils on what can be considered appropriate spending of taxpayers’ money is now in force after approval by Parliament. Mr Pickles said that the new rules would strengthen the local democratic process.

The new rules bring to an end politically contentious advertising campaigns, prevent municipal newspapers being published more than four times a year, and halt the hiring of lobbyists by councils.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

We said that we would bring an end to improper council publicity and now a new code of practice is in force. These new rules make it crystal clear that taxpayers’ money should be for protecting front line services not printing Pravdas or paying for professional lobbyists to put the squeeze on Whitehall. Publicity straying into propaganda clearly crosses the line of appropriate public funding whilst film reviews and TV listings sit far beyond the realm of council news.

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

As councils strive to cut back waste their public spending should be under more scrutiny than ever and a vibrant and independent local press has a vital role to play holding those local leaders to account. But the boom in funded council papers in recent years has left many local newspapers out in the cold. Today we’re giving local papers a fresh start.

Seven fundamental principles set out in the revised Code of Recommended Practice on Local Authority Publicity will make sure that council publicity is lawful, objective, appropriate, even handed and cost effective, with regard to equality and diversity and periods of heightened sensitivity. “Appropriate use of publicity” is defined below:

advertising should be balanced, factually accurate and not likely to be perceived by the public as a political statement or a commentary on contentious areas of public policy

councils should not publish newspapers in direct competition to local press. They should not appear more than quarterly and should only include material directly related to local services. Parishes will be able to issue monthly

councils should not spend taxpayers’ money to lobby government through private sector lobbyists or through publicity stalls at party conferences

1. Full details of the new Government Code of Recommended Practice on Local Authority Publicity can be found here:www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/publicitycode2011.

2. The Code was originally introduced in 1988 and amended by the last Government in 2001. The revised Code applies to England only. The purpose of the Code was to ensure proper use of public funds for publicity. Effective, efficient publicity that successfully tells the public what they need to know about the services and activities of their council is legitimate; the public need information to hold their authority to account. The Publicity Code is statutory guidance to which local authorities have to have regard in the production of their publicity.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended in September by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the department but I’m delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.

England’s counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is 1 of the things that binds communities together and it’s right that the government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.

Tim StevensonOBE, Lord Lieutenant of Oxfordshire said:

Oxfordshire is a county famous for its university and its science and technology industries and car-making on the one hand and for Winston Churchill, Blenheim Palace and a fair share of the Cotswolds and the Chilterns on the other.

We are the most rural county in the South East but we have made and will continue to make a real contribution to English and British life. The fair people of Abingdon, Banbury, Bicester, Chipping Norton, Didcot, Henley, Oxford, Thame, Wantage and Witney and all points between are proud to have their county flag flying at the Department for Communities and Local Government.

Councillor Keith Mitchell, Leader of Oxfordshire County Council, said:

I am proud that our county flag will be flying at the Department for Communities and Local Government in London. I am an Englishman who is proud of his country - and this nation’s network of counties is integral to what being English is all about.

Our contribution to the region and the capital’s status as the engine of the UK economy is important to us here in this ancient yet modern shire.

All councils and Fire and Rescue Authorities are expected to publish details of all spending over £500 in full online by January. With just 64 working days till the start of the New Year the clock is ticking for councils to open their files so the public can see where their money is being spent.

As part of meeting the transparency target Mr Pickles has welcomed new guidance from the Local Government Association detailing best practice for putting council spending and senior salary information online. They stress the importance of ensuring that the data is clear, comprehensible, machine readable, licensed to encourage reuse and so local people know it’s available.

Mr Pickles’ own department continues to lead the way. This week it published all its spending data online for 2008-09 and for the first quarter of 2010-11.

Mr Pickles said:

I’ve called for a new era of transparency where all councils publish their spending over £500 online. I commend those councils that have been brave enough to face public scrutiny so far. There are now only sixty or so working days for those lagging behind to catch up.

This isn’t another central government box-ticking exercise. The public have a right to see how their council tax is being spent so they know they are getting value for money and the best possible frontline services.

I want to see an army of ‘Armchair Auditors’ pore over the information and hold their council to account if things are not done right. That means the data also has to be easily accessible: today advice has been published that will help councils yet to comply. There are hundreds of computer whizzes who’ll find creative new ways to make that raw data relevant to local life.

Central Government resources to assist citizens wanting to access national and local data for free re-use include the websitedata.gov.uk(external link). The CLG datasets published this week are available on thiswebsite. Other websites likeOpenlyLocal(external link) are also making it easier to access data and to interrogate or compare the published information.

Some councils have also found innovative ways of using their spending data. For example, Redbridge Council has created a truly innovative budgeting tool called ‘You Choose’ which lets the public try to balance the council’s budget themselves. This gives them a say on where every public penny goes in their area. It has been so successful that the Local Government Association has decided to sponsor it and make it available to all councils.

Professor Nigel Shadbolt of Southampton University, a member of the Public Sector Transparency Board said:

The publication of all spends by Local Authorities over £500 is hugely important. Authorities spend millions and millions of pounds in our name, so why shouldn’t we know how that money is spent?

It will be useful in a whole range of ways. We are going to be able to see what the pattern of spend is, what particular contractors are used and whether it represents value for money.  Once it’s published councils can have a discourse with the citizen to find out how they want their money to be spent and where they would want to save. This is another important step in the drive for open data and transparency at all levels and across all of Government.

Chris Taggart, creator of openlylocal.com added:

This is about a conversation with the people. Publishing information - which belongs to the public after all - allows them to look at local spending and say: wait a minute you could be saving money there.

There are all sorts of benefits to be gained from understanding the data and using the skills of the community to understand it. Councils themselves can benchmark their data and spending against other councils. People can build applications which will allow everyone to ask questions and join the conversation.

Getting data out in the open is just the first step for Government. The real potential for open government lies with greater transparency by unlocking innovation and analysis and scrutiny. Individuals and community groups can us the data understand the decisions councils take every day or to create new business opportunities who find solutions and ideas using the information in new ways. Here Communities Secretary Eric Pickles talk more about council transparency at:www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOwG7gGp_Y4(external link).

In line with the transparency agenda requirements on spend transparency for central government departments, councils should be publishing their own spend by January 2011. Today the LGA has published new advice about how councils should publish their spending details. It has taken the original advice of the Local Public Data Panel and sought to provide additional practical guidance. It sets out what should be included; how to make the information available under open license in machine readable format; and how to approach redactions and personal data. The guidance is currently aimed at councils, police authorities and fire and rescue authorities - but there is no reason why other public bodies such a parish councils and waste authorities should not also follow the guidance. Full details can be found at:http://lgtransparency.readandcomment.com(external link).

In line with the transparency agenda requirements on the pay of senior public servants, councils should have their salary information published by 31 January 2011 providing a snapshot from 31st October 2010. Data to be published for each individual includes; Organisation Name, Body (organisational identifier), Individual’s Name (subject to consent), Job title, Service Area, Full-Time Equivalent, FTE Pay band for disclosure - this will be shown in £5,000 bands (for instance, £80,000 £84,999). Councils are also asked to publish data on the scale of their authority in terms of; employment, expenditure and service responsibilities. The guidance, Transparency - publication of senior salary information Reporting Guidance, is intended to assist local authorities in the preparation and publication of senior salary information. Full details can be found at:www.idea.gov.uk/idk/core/page.do?pageId=21407431(external link).

Openly Local is a place to access data about the workings of your Local Council, without having to poke around through dense, difficult-to-navigate websites. It can be found at:http://openlylocal.com/councils/spending(external link).

Redbridge Council’s new ‘You Choose’ public engagement tool shows residents how the council currently spends their money and asks them to feed back and suggest how they can make savings. Redbridge council successfully trialled the tool last year and it has now been expanded to other councils across the country with the help of YouGov and the Local Government Association.

The Localism Bill will put an end to the centralisation of power in government allowing local communities and councils the freedom to run their lives and neighbourhoods in their own way.

The impact assessments report on the potential impact of implementing the decentralisation and localism elements of the coalition agreement. They will help promote the devolution of power away from Westminster and Whitehall to local councils and communities.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

“Any public policy has pros and cons. In one of the most comprehensive exercises undertaken by any government department to date, we are setting out our frank assessment of the effects of our radical proposals. This demonstrates our commitment to openness and transparency. These reports prove the net benefits to local economies, to local democracy and to community life of the coalition government’s decentralisation programme.”

The set of impact assessments should be considered together within the context of the overall Localism Bill. They cover the following:

Mr. Stunell said changes to the country’s building regulations would make new homes, shops and offices warmer and cheaper to run, support growth and take England a step closer to meeting its bold low carbon commitments.

Today’s ambitious measures, developed together with the construction industry, will help reduce the regulatory cost for businesses, and pave the way for the introduction of zero-carbon homes from 2016.

The proposals will also help with the roll out of the Green Deal this Autumn, stimulating demand, whilst helping to cut both carbon emissions and energy bills for householders.

The new set of Building Regulations published for consultation today will save over £63 million a year for businesses by cutting excessive red-tape and deliver safer and more sustainable buildings.

When these amendments come into force next year, more energy efficient homes will typically save householders over £150 a year on energy bills compared with homes being built in May 2010.

Homeowners will also save money with an extension to the range of simple, electrical DIY jobs that can be carried out without the need for a building inspector, reducing costs for both consumers and installers and the burden on local authorities who inspect work.

Launching the consultation, Mr Stunell said:

A quarter of the carbon emissions produced each year come from our homes, so it is vital we get to grips with energy efficiency to tackle this problem. Making our homes more sustainable will also keep people warm, drive down bills and support jobs in the construction industry.

The Coalition is committed to being the greenest government ever, so improving the energy efficiency of our existing buildings through the Green Deal, and ensuring that all new homes are zero carbon by 2016 is a top priority.

But we need to do this in a way that doesn’t add to the regulatory burden on businesses. So I’m delighted that these much-needed changes will provide guidance that is both fit for purpose and will cut carbon emissions, whilst also saving money for householders and businesses alike.

The Department is now looking for views and evidence on the proposed regulations and will continue working with industry and other key partners before finalising proposals.

1) The consultation opens today and responses can be provided up until 27 April 2012, other than the proposals related to the Green Deal where responses have been requested by 27 March 2012.

2) The Government will consider the responses and aim for new building regulations to come into force in 2013, although some changes might be brought in earlier to support the Green Deal framework.

3) The consultation document on the new proposed regulations has four sections:

changes to technical details

increasing the energy efficiency of buildings

electrical safety in homes; and

changes to the building control system.

4) The proposed 2013 changes take the next step towards the 2016 zero carbon standard for homes by tightening the carbon dioxide targets for new buildings and introducing specific energy efficiency targets for new homes.

5) The energy bill savings under this Government include those from 2010 Building Regulations changes as well as those proposed in this consultation.

The Coalition Government is committed, through the Localism Bill now passing through Parliament, to abolishing Regional Plans, which imposed housing targets on local communities and put pressure on councils to cut the Green Belt in 30 towns across the country.

The process of returning decision-making powers on housing and planning to local communities moved up a gear with the publication today of environmental assessments of the revocation of each Plan for consultation. The reports make it clear that revoking Regional Plans will mean there is less top down pressure on communities to review Green Belt.

Subject to Royal Assent of the Bill and the environmental assessments, the final abolition of each individual Regional Plan will be commenced after the assessment process has been completed.

Local Government Minister Bob Neill said:

This Government is putting an end to unpopular, undemocratic Regional Plans, which imposed development on communities and threatened the countryside.

These reports make it clear that revoking the Plans will protect communities and the environment from top down pressure to build on the Green Belt.“We are putting planning powers into the hands of local people to take charge of local housing challenges in a way that makes sense for them while protecting the local countryside and green spaces they value.”

1. Regional Spatial Strategies were introduced in 2004 and provided binding planning frameworks including nationally set housing targets at a regional level. They were drawn up by regional planning bodies and councils had to prepare their “Local Development Documents”, based on the Regional Spatial Strategy.

2. The Coalition Government is revoking these Regional Plans through the Localism Bill. We have undertaken voluntary assessment of the likely significant environmental effects of the revocation of the eight existing Regional Plans. The assessments have been carried out in line with the procedure set out in the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive.

3. Eight Environmental Reports are being published on the Department’s website today 20 October 2011, on which we are seeking comments from organisations and individuals. The period of consultation will be 12 weeks ending on 20 January 2012. Subject to the assessment process we expect the orders revoking the existing Regional Plans to take effect next Spring. The reports are available here:www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningenvironment/strategicenvironmentassess.

5. Towns and areas that were planning Green Belt reviews because of Whitehall-imposed targets will now be able to make their own decisions where new development is built. They include: Bath, Bedworth, Bournemouth, Bristol, Bromsgrove, Broxbourne, Cheltenham, Chertsey, Coventry, Gloucester, Guildford, Harlow, Hatfield, Hemel Hempstead, Leeds, Lichfield, Maidenhead, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Nottingham, Nuneaton, Oxford, Redditch, Redhill, Reigate, Rushcliffe, Stevenage, Solihull, Tunbridge Wells, Welwyn, and Woking and Worcester and in West Yorkshire beyond Leeds.

6. The Government is introducing a stronger locally-led planning system, where local communities decide where development goes and receive benefits from that development through the New Homes Bonus and Community Infrastructure Levy. Communities will also have the power to prevent encroachment on the Green Belt and will benefit from a new special protection for green spaces under the Localism Bill.

7. The draft National Planning Policy Framework also safeguards valued, national protection for our countryside including Green Belt, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and Sites of Special Scientific Interest to protect them from encroachment.

370,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mayoral-referendum-election-date-confirmed,News story,Mayoral referendum election date confirmed,"Ballot boxes will open on 3 May 2012 for voters to decide on directly elected mayors for England’s largest cities, Ministers confirmed today…","Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (2018 to 2021) and The Rt Hon Greg Clark",9 February 2012,"Ballot boxes will open on 3 May 2012 for voters to decide on directly elected mayors for England’s largest cities, Ministers confirmed today.

The Government believes that elected mayors can provide cities with the strong, visible leadership that will help them prosper nationally and internationally.

The Coalition Agreement proposed the creation of directly elected mayors in the 12 largest cities outside of London, subject to confirmatory referendum and full scrutiny by elected councillors.

Leicester has already elected a mayor and Liverpool has decided, following a resolution of the City Council, to move a mayoral form of government and hold an election for a mayor.

In the 10 remaining cities - in Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Coventry, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle Upon -Tyne, Nottingham, Sheffield and Wakefield, referendums will take place on 3 May 2012 for local people to decide whether to have a directly elected mayor. Liverpool’s election will also take place on the same day.

Greg Clark said:

Elected mayors can provide the strong, visible leadership to help our cities to prosper, attracting investment and jobs from home and abroad.

Our greatest cities can benefit from the prestige and international standing a mayor can bring, helping them to achieve their full potential.

For Britain to be successful our cities need to be successful. An elected mayor with a strong voice can seize the opportunities for their city to compete on the world stage.

Following the approval of Parliament, orders have today come into force giving the go-ahead for mayoral referendums. Where people vote in favour, the city will move to an elected mayor and hold elections on 15 November 2012.

The legal foundation for the role of directly elected mayors is the Government’s Localism Act, which contains a wide range of decentralising measures. Mayors will have a crucial role to play in shaping the ongoing process of reform - negotiating with Ministers to specify and secure the specific powers that each community needs to prosper.

The Coalition Agreement set out a commitment to create directly elected mayors in the 12 largest English cities outside London, subject to confirmatory referendums and full scrutiny by elected councillors. The Localism Act empowers local people to decide whether they want an elected mayor for their city. Mayoral referendums are being held on local Election Day on 3 May 2012.

If a city votes in favour of having a mayor at its referendum, that city will then hold an election for its first mayor on 15 November 2012. Mayors would be elected for four year terms.

Leicester elected their mayor in 2011. Liverpool plan to elect their mayor in May 2012.

The amount of previously-developed land owned by the public sector is more than twice the size of Leicester.

So the Minister today confirmed that by this Autumn, every Government department with significant landbanks will publish plans to release thousands of acres of previously-developed land to housebuilders, so they can get on and build the homes the country needs - supporting thousands of jobs and releasing funds to help in the vital work of bringing down the Budget deficit.

To make this radical ambition a reality by 2015 the Public Expenditure Committee, a Cabinet Committee chaired by Francis Maude, will go through each department’s plans with a fine tooth comb, to make sure every possible site is made available for housebuilding.

Alongside this, property specialists from across Government will work with each department and challenge them to release as much land as they can for new homes.

Ministers are also encouraging councils to follow the lead set by central Government and make their unused land available for development.

Later this year, a new map will be launched to show land and buildings owned by public bodies in each area. A new Community Right to Reclaim Land has been introduced enabling residents to apply to organisations including central Government departments and councils to bring their sites back into use - opening up the books so local people can see for themselves the assets held by central and local Government alike.

Grant Shapps also outlined his own department’s contribution, as the Homes and Communities Agency publishes its plans to release more land for redevelopment. This includes through a radical Build Now, Pay Later deal, which offers a boost to housebuilders who only pay for the land once work has started on the new homes - providing a lifeline to those struggling with cashflow problems, and enabling them to start building straight away.

Publicly owned sites such as the following have been, and are being, made available for new housing developments across the country:

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

As one of the country’s biggest landlords, the Government has a critical role to play in making sites available for developers so we can get the homes this country needs built.

So today, I can confirm an ambitious challenge across Government to release enough land from Whitehall’s grip for 100,000 new homes across the country. Over the coming months, property specialists will work to make sure no stone is left unturned and no site is left unused, and every department’s plans will come under the close scrutiny of a Cabinet committee.

The work starts today, with sites already being brought forward by three different departments, including my own, some of which will be available on new terms so developers can start building straight away. So we are already off to a flying start - it is now for developers to come forward, make the most of this unique opportunity, and help contribute to our country-wide efforts to help get the homes this country needs built.

Chief Secretary to Treasury Danny Alexander said:

This is a double dose of good news, creating and sustaining thousands of jobs by boosting housebuilders while also creating thousands of new homes for people to live in. Getting the economy growing is the Government’s top priority and this move, combined with other measures set out in the Plan for Growth to ease planning restrictions, are a key part of helping the private sector led recovery.

Mark Clare, Chief Executive of Barratt Developments PLC, said:

This is a big step in the right direction. The rapid release of publicly owned land has the potential to be an effective catalyst for increasing the supply of land for new homes in this country during the next few years.

Barratt has an established track record of working with public sector partners to build out important sites and deliver desperately needed new homes. We are already working on a number of Build Now Pay Later sites with the public sector and, in the wake of today’s announcement, will be looking at ways to expand and deepen that partnership.

Following consultation, legal changes are set to be made that will mean that those travellers who play by the rules will get more protection against eviction, putting them on an equal footing to those living on other residential caravan sites or in council houses.At the same time councils will be able to take swift action against any travellers who flout the rules of their tenancy agreements and they will be able to obtain possessions orders with less risk of legal challenge.

Councils will also be able to safeguard pitches for travellers who cannot afford to pay for a private pitch and who might be otherwise forced to camp on unauthorised sites, by not allowing tenancies to be automatically passed on when a caravan is sold or given to family members.

The changes come as part of the new Government’s plan to improve community relations between travellers and the settled community, which has already seen councils freed from the top-down Regional Strategies and the associated building targets; which now means that councils can decide for themselves how many traveller pitches are necessary in their area according to local need and historic demand. And at the same time, Mr Stunell is looking at ways to strengthen the powers available to councils to more effectively tackle unauthorised developments and unscrupulous private developers.

Ministers have also confirmed that new authorised traveller pitches will be treated on an equal footing as new bricks and mortar homes, with councils getting financial benefits for building authorised sites where they are needed.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

This is about redressing the balance, putting travellers and the settled population on a level playing field and bringing fairness back to communities.

The message is clear whether you live in a caravan or a bricks and mortar house, if you are a law-abiding citizen you have a right to have safe place to live.

But rest assured, we will not stand by and let people flout the planning rules that everyone else abides by, which is why we will strengthen the powers that councils have to take action against those who abuse the planning system.

373,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/people-power-in-liverpool-beating-neighbours-from-hell,News story,People power in Liverpool beating neighbours from hell,"Housing and Local Government Minister Grant Shapps and Baroness Helen Newlove, on her first visit as an adviser for the Department, have today…","Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (2018 to 2021) and The Rt Hon Grant Shapps",9 May 2011,"Housing and Local Government Minister Grant Shapps and Baroness Helen Newlove, on her first visit as an adviser for the Department, have today visited Liverpool to see what the Government can learn from a local community that has come together to defeat the bullies and troublemakers in their area.

The Government has already announced plans to tackle anti-social behaviour by social housing tenants. A package of measures will strengthen the hand of residents, councils and housing associations to take on the neighbours from hell who inflict misery and fear on their fellow tenants.

But Ministers want to go further and faster, that’s why Mr Shapps and Baroness Newlove wanted to see for themselves how an estate’s recent tenant-led approach to reduce crime and anti-social behaviour has transformed the area, improving housing and the environment, and engaging the wider community.

Housing and Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

For years, there has been an abject failure to recognise that stronger local powers for the people who manage and live in social housing are crucial for tackling anti social behaviour.

I’m determined to change this - we’ve made a good start, announcing plans to introduce a new mandatory ground for possession, so any tenant convicted of serious anti-social behaviour can be evicted much more quickly.

But much more still needs to be done. That’s why we’re here today to learn from the people on the ground how local people power can smash the scourge of anti-social behaviour in social housing. The work on the Westminster Estate shows that, rather than being the helpless victims of abuse by a disruptive minority, tenants working together and supporting each other can tackle this menace head-on and reclaim their streets.

Baroness Helen Newlove said:

I’m delighted that my first visit as adviser to the department is to see how housing tenants can work with their landlords and with each other to beat anti-social behaviour. If we don’t tackle anti-social behaviour around our housing, we’ll never be able to take back our streets and make our houses feel like homes again.

What we can see in Liverpool is that when we place decision making powers and resources in the hands of those directly affected, they can deliver real improvements on the ground.

I look forward to using what we learn today, working with ministers, to give communities and social landlords across the entire country more powers and support so they can take a firm stand against the bullies and troublemakers who blight our neighbourhoods.

Mr Shapps has already announced new local powers that will include an additional mandatory ground for possession, so those tenants with a track record of anti-social behaviour can be evicted from their council or housing association property much more quickly.

Ministers believe this will lead to a faster and fairer courts process - being found guilty of housing related anti-social behaviour in one court will provide automatic grounds for eviction in the county court, removing the need to prove the incidents of anti-social behaviour for a second time.

Mr Shapps has also announced that he will dedicate £300,000 of Government funding to a new central team to help tenants and landlords tackle the blight of neighbours from hell in their communities.

Under the recent initiative in Liverpool the landlord, Liverpool Mutual Homes, joined forces with Liverpool City Council, Merseyside Police, the Westminster Estate Tenants and Residents Association (WETRA), and the local Rathbone Youth Outreach group. Working together, the tenant-led project has helped improve services, reduce anti-social behaviour and make the area a cleaner, safer place to live.

Chief Executive at Liverpool Mutual Homes, Steve Coffey, said:

The success of Liverpool Mutual Homes’s partnership with Westminster Estate Tenants and Residents Association shows exactly what can be achieved by working closely with tenants and listening to their needs and opinions.

The estate was in poor condition and anti-social behaviour and crime levels were high but our investment programme has improved the physical appearance of homes and given people a sense of pride in their neighbourhoods.

The involvement of tenants in schemes such as the Intensive Community Payback has empowered them to take an active role in influencing the areas they live in.

We are now using this model at other our other estates across the city and I would encourage all our tenants to get involved to help us shape their communities and improve their lives.

The Minister was joined by Baroness Helen Newlove, on her first visit as an adviser for the Department, where she will continue her work as the Government’s champion for grassroots activists across the country who are working hard to make their communities safer.

The Government’s champion for Active Safer Communities, Baroness Newlove, joined the Department for Communities and Local Government in April to continue her campaign for a ‘people power’ revolution.

The Baroness is a community campaigner based in the north west and was made a peer in July 2010. Since the death of her husband Garry in 2007 in Warrington, she has worked to make communities safer and championed the cause of victims of crime.

Her report ‘Our vision for safe and active communities’ makes recommendations based on her own experiences, and those of other activists to build happier and safer neighbourhoods.

Under the Westminster Estate scheme, Westminster Estate Tenants and Residents Association members act as the first point of contact for other residents, and help resolve issues in their neighbourhood. Residents are expected to outline their priorities at monthly ‘have your say’ meetings, take responsibility for the behaviour of their family members and visitors, keep diaries of any incidents, and report issues to the relevant agency.

They also help keep communal areas tidy, controlling pets, organising activities that represent the interests of the whole community, and keeping other residents informed of their work through a quarterly newsletter.

Mr Clark said there was an even greater need for the diversity, innovation and cost savings that voluntary and community groups can offer in a tougher economic climate, and councils should look for opportunities to strengthen ties with the sector.

Praising the contribution of the voluntary sector to education, tackling worklessness, the environment and social care, Mr Clark said voluntary and community groups should have the right to challenge councils to offer a better alternative if they can do things better or more cost effectively.

The upcoming Localism Bill will entrench this powerful new right for communities to challenge the status quo and open up opportunities for new ways to do things differently.

Mr Clark said the Government expects local authorities to devolve and empower people and to maintain strong links with the voluntary sector over the coming months. He stressed that central Government wasn’t giving power to councils to then see it recentralised locally through a monopoly of local public services with voluntary and community groups - including charities, social enterprises, co-ops and housing trusts - pushed out.

Speaking at the SOLACE conference, Mr Clark said:

The spending review will inevitably present councils with some tough choices in the town hall, but councils must resist any temptation to pull the drawbridge up on the voluntary sector. We expect councils to devolve and empower people and maintain strong links with voluntary and community groups.

Right now in a tight economic climate there is a greater need for the diversity and innovation voluntary and community groups can offer. Reinforcing monopolies of local services by retrenching into the town hall is not the way forward. Opening up more of councils’ budgets to have it carried out by voluntary organisations can improve effectiveness, increase resilience and save costs.

Mr Clark made it clear that the Government’s mission to decentralise would introduce the idea of contestability - the right for communities to challenge councils to consider new ways of working.

In order for communities to be able to make real choices they needed the right to challenge the way things are being done - and to offer a better alternative.

The upcoming Localism Bill will include this powerful new right, giving communities with good ideas far greater freedom to implement their innovations, spawning imitations in other neighbourhoods when they work and sharing lessons when they don’t.

Find out about thelatest bird flu situation in England.

Avian influenza of the H5N8 strain was confirmed at a premises near Frodsham in Cheshire on Monday 2 November.

Testing today (Tuesday 3 November) has confirmed this is a highly pathogenic strain related to the virus currently circulating in Europe.

All 13,500 birds at the farm will be humanely culled to limit the spread of the disease. A 3km Protection Zone and a 10km Surveillance Zone have been put in place around the infected site to limit the risk of the disease spreading.

This case is unrelated to the H5N2 strain which was confirmed in at asmall commercial premises near Deal in Kent on Monday.

Public Health England (PHE) advises that the risk to public health from the virus is very low and the Food Standards Agency advises that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat.

Chief Veterinary Officer, Christine Middlemiss, said:

Avian flu has been confirmed at a commercial broiler breeder rearing farm near Frodsham in Cheshire. Immediate steps have been taken to limit the risk of the disease spreading and all remaining poultry at the farm will be culled.

Public Health England has confirmed that the risk to public health is very low and the Food Standards Agency advises that bird flu poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers.

Bird keepers should remain alert for any signs of disease, report suspected disease immediately and ensure they are maintaining good biosecurity on their premises.

We are urgently looking for any evidence of disease spread associated with this farm to control and eliminate it.

Dr Gavin Dabrera, Consultant in Acute Respiratory Infections at PHE said:

There have never been any confirmed cases of H5N8 in humans and the risk to public health is considered very low.

We continue to work closely with Defra throughout this investigation.

A Food Standards Agency spokesperson said:

We advise that, on the basis of the current scientific evidence, avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers.

Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, remain safe to eat.

A detailed investigation is in progress to determine the most likely source of this outbreak.

Wild birds migrating from mainland Europe during the winter period can spread the disease to poultry and other captive birds. There are some simple measures that all poultry keepers, whether they are running a large commercial farm, keeping a few hens in their back garden, or rearing game birds, should take to protect their birds against the threat of avian flu.

These include:

Supported by over £1.3 million from the European Regional Development Fund which is managed by the Department for Communities and Local Government, and match funded by Solihull Council, the North Solihull Strategic Cycle project is part of a package of activities to develop and improve the North Solihull area.

Communities Minister Baroness Hanham CBE said:

These new cycle routes will improve the environment and support struggling communities and their residents by helping individuals to access employment opportunities. This cycle network aims to help boost access to employment opportunities providing a way for people to get to and from work and improve the local economy.

Local businesses will be encouraged to embrace this eco-friendly means of travel with grants available for improving facilities for cyclists - from cycle parking to changing facilities. Assistance in setting up ‘Bike to Work’ schemes, offering a bike pool and lunch time rides to keep fit, will also be available.

This project, which is funded by the European Regional Development Fund fits well with the programme for sustainable urban development and provides support for those seeking employment.

Councillor Ian Courts, Cabinet Member for Economic Development at Solihull Council, said:

This new cycle route is another important investment that we are making into North Solihull. It underlines the commitment that we are making to improve transport options, as well as give other means of access to employment. We still have a lot of work to do to encourage more people to adopt what really is a healthy, and enjoyable, means of getting to work, but are working hard with employers to get their support on this.

377,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-common-sense-code-to-build-greener-homes,News story,New common sense code to build greener homes,Housing Minister Grant Shapps today published an improved green rating for new homes that will help deliver the next generation of green properties…,"Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (2018 to 2021) and The Rt Hon Grant Shapps",11 November 2010,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today published an improved green rating for new homes that will help deliver the next generation of green properties, which are built to the highest standards of sustainable design, and could reduce future utility bills by up to £2,250 a year in the most energy efficient homes.

The Code for Sustainable Homes was introduced in April 2007 as a standard to improve the overall sustainability of new homes. The Code scores against a star rating system, using one to six stars depending on how the property performs against categories such as energy use, waste, materials and water.

Mr Shapps said the Code has been updated to take into account the tougher new rules for energy efficiency in buildings, and help developers make new homes greener without getting bogged down in unnecessary ‘gold plated’ design features.

The Code, which has been updated after an extensive consultation with housebuilders and industry experts, will also make it easier for consumers and homeowners who want to grade the standard of their properties.

Grant Shapps said:

Over a quarter of the country’s carbon emissions come from our homes, and if we’re serious about tackling climate change we need to reduce this. So I welcome these changes to the Code that bring it in line with the tough new rules for energy efficiency in the Building Regulations.

We need greener homes, but I also want to make it easier to build the homes this country needs. Good building standards can only be effective if they are easy to understand, and only applied where they are appropriate. That’s why the Code has been updated to iron out problems that have arisen over time, and streamlined so building standards can be used in a sensible way that suits the local situation.

It’s important house builders meet the standards local communities demand, but I’m determined to simplify the complicated processes they have to go through to achieve this. That’s why I’ve pledged to tackle the ‘alphabet soup’ of standards and red tape that blight efforts to start new developments, and I will be working with industry to get this done.

The Code is rated from one to six, one being the entry level - above the level of the standard, mandatory Building Regulations - and six as highest, reflecting outstanding sustainable development.

In the first three years, nearly 8,000 homes have been completed to Code level standards. Ministers believe this figure is too low, partly because the current Code is too complicated and bureaucratic. The updated version will be a first step towards making it is easier for developers to deliver more green homes. The new Code’s green rating system has been improved by:

Aligning the Code with the latest developments in building regulations- it will now take into account, and in some cases go beyond, the tougher new Building Regulations to reduce carbon emissions from buildings. For example, a Code level 4 home will now be 25 per cent above this minimum standard. The new Code will also strongly incentivise the introduction of ‘fabric energy efficiency standards’, so developers can use building materials and techniques that improve the energy efficiency of new homes.

Streamlining the Code and associated processes- to ensure that the Code is focused on the issues of greatest significance, instead of including unnecessary standards that duplicate existing regulations or create difficulties for developers. For example, there is now an exemption from the ‘lifetime homes’ standards for sites where it is too steep to apply, and the mandatory requirement for site waste management plans has been removed since it is required by other regulations.

Resolving problems that have arisen in use of the Code- for example, clarifying parts of the Code that set standards for reducing the risk of flooding. Clear surface water management standards have now been set, enabling developers to understand exactly what is required.

The new Code will have key role in helping people cut their carbon emissions and lead more sustainable lifestyles. The standards reflect the future goals for zero carbon homes and include measures for reducing energy consumption, minimising and recycling waste, reducing potable water demand, reducing the risk and impact of flooding, reducing carbon intensive travel by providing cycle storage as well as promoting facilities for working at home. It encourages a reduction in energy through the choice of building materials as well as the energy used during the construction.

1. The Code is a voluntary standard with flexibility for developers to determine the most cost-effective mix of issues to cover to achieve any particular level, subject to a limited number of mandatory requirements to secure particular Code levels. However, it is also used as a condition by local authorities when they want to set sustainability-based planning conditions on housing developments in their area. However, before setting such a condition, planning guidance (PPS1 Supplementary Guide) currently requires authorities to undertake a full viability assessment setting out the costs to industry, and the benefits. The new Code and technical guide can be found at:www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/codeguidesummary2010.

2. Compared to the current version of the Code, the changes being introduced today could result in an overall net present value benefit to the UK economy of nearly £110m. Full details are available in the Impact Assessment which is also being published today at:www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/codeimpactassessment2010.

3. A major potential saving for developers has been made by making requirements over rainwater management more sensitive, which was proposed by many developers. This, in conjunction with other measures, could reduce the cost of constructing Code homes by up to £50m, depending on the location.

4. Average savings for householders on utility bills are set out below. In 2010, taking into account feed in tariffs, households built to Code level 6 could save between £1250 for a flat and up to £2250 for a detached house in energy and water bills.

5. Practical experience of working with the Code is also informing the development of other aspects of sustainability policy. For example the development of surface water management proposals in the current Floods and Water Management Bill.

6. The Government is committed to reduce the burden of regulation, and to reducing duplication. Future plans to review the future role of the Code are currently being considered, alongside a wider rationalisation of housing standards.

7. The rating standards in the Code are assessed against nine categories:

It is estimated that 2 million people will take part in street parties across the country on 29 April, but many may have been put off by rules and regulations imposed by councils.

Today the Prime Minister went about busting the myths associated with setting up events and encouraged all councils and organisers to use a common sense approach - sweeping away unnecessary red tape.

The Prime Minister said:

The Royal Wedding is an exciting occasion for people across Britain to come together - and one great way of doing that is by setting up a street party.

There are already around 4,000 street parties planned across Britain - and there’s still time to organise many more. We’ll be holding one in Downing Street and bringing together local people and charities.

To those councils that are asking small groups of neighbours for licenses, insurance and other bureaucracy my message is clear: don’t interfere, don’t get in the way, and don’t make problems where there are none. Let people get on and have fun.

And my message to everyone who wants to have a street party is: I’m having one and I want you to go ahead and have one too.

The Government has taken action to withdraw central guidance and worked with charities, councils and local partners to make it easier for people to organise a street party or fete. Ministers have strongly encouraged councils to do their bit to support this national day of celebration and ensure everyone’s energy goes into the fun part - not trawling through reams of paperwork.

Last August, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles tackled the reams of forms, high costs and red tape getting in the way of communities organising street parties and summer fetes. He issued new guidance and replaced the complicated bureaucracy of forms, permissions and risk assessments with a simple checklist which most local authorities are now using. He also called for a proportionate, common sense approach from councils for fun events.

Today, Mr Pickles said:

This is a real opportunity for councils to help local residents from all backgrounds to come together, and reinforce our shared identity and sense of Britishness. Of course we want people to be safe and sound but common sense has to prevail and people should use their rights as citizens and challenge councils if red tape rules are being used against them”.

In February, the Transport Secretary Philip Hammond wrote to local councils in England scrapping the Department for Transport guidance on road closures. The guidance - which was intended to cover all types of special event - was sometimes being misinterpreted by councils causing them to impose extra bureaucracy and costs on residents. Some communities were being told they would need to employ traffic management companies to close off their road when holding even small street parties. Now this guidance has been abolished, councils all over the country are encouraged to avoid charges for street party road closures.

Transport Secretary Philip Hammond said:

Local authorities should support people’s plans for Royal Wedding street parties, rather than work against them.“There should be a strong presumption in favour of allowing road closures in residential areas where appropriate alternative routes for traffic are available.“Councils should apply the lightest possible touch to administration and always think twice before charging fees. The wedding should be a great occasion for everyone across the country, let’s not let bureaucracy and form filling get in the way of a truly national celebration.”

Minister for health and safety Chris Grayling said:

The Royal Wedding will be a great national occasion, and I want to reassure everyone that they can have street parties with friends and family and bring out the bunting to celebrate in time-honoured British tradition. There is no reason whatsoever for anyone to ban these celebrations on the grounds of health and safety. We are restoring common sense to our health and safety system, ensuring it is there to protect people at work not penalise people at leisure.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended in September by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the department but I’m delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.

England’s counties, cities and boroughs continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their communities. This sense of pride and shared identity is 1 of the things that binds us together and it’s right that the government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.

Alderman Michael Bear, Lord Mayor of the City of London, said:

I am very pleased to hear that the Department for Communities and Local Government is, quite literally, flying the flag for the City of London this week. My colleagues and I are rightly proud of our City flag which flies over many buildings in the square mile - a centuries-old community with a rich and varied history.

Stuart Fraser, Chairman of Policy at the City of London Corporation said:

We are delighted for our flag to be recognised in this way. The City of London is modern and vibrant but steeped in history. It is the world’s leading financial centre at the heart of global business as well as a 24-hour metropolis.

The City of London is the oldest continuous municipal democracy in the world and predates Parliament. Its constitution is rooted in the ancient rights and privileges enjoyed by citizens before the Norman Conquest in 1066. The City of London developed a unique form of government which led to the system of parliamentary government at local and national level.

The right of the City to run its own affairs was gradually won as concessions were gained from the Crown. London’s importance as a centre of trade, population and wealth secured it rights and liberties earlier than other towns and cities. From medieval to Stuart times the City was the major source of financial loans to monarchs, who sought funds to support their policies at home and abroad. Today the Court of Common Council (100 Common Councilmen and 25 Aldermen) governs the City of London Corporation, a uniquely diverse organisation. It supports and promotes the City as the world leader in international finance and business services and provides local services and policing for those working in, living in and visiting the square mile. It also provides valued services to London and the nation.

The department is obliged to fly the European Union flag during Europe Week (week beginning 9 May) under Article 7(2) of EC Regulation 1828/2006.

The City of London flag has been kindly loaned by the Association of British Counties at no charge.

Smokers are being reminded today that careless disposal of cigarettes is the single biggest killer in house fires. Habits such as smoking whilst drinking alcohol in the home or lighting up in bed are responsible for one in three (36 per cent) of all accidental house fires resulting in deaths.

With a steady decline in the number of smokers in England, the overall number of fires triggered by cigarettes is small, but with over a third of all fire deaths in the country attributed to cigarettes the proportion of fatalities is staggering.

To coincide with National No Smoking Day (9 March 2011), the Fire Kills campaign is urging smokers to realise the deadly dangers of lighting up in the home. Smokers not giving up should still be aware of the fire risks they face, cut out dangerous habits, install smoke alarms on every level of the home and test them weekly. A working smoke alarm means you are more than twice as likely to survive an accidental house fire.

Sheila Pendlesbury sadly lost her grandson Shaun in house fire triggered by a cigarette.  She said:

Shaun was only 27 year old when he died. He had a daughter and a bright future ahead of him. His loss is something we as a family will have to live with. But it hurts enormously to know something as basic, as a working smoking alarm could have alerted him to the fire and possibly saved his life.

The Government’s Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser Sir Ken Knight said:

Without an early alarm system in place you could lose valuable escape time in a fire. Just two to three breaths of toxic smoke can render a person unconscious. As well as the health dangers, people need to be aware of the deadly risks of smoking in the home and how smoking materials can very quickly and easily lead to a fire.  When extinguishing cigarettes smokers must make sure they ‘put it out, right out’ and if possible refrain from smoking in the home at all.

For smokers not ready to kick the habit this No Smoking Day, it is important to follow these simple precautions to prevent a fire at home:

Today’s move to scrap the survey is part of concerted efforts by the new Government to release councils from Whitehall control - leaving them free to respond flexibly and effectively to the needs of their residents.

It follows the scrapping of Comprehensive Area Assessments by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles in June, instead making councils more accountable to residents rather than ministers in Whitehall.

The announcement also follows on from the new Government’s plans to require councils to publish online their spending over £500; to stop Town Hall publications which compete with local newspapers; and to block the practice of councils and quangos hiring agencies to lobby Government.

The Place Survey is a postal survey conducted by every council in England. Introduced in 2008, it involves over half a million residents and is estimated to cost more than £5 million to run.

Results have been fed back to central Government and used to measure councils’ performance on a range of centrally-imposed targets.

Fieldwork for this year’s survey was due to take place by all councils between September and December this year - but the Minister has today scrapped this to prevent the cash being diverted from vital public services.

Mr Shapps believes that the Place Survey was an example of wasteful municipal spending - which required council officials to ask residents a range of intrusive personal questions.

Grant Shapps said:

These surveys are a cosmetic exercise which never change anything. Let’s give real power back to the people - such as letting taxpayers veto high council tax rises.

The new figures bring the national total of rough sleepers to 1,768 on any given night - considerably higher than the 440 counted under the previous system.

In a change to the previous system, all councils now provide a robust estimate or a count of those sleeping rough in their area - in order to give a clearer picture of the scale of the problem in each area of the country.

And to support the work of the voluntary sector in tackling rough sleeping, the Government has announced an £18.5m package of funding for the main national homelessness charities, and extra powers for the Mayor of London to run pan-London rough sleeping services.

At the Spending Review, the Coalition Government announced a £400m investment to tackle homelessness. Whilst the majority of this funding is directed through councils to allow them to decide their priorities locally, ministers decided that there remained a compelling case for a ‘Homelessness Grant’ to be given directly to the voluntary sector.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

For too long a supposedly national figure of rough sleepers hasn’t reflected the reality on our streets. Councils and local charities know their areas best and that’s why I am putting them centre stage in assessing the true scale of the problem they face locally. By having these more accurate numbers and a better national picture of the problem - we can start to help the homeless much more effectively.

So whilst on the surface the new figures show a large jump in those sleeping on the streets, they actually reflect a more accurate way of evaluating the extent of rough sleeping. We had a situation before where large numbers of those spending the night on the street were simply being ignored, with cities like Manchester not counting in 2010 and Coventry not counting on a number of occasions.

And I have made clear that while it is vital we tackle the record Budget deficit we inherited, we must also ensure that the most vulnerable people in society are protected. This funding will strengthen the already vital role that charities play in tackling rough sleeping and enable them to provide more extensive services than would otherwise be possible”.

The Minister has also asked councils to replace Government officials on the count with representatives from Homeless Link, the national charity for all homelessness agencies. This ensures that those working directly to help people off the streets can best offer their expertise and advice, whilst providing a more consistent approach to counting rough sleepers.

And to tackle the wider issues affecting rough sleepers, Mr Shapps has brought together ministers from across eight government departments to look beyond just housing and consider employment, training, rehabilitation and healthcare.

The ministerial group on homelessness looks at areas such as better health outcomes for homeless people, through closer working between local authorities, hospitals and primary care services and the reduction of homelessness amongst ex-offenders, which is linked with re-offending in many cases.

It comes as Communities Minister Andrew Stunell visited the Broadway Centre in Hammersmith, one of the many centres across the country run by the voluntary sector, to see first-hand the vital role the sector plays in helping people off the streets and to rebuild their lives.

Today’s funding is for key national homelessness charities and for rough sleeping services across London.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

Homelessness is a very real and worrying problem in our country and charities play a key role in providing shelter, food and support to those who find themselves sleeping on the street.

Today I have seen their dedication and generosity at first hand, and how funding such as that we are announcing helps provide key support to the voluntary sector to help us meet our objectives on tackling homelessness, and the Big Society.

Crisis Chief Executive, Leslie Morphy said:

Given the current pressures facing local services and with homelessness and rough sleeping a very real issue in communities across the country at Crisis we believe it is crucial to focus on single people who are too often not a priority and help them to overcome barriers to renting privately.

Single homeless people rarely meet the criteria to acquire council accommodation and finding a flat in the private rented sector can be a complex and expensive option. They need advice and support but in many areas of the country, these specialist services are not there.

Crisis has just set up some 49 new services across England, and we warmly welcome today’s announcement of further funding for the PRS Access Development Programme which will enable us to establish such schemes in significantly more locations and secure the future of successful projects already in place.

These schemes will help people overcome financial barriers, match them to good landlords and help more individuals avoid or escape the perils of homelessness.

As London has particularly high levels of rough sleeping, and the Mayor of London has shown strong leadership on the issue, funding and oversight for all pan-London services will move to the Greater London Assembly.

The move will give them the full flexibility over delivery of their homelessness services and allow them more flexibility in meeting the Mayor’s commitment to ending rough sleeping in London by 2012.

The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said:

The Government has rightly decided that London is best placed to deliver the services it needs to end rough sleeping by 2012 and this enables us to build on the excellent work that already goes on at the borough level. We can now step up a gear in our drive to end rough sleeping in the capital for good.

2.  Previous figures were published in July 2010 which included street counts conducted between January 2009 and May 2010 and rough sleeping estimates as at June 2010:www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/roughsleepingcount2010.

The Department also issued a public consultation on evaluating the extent of rough sleeping in July 2010. A summary of the consultation responses received can be found at:www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/evaluatingroughsleepingresponse.

Following the consultation the new guidance for councils, E_valuating the extent of rough sleeping: A new approach_ was published in September 2010 and can be found at:www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/roughsleepingevaluate.

The rough sleeping statistics for autumn 2010 are the first to be published under this new guidance. The main changes under the new guidance are

At the Spending Review, the Coalition Government announced a £400m investment to tackle homelessness. This includes £326m in grants for local authorities, and £74m for the voluntary sector.

Crisis is the national charity for single homeless people dedicated to ending homelessness by delivering life-changing services and campaigning for change. The Crisis PRS (private rented sector) Access Development Programme was launched in 2009-2010 to help single homeless people find and sustain good quality accommodation in the private rented sector (PRS). Building on over 10 years experience in this area, Crisis provided funding and support to 49 community based projects which will assist over 1,500 people into sustainable accommodation. This project is funded by the DCLG and supported by the Ministry of Justice, Homeless Link and the National Landlords Association.

Ministers have signalled the end to top-down regeneration, which they argue pitted neighbour against neighbour and forced developments on communities that did not want them.

Instead, the Government is looking to devolve a wide range of powers from Whitehall to Town Halls - putting residents, local businesses, local authorities and civil society organisations in the driving seat and providing them with rewards and incentives to drive local regeneration and growth.

These include:

In addition to this, councils will be able to raise additional funds to invest in their local area through the New Homes Bonus, where central Government will match the council tax raised from new homes built and empty homes brought back into use for the first six years.

Local people will work with councils to decide what to spend the extra money on - whether council tax discounts for local residents, boosting frontline services like rubbish collection or providing local facilities like swimming pools and leisure centres. This will mean that for the first time, communities will be able to see the benefits of development in their area for themselves.

Visiting the Baytree Renewal Area in Manchester, Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

I want to see an end to the centrally-imposed regeneration regime which pitted neighbour against neighbour and forced developments on communities that did not want them.

That’s why we’re shifting the balance in favour of communities themselves, untying the hands of councils and residents so they can make the key decisions over how they would like to improve their own neighbourhoods.

Baytree is a great example of this. Local residents working with the Council to ensure that their views were factored into renewal work, and that the wishes of residents - more green spaces, improved security, and action on speeding vehicles and crime - were taken account of.

And with the New Homes Bonus offering powerful incentives for growth, councils will have the opportunity to invest these additional funds in their local area, while residents themselves will for the first time see the benefits of development for themselves.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

Communities must no longer face instructions from central Government on regenerating their local areas, but must be free to take the lead and decide for themselves. That’s why we’re devolving a wide range of powers to councils and their residents alike.

The New Homes Bonus is a key component of this. For the first time, residents will have an incentive to give the green light to new developments in their area, and the extra Government funding they attract will be available for them to use as they see fit.

And neighbourhoods blighted by empty homes and the anti-social behaviour they attract can also benefit from extra Government cash by bringing these properties back into use for families in need.

Today, Mr Shapps and Mr Stunell have also confirmed a further £5 million funding to encourage the newly-formed Local Enterprise Partnerships and new Local Authority partnerships to work together across boundaries to deliver large scale housing and regeneration schemes in key growth and Housing Market Renewal locations.

These extra freedoms and flexibilities sit alongside nearly £20 billion investment in growth and regeneration from central Government, through new infrastructure projects. This includes:

Jackie Sadek, Chief Executive of UK Regeneration, said:

We are delighted that the Government has set out a clear and very simple framework for regeneration. In keeping with its drive on localism the Government is focusing on enabling measures and a few key strategic interventions on transport. This offers all of us a challenge: taking this framework, with limited resources, and making things happen across the country. UK Regeneration is leading that drive.

Despite the need to cut the deficit, the Government will spend £2.1 billion on the Decent Homes programme to make much-needed improvements to council and housing association homes.

And new figures published today show the Government ahead of schedule to deliver the improvements that tenants need and deserve.

The numbers of non decent council homes fell by more than a quarter over the past year. Councils have fitted 110,000 new kitchens, 82,000 new bathrooms and 126,000 new central heating systems into their properties.

This dramatic fall now means that 93 per cent of all social homes now meet the Decent standard - more than the 92 per cent predicted a year ago, and up from 90 per cent of all homes in 2009.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

When we came to Government we pledged to protect the most vulnerable and committed to improving damp and cold homes.

I am delighted to see such rapid and impressive progress towards ensuring that all social homes are at the standard that tenants deserve and rightly expect.

Today’s figures demonstrate how councils and housing associations are ahead of schedule in delivering the much-needed improvements to their stock.

And because we’re spending over £2 billion on this vital programme, I fully expect to see the numbers of refurbished properties rise further over the next few years so that more families benefit from the vast improvements to their homes that they have waited so long for.

In an innovative new deal between the Government and NHBC, Ministers will have access to a wealth of information on the ins and outs of housebuilding - from details of the materials used to build a home, to insights on the journey from the start of the construction process through to the final sale.

NHBC provides warranties for over 80 per cent of the UK’s new-build homes. Mr Shapps said that by extending the scope of information they provide, the Government will be able to drill down into the fine detail of the house-building process and understand how government can help to enable the delivery of the homes the country needs.

The Government has already taken strong action to help unblock the property pipeline. The £400 million Get Britain Building Fund will restart stalled developments while the Mortgage Indemnity Scheme helps first time buyers find the funds they need to buy newly built homes.

But by sharing the insights of these housing market experts, Mr Shapps believes many more stumbling blocks could be overcome.

Information that could be shared by NHBC includes:

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

As we look to get Britain building again, we’ve taken decisive action to bring down the barriers to building with help to get stalled projects back on track, incentives for councils to build and extra support for first-time buyers.

But there’s always more to be done and that’s why I’m asking the experts to help us know exactly how the market ticks. NHBC have long worked closely with Government to ensure our numbers are as accurate as possible. I know that today’s new partnership will broaden and deepen both our understandings of cause and effect in the housing market and bring new ideas and insights to the fore.

Imtiaz Farookhi, Chief Executive of NHBC said:

NHBC works closely with the Government to support the delivery of high quality sustainable new homes for homeowners across the country.

We are delighted to agree this new partnership to provide a vast range of detailed information.

High quality data plays such an important role helping the Government to assess the progress of its housing programme. Our partnership will support this and help deliver more quality new homes that the country desperately needs.

The National House Building Council already contributes data toward the Department’s National Statistics on house building.

Cycling is fast becoming a national obsession - Great Britain’s cycling team shone at the Beijing Olympics with 14 medals and are looking to repeat their success at London’s 2012 Games, while more and more people are getting on their bikes for an exercising and eco-friendly commute to work.

But all too often their routes are diverted onto busy roads and highways, by outdated byelaws that restrict access to parks, promenades and other public spaces.

Red tape puts the brakes on efforts to remove byelaws, as councils are required to first seek permission from Government Ministers.

So today, Mr Shapps has confirmed that he will give the green light for councils to revoke any byelaws they no longer want or need without any Whitehall interference - helping to move their plans to support cyclists up a gear.

He argued that councils know their areas best and will therefore know how best to maintain their local public spaces so they are safe and accessible not just to cyclists but to all sections of the community - and that they should be free to make the necessary measures to cut red tape without first having to seek Whitehall’s permission. But as part of the Government’s aim to avoid creating additional bureaucracy, Ministers will put in place checks and balances to ensure any new byelaws put forward by councils do not impose unnecessary or excessive burdens.

With these new powers planned, the Minister called on communities to get on their bikes and follow the lead already set by councils across the country that have already amended their byelaws to open up new cycle routes. These include:

Grant Shapps said:

This Bank Holiday, and over the course of the next week, thousands of budding Chris Hoys and Victoria Pendletons will be getting on their bikes and making the most of the half term holidays.

I want to make sure they can cycle in safety and where appropriate use the local parks, promenades and public spaces but all too often unnecessary, unwanted and outdated byelaws instead force them onto nearby busy roads.

This Government has already been taking the stabilisers off councils and trusting them to do what’s right for their area - and now, I am giving them the freedom to revoke whatever byelaws they need to in order to crank up their efforts and make their local areas safer for cyclists.

As part of the Kingdom of East Anglia that was first settled by the Angles in the 5th century, Suffolk has a rich history. A county of great archaeological importance, Suffolk is renowned for archaeological finds from the Stone Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. Recently it is the home of some of Britain’s finest agricultural produce and to iconic companies like the Greene King brewery and Birds Eye peas. Suffolk’s picturesque countryside is known as ‘Constable Country’ and the county was the birthplace of both John Constable and Thomas Gainsborough - 2 of Britain’s best regarded painters.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

England’s counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together.

The historic English counties are 1 of the oldest forms of local government in western Europe. Their roots run deep. And no amount of administrative reshuffling can delete these longstanding and cherished local identities.

Mark Bee, Suffolk County Council’s Leader, said:

Suffolk is without a doubt one of the most beautiful corners of this country - so it’s fantastic to be about to share it, and be proud of it, by flying our flag over the Department for Communities and Local Government. We take huge pride in Suffolk’s rural charm, vibrant towns and its community-spirited way of life and would urge anyone to come and see it for themselves.

The Government is freeing-up cities from the control of Whitehall to unlock their potential as engines of growth through a series of ‘city deals’ from the spring, giving them the powers they need to attract private sector investment, create new jobs, and rebalance the economy.

In return, cities must guarantee that they can provide strong and accountable leadership, improve efficiency and outcomes, and be innovative in their approach.

Negotiations on the first wave of deals have already started with England’s eight largest cities outside of London: Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield.

Today Greg Clark announced he was extending the offer of a bespoke city deal to more of England’s cities, beyond the main ones, and invited them to start considering their proposals.

An initial menu of possible transformative powers, including greater freedoms to invest in growth, and new ways for cities to boost jobs and apprenticeships, were set out inUnlocking Growth in Cities, published in December. The Government’s Cities Unit will lead the negotiation process on behalf of Whitehall.

Greg Clark said:

The battle for economic growth - for Britain’s future, will be won or lost in our cities. Right now our cities face serious challenges, but what isn’t in doubt is their huge potential to drive economic growth. The key to unlocking that potential is a new deal for cities. Giving cities the powers, control over resources, and funding they need to fire on all cylinders and attract the private sector investment needed to rebalance the economy. But this revival will depend on all of Britain’s cities, not just the few. That’s why today I am inviting more cities to consider the vision they have for their community and the deal they need to make it happen.

We are turning the established order on its head and cities must come to Whitehall not as supplicants, as in the past, but as equal participants in an open and constructive deal making process.

Cities will need to make a clear case for new powers, backed with evidence and a strong economic rationale. And where Whitehall wants to retain control the burden will be on central Government to explain why it is necessary.

City deals are the next step in Government’s plans to grow local economies. Local Enterprise Partnerships are already encouraging local leaders to think and work together in ways that reflect their true economic geography. And the Regional Growth Fund and Enterprise Zones support the idea that local economies should be in the driving seat in encouraging entrepreneurs and private investment.

Following the closing day for submitting local enterprise partnership proposals the Government confirmed that it has received 56 proposals from across the country.

Ministers have been impressed by many of the proposals which are radical in their approach. They identify the variety of challenges facing individual local economies and put forward innovative ways of tackling them - reflecting the importance of allowing local areas to determine their own economic development and drive private sector job growth.

The Government is keen to see partnerships remain proactive and maintain momentum. Over the coming weeks Ministers will consider the proposals in detail, looking at how they will support economic growth, before providing feedback to partnerships ahead of the publication of the White Paper on sub-national economic growth and the introduction of the Localism Bill.

Tackling the debt crisis and rebalancing the economy are urgent national priorities.

Local enterprise partnerships can rewrite the economic geography of the country - unconstrained by arbitrary boundaries of Regional Development Agencies and the top-down prescription approach taken previously. Proposals include partnerships that cut across existing regional boundaries and include universities or community groups among them.

Eric Pickles said:

These 56 local enterprise partnership proposals are just the beginning of a new radical way of delivering prosperity and rebalancing the economy.

We are facing economic problems that need solutions from local communities. The secret to the success of local enterprise partnerships will be working on the basis of local economic geography - gone are the artificial political regions of RDAs - this will better serve the needs of local business.

The bureaucracy of Regional Development Agencies gave local authorities little reason to engage creatively with economic issues. Local enterprise partnerships are a way of tying council and business interests together, and creating the conditions for business to thrive and prosper.

Vince Cable said:

Business leadership in local enterprise partnerships is critical. Mark Prisk and I have met many leading groups including the CBI, the Institute of Directors, the Federation of Small Businesses, and the British Chambers of Commerce who have all contributed their thoughts to how it should work. It is clear that there must be genuine partnership between business and local government and that local enterprise partnerships should be practical bodies for promoting enterprise, not talking shops.

Trade and investment promotion, sector leadership, innovation, business support and access to finance will in future be led nationally, though with devolved local management in many cases. This still leaves huge scope for local initiatives to promote enterprise. The outcome will vary just as local economic priorities differ across the country. In some areas, there might be a focus on skills. In others, local enterprise partnerships may help set priorities for planning and infrastructure decisions. The key is that these partnerships are built from the bottom-up and will have the flexibility to determine their own agenda, rather than have it handed down to them by Whitehall.

Yesterday was also the closing date for the consultation on the Regional Growth Fund. Announced in the Budget, the £1bn fund will provide support for projects that offer significant potential for sustainable economic growth and can create new private sector jobs. The two-year fund will particularly help areas that have been traditionally reliant on the public sector make the transition to private sector growth and prosperity. Proposals for funding will be sought from private organisations and public-private partnerships, and local enterprise partnerships will have a key role to play in coordinating bids across areas and communities.

Around 350 responses to the consultation were received, from organisations including trade associations, business groups, local authorities, universities and, environmental bodies, setting out their views on how the Fund can be designed to best meet the needs of local areas and communities. The Government’s response to those views and further criteria for funding proposals will be set out in the forthcoming White Paper.

They will join Chair-designate Julian Ashby in overseeing regulation of the social housing sector from 1 April 2012, when responsibility for this vitally important function transfers to the Homes and Communities Agency.

The Secretary of State said:

We are committed to robust regulation of the social housing sector, and this is a strong committee which I am confident will ensure that task is delivered. It is right that as the Committee members establish the Regulation function at the Homes and Communities Agency, they should focus on the economic viability, good governance and value for money of Registered Providers.

We have chosen to appoint a highly skilled Committee while retaining the flexibility to assess and address any emerging challenges as the new Regulatory Framework is implemented.

Julian Ashby said:

I am delighted to be joined on the Committee by four such capable people. They bring a range of expertise in their respective fields, including fresh perspectives from other areas of regulation as well as those with substantial experience in social housing. It includes strong financial, commercial and economic expertise which will be essential for the Committee’s core role of economic regulation. Together we will ensure effective independent regulation of social housing that is robust, transparent and commands the confidence of the sector, its lenders and other stakeholders.

Key staff will transfer from the Tenant Services Authority on 1 April 2012, ensuring continuity on ongoing casework. As part of the Homes and Communities Agency, the new Committee will oversee implementation of the new regulatory framework.

The Homes and Communities Agency Regulation Committee is a statutory committee of the Homes and Communities Agency, created by virtue of the Localism Act 2011. It will assume full powers and responsibilities from 1 April 2012, following abolition of the Tenant Services Authority.

Piers Williamsonis Chief Executive of the Housing Finance Company, a not-for-profit organisation that raises market finance for registered providers. He brings a wealth of financial services and banking experience along with over nine years experience of the social housing sector. Piers has also held non-executive Board roles at the Co-operative Bank and Insurance Society.

Jane Maywith recent regulatory experience as a Board member of OFWAT and the Office of Rail Regulation, Jane also has commercial experience as Customer Services Director of Thames Water.

Richard Moriartyis currently Director of Economic Regulation at the Civil Aviation Authority, and was previously Director of Regulation at the Tenants Services Authority, and has additional regulatory experience at Postcomm, Ofgem and Ofgas.

So I welcome that this important element of assessment of Kickstart housing projects is now finally publicly available. This is the right thing to do and something I strongly agree with. Government needs to lead by example so this is a necessary step in opening up all public records.

The Kickstart Programme was run by the Homes and Communities Agency, and offered Government funding to get work restarted on housing developments stalled by the economic downturn. As part of this, CABE were commissioned to assess the design of projects awarded Kickstart funding against their Building for Life standard. Details of the Building for Life standard can be found at:http://www.buildingforlife.org/about(external link).

The Building for Life scores are part of a wider report published today by the Homes and Communities Agency on the lessons learnt from the Kickstart housing delivery programme. A copy of the Kickstart review of Round 2 and a full list of the Building for Life Assessments is available at:http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk(external link).

A review of Round 1 Kickstart schemes was published by the HCA on 16 December 2009 and can be found at:http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/public/documents/Kickstart_Round _1_Review.pdf(PDF, 76 KB, external link).

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

This year is particularly significant in that the Middlesex Regiment’s battle at Albuhera took place on 16 May 1811 and this week marks the 200th anniversary of one of the bravest acts of chivalry and courage ever witnessed by a regiment of the British army when ‘The Diehards’ took on and held back the might of Napoleon in the Peninsula Wars. This is why 16 May was chosen as Middlesex Day.

Eric Pickles said:

England’s counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together.

Middlesex retains its place in people’s memories and affections, despite attempts to wipe it off the map. The historic English counties are 1 of the oldest forms of local government in western Europe. Their roots run deep. And no amount of administrative reshuffling can delete these longstanding and cherished local identities.

John Randall MP said:

I am absolutely delighted that the Department of Communities and Local Government has been recognising our historic British counties. For those of us fortunate to be from Middlesex to see our county flag flying bravely on Middlesex Day from a government building is a great moment. This will show that although the county is no longer an administrative county it is very much still a part of our nation. We can celebrate too the exploits of those brave men who fought 200 years ago at the Battle of Albuhera and our flag will help to keep their proud memory and our county’s history alive for future generations.

Middlesex county campaigner and author of ‘The Real Counties of Great Britain’, Russell Grant said:

Middlesex was first founded in Saxon documentation in 704 AD in a geographical description of Twickenham as being in Middlesex. Since local government counties were only created in 1889, it is a pity that over a thousand years of local heritage and national history of our counties, such as Middlesex, is lost because of a lack of a short-lived County Council. Of course, the County of Middlesex - an entirely separate and different entity - continues to exist as it has done for 1,300 years but the lack of understanding of modern media and by-passing of local history in our schools has created an historical and geographical vacuum. We hope, in time, our government will right the wrongs of previous administrations by protecting the identity and integrity of our counties that are at the very fabric of our English nationhood.

The Middlesex flag has been kindly loaned by the Association of British Counties at no charge.

Find out about thelatest bird flu situation in England.

Avian influenza of the H5N2 strain has been confirmed in at a small commercial premises near Deal in Kent today (2 November).

All 480 birds on site will be humanely culled to limit the spread of the disease. A 1km Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) Restricted Zone has also been put in place around the infected farm to limit the risk of the disease spreading.

The advice from Public Health England (PHE) is that the risk to public health from the virus is very low and the Food Standards Agency has made clear that bird flu does not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers. Thoroughly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat.

Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said:

Avian flu has been confirmed at a small commercial premises in Kent. Immediate steps have been taken to limit the risk of the disease spreading and all remaining poultry and captive birds at the farm will be culled.

Public Health England has confirmed that the risk to public health is very low and the Food Standards Agency has said that bird flu does not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers. There will be no impact on food supply as this business does not supply poultry meat or eggs to the commercial food chain.

Bird keepers should remain alert for any signs of disease, report suspected disease immediately and ensure they are maintaining good biosecurity on their premises.

We are urgently looking for any evidence of disease spread associated with this farm to control and eliminate it.

Dr Gavin Dabrera, Consultant in Acute Respiratory Infections at PHE, said:

Avian influenza remains an uncommon infection in humans and the risk to the UK population remains very low – we will continue working with Defra and the local Health Protection Team to monitor the situation closely.

Do not touch any sick or dead birds and make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap after contact with any animal.

A Food Standards Agency spokesperson said:

The Food Standard Agency advises that, on the basis of the current scientific evidence, this strain of avian influenza does not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers.

The wider risk posed by avian influenzas through the food chain is very low.

Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, remain safe to eat.

A detailed investigation is in progress to determine the most likely source of this outbreak.

Wild birds migrating from mainland Europe during the winter period can spread the disease to poultry and other captive birds. There are some simple measures that all poultry keepers, whether they are running a large commercial farm, keeping a few hens in their back garden, or rearing game birds, should take to protect their birds against the threat of avian flu.

These include:

The UK has remained free of highly pathogenic avian influenza since September 2017. A low pathogenic H5N3 strain of the disease, which poses no threat to human health, returned in December 2019 and was quickly dealt with by Government action. The UK declared itself free from avian influenza H5N3 in June.

395,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/next-phase-of-local-public-audit,News story,Next phase of local public audit,Local Government Minister Grant Shapps today published the next steps on the road to a more efficient and accountable local audit system that…,"Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (2018 to 2021) and The Rt Hon Grant Shapps",4 January 2012,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps today published the next steps on the road to a more efficient and accountable local audit system that will replace the Audit Commission’s centralised inspection regime.

The Government is today publishing its proposals for the new arrangements for audit of local public bodies.

Following the decision to abolish the Audit Commission, the Government sought views last year on a new, more transparent and accountable local public audit framework that would both reduce the cost of public audit and maintain high standards of scrutiny over public money.

The Government will now begin a period of intense discussion with councils and audit firms so they can shape the practical details of the new, localised audit system. A series of workshops with council finance experts will begin this month.

The Government intends to bring forward legislation to formally close down the Audit Commission and introduce the new framework as soon as Parliamentary time allows. A draft Bill will be published for pre-legislative scrutiny in the Spring.

The new framework will free local bodies to appoint their own independent auditors from an open and competitive market. It will be based on the private sector audit model with transparent regulation overseen by the Financial Reporting Council and the National Audit Office. Separate arrangements will be developed for smaller bodies like parish councils.

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

Today we are taking another step down to road to replacing expensive centralised local public audit with a more streamlined and competitive local audit structure. Councils are already showing they can be open and accountable - publishing details on their day to day business from spending to structure and taking control of their own auditing affairs.

The plans set out today will see Whitehall take another step back so that councils can begin to take ownership of their new audit system. Robust and independent external audit will continue. We want councils to be part of how we create a better, more efficient and transparent audit service that offers best value for money and properly serves taxpayers.

In addition, as the Audit Commission is wound down the Government will put in place suitable transitional arrangements.

The Audit Commission is currently in the process of outsourcing its in-house audit practice. The contracts will start from 2012-13 and are expected to run for three to five years to ensure best value for money and give local bodies the time to plan for appointing their own auditors.

Once these outsourced contracts have been awarded the Commission will further downsize in readiness for final closure. This smaller body will be responsible for overseeing the contract period after which the new arrangements will come into effect.

Vernon Soare, Executive Director of Professional Standards at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), said:

The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales understands the importance of the proper stewardship of tax payers’ money by local public bodies and the need to provide good value and effective public services to citizens. We welcome the publication of the proposals and the clarity over the next steps. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales will continue to assist the Department for Communities and Local Government with its work on the new public audit regime.

1. The Government Response to the Consultation on the Future of Local Audit is available on the Department for Communities and Local Government website at:www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/localauditgovresponse. The consultation ran from March to June 2011. Over 450 responses were received, mostly from local bodies and their representative bodies.

2. While the new arrangements are being finalised, the Audit Commission is in parallel outsourcing the audit work currently done in-house. This means all audits will be done by private firms from 2012-13, with regulation and guidance still overseen by the Commission until the new regime takes effect. This will allow the Audit Commission to become smaller and more streamlined, minimising costs to local bodies in this transitional period. The Department will be seeking views from local bodies on whether the outsourcing contracts should last for three or five years. The new arrangements will come into effect at the end of those contracts.

3. The Deaprtment for Communities and Local Government is working closely with smaller bodies, particularly their representative groups such as the National Association of Local Councils and the Society of Local Council Clerks, to identify the most proportionate and effective framework for the sector. Peter Lacey, of the National Association of Local Councils, and Steve Parkinson of the Society of Local Council Clerks said: ”We look forward to working with the Department for Communities and Local Government over the coming months to achieve proportionate and cost-effective arrangements for the 9,900 smaller bodies in England.”

4. Ministers will ask Parliament to approve a new role for the National Audit Office, producing the Code of Practice and supporting guidance to set out the framework for the audit of local public bodies. The National Audit Office will consult key partners in developing a risk-based and proportionate approach to the value for money element of local public audit.

5. The Financial Reporting Council will be the overall regulator, mirroring its role under the Companies Act 2006. The Financial Reporting Council will be responsible for recognition and supervision of Recognised Supervisory Bodies (professional accountancy bodies responsible for supervising the work of auditors, and for putting rules and arrangements in place which their members must fulfil before they can be registered auditors, monitoring the quality of audits, and investigating complaints, disciplinary cases etc.)

6. The Accountancy and Actuarial Disciplinary Board (part of the Financial Reporting council) investigates significant public interest disciplinary cases and can impose sanctions on those auditors found guilty of misconduct in both the companies and public sectors. It will continue to exercise these powers in regard to local public audit.

7. Local public bodies will have a duty to appoint an auditor from the register of local public auditors, on the advice of an Independent Auditor Appointment Panel. The appointment process will be transparent. Local public bodies will be required to publish details of the auditor appointment on their website within 28 days of making the appointment, together with the Independent Audit Appointment Panel’s advice and, if they did not follow that advice, a statement explaining why. We intend to work with the sector to produce guidance which would set out how the responsibilities of the Independent Audit Appointment Panel could be exercised.

8. The Government Response sets out how the proposed new arrangements might need to be flexed for different local public bodies such as Police and Crime Commissioners or Passenger Transport Executives. Audit arrangements for local health bodies (such as the Clinical Commissioning Groups proposed in the Health and Social Care Bill before Parliament) are not included. The detailed arrangements will be specified in due course.

9. Local public bodies will be required to appoint an auditor by 31 December in the year preceding the financial year to be audited, and notify the Secretary of State if they have not done so. The Secretary of State will be able to direct the local public body to appoint an auditor or make the auditor appointment directly. In addition to meeting the cost of the appointment the local public body could be subject to a sanction for failing to make the appointment.

10. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales is likely to play a key role in the new framework as a Recognised Supervisory Body, building on the similar role it already plays in relation to audit in the private sector (alongside several other organisations who are also designated as Recognised Supervisory Bodies).

The relaunch of the radio adverts hails the beginning of a new approach for the campaign with an increased focus on partnership and the Big Society.

Nine out of ten households across the country now own a smoke alarm according to the most recent English Housing Survey - up from 74 per cent in 2001. However it’s important to remember that ownership is nothing without regular maintenance. One in four of these alarms is likely to fail in a house fire because it is clogged, broken, or most often because the battery is flat or has been removed.

With that in mind, this weekend will see the return of a targeted ‘Don’t drown in toxic smoke’ radio campaign. Timed to play at weekends when people are more likely to tackle household tasks, the ads will play on local radio stations to remind the public to check their smoke alarm.

Fire Kills is also calling on the Big Society to fly the flag for fire safety, asking communities, authorities, businesses, and the fire safety industry itself to find new and innovative ways of spreading the message. All smoke alarm manufacturers in England already promote the Fire Kills message on their products and we’re asking the industry to go even further.

Fire Minister Bob Neill said:

Every death through accidental house fire is a tragedy that could be easily avoided in the modern world. Checking your smoke alarm is a simple, lifesaving step, and it’s a simple message to pass on. I urge everyone to get involved with the Fire Kills campaign and help spread the word.

Government’s Chief Fire & Rescue Adviser Sir Ken Knight said:

Even with nine out of ten of England’s households owning a smoke alarm it’s still vital to check it works. Just two to three breaths of toxic smoke could render you unconscious, and you have less than two minutes to escape a fire before you can’t breathe.

The Big Society will have a huge role to play in spreading the fire safety message alongside the Fire Kills adverts. Everyone from individuals to big business has the potential for innovative new ideas to reinforce the work of the Fire and Rescue Service and advertising, helping to transform the Fire Kills campaign into a national movement.

1. The Fire Kills campaign is the national fire safety campaign delivered by Communities and Local Government. The campaign aims to reduce the number of deaths and injuries caused by accidental dwelling fires by actively encouraging people to change their behaviour and attitudes towards fire safety.

The average house price in rural areas is £250,000, yet the average salary is only £21,000 a year, meaning many local people struggle to get on the housing ladder. Mr Stunell wants to see farmers identify disused farm buildings that could be converted into new affordable homes for local people, and wants councils to look favourably on their planning applications.

Mr Stunell highlighted a scheme run by Harrogate Borough Council that requires developers to make provision on the site for affordable housing, resulting in 34 extra affordable homes across 19 sites.

Mr Stunell believes that other rural councils can learn from Harrogate’s example, and wants to see other councils work with their communities to deliver the homes they need.

Harrogate’s approach is in the spirit of the “Home on the Farm” idea, championed by Mr Stunell, which promotes conversion of disused farm buildings into new homes.

Andrew Stunell said:

Councils and rural communities need to think innovatively and outside the box to make sure they deliver the homes they need.

The work by Harrogate Borough Council shows what can be done when a local authority thinks imaginatively about its affordable housing needs, and uses all the powers they have at their disposal.

And with the measures announced in the Housing Strategy, the New Homes Bonus, FirstBuy, plus Neighbourhood Plans on the way from April 2012, the Coalition is making sure that councils have even more tools to get the job done.

I’d like to congratulate Harrogate, and call on other rural councils to look at their example, and see what else they can do to work with local farmers and their communities to convert their disused buildings and deliver a home on the farm.

Councillor Jean Butterfield, Cabinet Member for Housing, said:

This is the most practical way of implementing the rural building conversion policy so that we can help bring redundant buildings back into use as much-needed homes. Barn conversions can make extremely large high-value houses. Our policy encourages a more flexible way of looking at these buildings, creating more types and size of house including affordable homes for local people.

A total of 34 affordable homes associated with rural building conversions have been delivered on 19 sites and we currently have four more under way. Every rural affordable home added to our stock is desperately needed and helps local people to stay in communities where they work or where they grew up.

Harrogate Borough Council’s Discounted Home Ownership scheme allows the purchaser to buy at a discount of 65 per cent of the market value which is then protected in perpetuity.

As an example, Wilstrop Lodge Farm built two large units at market value and two smaller, affordable units. The market value homes sold for £500,000. The affordable homes sold at the discounted sale price of £60,000.

The average rural house price is now £250,000 and the average salary only £21,000.

Separately, the Government has announced as part of the Autumn statement, that it intends to consult on proposals to allow existing agricultural buildings to be used for other business purposes, such as offices, leisure and retail space, to make it easier for rural business to find the premises they need to expand.

Despite a tough Spending Review, the Government announced the capital investment to help towards completing the Decent Homes programme in the council housing sector.

Announcing the outcome of the bidding process, Mr Shapps said that 50 local authorities will benefit from funding, protecting some of the most vulnerable people in our society.

The bids submitted by local authorities had to go through a rigorous assessment process undertaken by the Homes and Communities Agency to ensure that maximum value for money for the taxpayer and maximum benefit for the country’s council housing tenants.

Successful bids were those where the authority made a strong case for investment need and had already demonstrated significant cost reductions - where this is the case the authority has been awarded levels of funding close to their bid.

The funding will help tackle the backlog of non-Decent homes in preparation for the introduction of a new fairer system of council house financing.

The self-financing proposal, which is a key measure of the Localism Bill currently before Parliament, will put councils firmly in control of managing their housing stock and bring an end to the Housing Revenue Account subsidy system. This offers the best way of maintaining the country’s social housing stock as councils will be able to manage their finances over the long term rather than on a year by year basis.

Grant Shapps said:

To reflect our commitment to fairness and protecting the most vulnerable people in our society, we set aside over £2bn at the Spending Review to bring as many social homes as we can up to scratch - this was despite the tough decisions we took to tackle the record deficit.

£1.6bn of the funding is for council homes, and some 50 local authorities will benefit from this funding - allowing them to improve around 150,000 houses. Too many families live in non-decent accommodation, so I am pleased that so many of them will see a difference to due this funding.

I have already announced my intention to give councils and communities the power to manage their own stock through a system of self-financing - bringing new freedoms and flexibilities and greater efficiency savings. This funding will help ready those councils facing the most difficulties in tackling the non-decent homes on their books.

Pat Ritchie, chief executive of the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) said:

These allocations will make a significant impact in local communities and is good news for the tenants who will benefit from improvements to their homes. At the HCA our involvement does not end with this investment, and we will now work with councils and other landlords to maximise the impact of funding through our enabling role.

Speaking at a special self-build workshop for local authority Leaders in London, Mr Prisk said that the first projects would benefit from over £1.1million to start work on up to 20 self-build plots.

Following final checks and approvals, the applications in North East Derbyshire and Peterborough will be the first to receive the funding, which provides short-term finance to help unlock projects where groups of self-build homes are built at the same time.

The Minister, along with self-build industry champion, architecture specialist and presenter of Channel 4’s Grand Designs Kevin McCloud, hosted the workshop for local authority Leaders in association with the Local Government Association, to discuss how they could support prospective self builders in their area.

A specialist team from Almere in the Netherlands also attended to share their expertise. Almere, near Amsterdam, is the largest low-cost self-build experiment in Europe, which has grown rapidly in recent years.

Earlier this year the former Housing Minister travelled to Almere with a delegation from the UK self-build industry, and hosted an event with Dutch Government officials and business leaders at the British Embassy to boost trade and links between Dutch and British businesses.

Mr Prisk said that there had been a great surge of interest in recent years for self-build, and it was now important that local authorities learnt from abroad and local projects to identify opportunities for self-build development in their plans, and to give people in their area the opportunity to build their own home.

Housing Minister Mark Prisk said:

Across the country, more people than ever want control over the design and build of their home. But these types of projects have often been held back because of limited land availability, reluctance by lenders to provide finance and red tape. So I’m delighted that the first self-build projects in Derbyshire and Peterborough have been earmarked for Government cash.

This money will be repaid as plots are sold, and I hope it will demonstrate to lenders, investors and the development industry that these types of projects are worth backing. But it’s not just about money, self builders and developers need the support of local authorities to get these projects off the ground. So I’m pleased we have the team from Almere to share their expertise, and I urge local authorities to learn from their example and help more self builders achieve their dreams.

Kevin McCloud said:

I’m delighted to attend this event today with the new Housing Minister and welcome the first approvals for cash from the Government’s £30million investment fund which will help drive activity in the sector and give more people the opportunity to build their own home. But it is not just about cash, we need to see more support from local authorities if we’re serious about making self build a mainstream housing option. And I hope we can draw inspiration from the projects like Almere, and many others across Europe, about what is achievable with strong local leadership and vision.

Approval for the first custom build homes funding application with a value of £450,000 has been given to a developer in North East Derbyshire on a site at Morton for nine self-build plots. A second application for 11 self-build plots with a loan value of approximately £725,000 for a site in Peterborough has also been approved. Both approvals are subject to final due diligence and contract.  Details will be available once final due diligence checks have been finalised and contracts agreed.

A further application for funding has been received for a multi-unit self build development on a site in Derbyshire and the Homes and Communities Agency is in discussion with several other project promoters who are seeking to apply for funding with more applications expected before the end of the year.

Details of the funding Custom Build Homes fund can be found at:www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/ourwork/custom-build(external link).

The £30million fund will be available over the next three years (2012 to 2015). Funding is available to cover the cost of building, land acquisition or other costs associated with a proposed development of five or more custom build homes with planning permission. The funding is available to eligible applicants bringing forward projects in England with the exception of London.

A Year of Service is a unique programme where nine faith communities are leading a series of volunteering days throughout the year, encouraging people of all faiths and people of non-religious beliefs to come together to help improve their local neighbourhoods. This first event is being led by the Baha’i Faith, where representatives of the nine faith communities are joining young people wrapping donated gifts for a London homeless shelter.

As highlighted in the Government’s Creating the Conditions for Integration paper published last week, A Year of Service exemplifies the principle of selfless service to others and is an opportunity to mark the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in a practical way - service being an important theme of Her Majesty’s long reign. Each of the days is focusing on a different social action project, such as community clean ups, planting trees in a local park, or cooking lunches for those in need.

The private sector is invited to get involved and business-led charity Business in the Community (BiTC) is encouraging businesses across the country to support A Year of Service.

Also announced today is a new category in the national Faith Through a Lens photography competition, which this year will feature photographs taken by a Year of Service volunteers, celebrating their achievements of volunteers and capturing the wide range of activities that will take place during the year.

Speaking ahead of the launch at the National Baha’i Centre, Eric Pickles said:

A Year of Service is a wonderful celebration of the practical contribution that faith groups make to enrich their neighbourhoods and improve the lives of those around them. We would be poorer by far without their contribution, whether that’s running the local youth club; offering help to the homeless; or providing meals to the vulnerable.

Churches, temples, mosques and synagogues are keen to reach out beyond their own walls. Inter-faith activity is thriving and I’d encourage everyone to get involved in an event this year and remember to take a photo.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell will this evening join volunteers in delivering the donated gifts to a homeless shelter based in St Dionis’s Church, Parson’s Green, run by West London Churches Homeless Concern.

Our faith groups are a huge force for good in building strong communities with thousands of unsung individuals donating significant amounts of their free time to improve the lives of those around them. These people are instrumental in getting others involved in local social action.

Volunteering days like today is when A Year of Service will really come into its own, bringing people together and also helping to improve the neighbourhoods they live in.

The National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of the UK said:

A Year of Service is a wonderful initiative that promotes collaboration and a spirit of selfless service - two qualities greatly needed in today’s world. The National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of the UK is deeply honoured to host the initiative’s launch event during the festival of Ayyam-i-Ha - a time of joy, giving and hospitality - and to join hands with Secretary of State Eric Pickles, religious leaders and many distinguished guests to offer service in the community. We are confident that through unified action at the grassroots we can build a better society, and welcome A Year of Service as an excellent opportunity to advance this process.

Nick Hurd Minister for Civil Society said:

Faith groups are a powerful tool to catalyse social action, which is why the Cabinet Office has provided grant funding to support A Year of Service. We all want a bigger, stronger society where people get involved and do their bit. There is already a huge amount of good community work going on up and down the country and I would urge people to get involved in the very first A Year of Service - a great way for people of all faiths and of non-religious beliefs to come together to help improve their community.

The website for A Year of Service provides details of each volunteering day (or days), ideas for activities, background on why volunteering is important to each faith and suggestions as to where people can get involved and go for advice.

2. A ‘Year of Service’ consists of 12 special days throughout 2012 - coinciding with a religious festival of a different faith or an existing volunteering Day, plus a National Celebration in central London on 26 and 27 November during Inter Faith Week. Each special day will focussing on a particular theme and each faith in turn are holding volunteering activities involving everyone in their community. A ‘Year of Service’ project might be a church that not only encourages its own congregation to contribute food during Harvest Festival, but also invites the local mosque and a Sikh Gurdwara to join in. In a business, a staff Buddhist network could lead employees in projects to improve their local environment.

3. The project reflects and involves through a Reference Group the major faith communities: Baha’i, Buddhist, Christian, Jain, Jewish, Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and Zoroastrian faiths.

4. The Baha’i Faith is comparatively new: its Founder, Baha’u’llah, lived in Iran in the 19th century. It teaches the oneness of religion and promotes the unity of all people, and is prominent in social and economic development efforts worldwide, in such areas as health, literacy, and human rights education. The community in the UK numbers at least 6,000, and is actively involved in inter faith dialogue, social action, and educational processes that seek to raise the capacity of people from all backgrounds to contribute towards the betterment of society. Ayyam-i-Ha is a time of celebration, hospitality, charity, worship, gift-giving, and spiritual preparation for fasting in the Baha’i community. It lasts from 26 February to 1 March - four days, or five days in a leap year - and aligns the Baha’i calendar of 19 months, each of 19 days, with the solar calendar. More information on the Baha’i Faith in the UK can be found at:www.bahai.org.uk(external link).

5. The Faith through a Lens competition is open to people aged 16 or over, who are resident in the UK and are amateur photographers. Further details can be found at:www.faiththroughalens.co.uk(external link). Winners of the A Year of Service category will be announced at the National Celebration for A Year of Service in November 2012.

401,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-review-shows-coalfields-communities-need-local-approach,News story,New review shows coalfields communities need local approach,Local Councils should have a central role to play in the next phase of coalfields regeneration according to a new report welcomed by Housing…,"Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (2018 to 2021) and The Rt Hon Grant Shapps",30 September 2010,"Local Councils should have a central role to play in the next phase of coalfields regeneration according to a new report welcomed by Housing and Local Government Minister Grant Shapps today.

Mr Shapps said the review by Michael Clapham showed that while much had been achieved regenerating former coalfield areas there is still work to do. Improvement and economic recovery was still fragile and deeply embedded worklessness remained in some former mining areas.

The Report argues local authorities are best placed to understand their own areas and therefore have a central role to play with an increased emphasis on partnership working and flexibility at local level. But traditionally too much funding from central government had restrictive conditions and there was no flexibility to meet local specific needs. In the future, local and national partners need to come together to develop an integrated local programme approach.

Mr Shapps thanked Mr Clapham and said the Government would consider the recommendations carefully.

Grant Shapps said:

It’s crucial that former mining areas continue to get the support they need to move on from the devastation caused by the collapse of the coal industry. I’ve supported vital coalfields regeneration projects for many years and seen first-hand what they have achieved and their importance to these communities.

I am extremely grateful to Michael Clapham and his Board for offering their time and expertise to undertake this important Review. As they have highlighted, there is more to be done to help former mining communities where there are still ingrained social and economic problems.

We agree that it is often local authorities, working with local people, who know best what their particular needs are in each area and should have a central role to play in the next phase of coalfields regeneration. The Government will respond in detail to the recommendations in due course.

The coalfields programmes have been working for 13 years to regenerate former mining areas and have helped to create jobs and bring derelict land back into use. However, the recent PAC and NAO reports highlight the inefficiencies in the programme - including criticising the lack of clear goals and measures of success.

The Review of Coalfields Regeneration found the state of the coalfields today is a marked improvement on what they were a decade ago but there is still a long way to go. Pressing social challenges that still remain include:

1. Last year, the National Audit Office published a reportRegenerating the English Coalfields, focusing on CLG’s three coalfields regeneration initiatives - the National Coalfields Programme, the Coalfields Regeneration Trust and the Coalfields Enterprise Funds. In response to that report, and in the wake of a Public Accounts Committee hearing in January 2010, Ministers decided that it was timely to re-evaluate what has been done in the coalfields to date, to see where further improvements need to be made and to look where intervention is still needed. A Coalfields Regeneration Review was announced by the previous Government in March this year.

2.The Review was undertaken by a Board, chaired by Michael Clapham (former MP for Barnsley and former Chair of the All-Party Backbench Group of Coalfield MPs), comprising senior representatives from: the Industrial Communities Alliance (the all-party association of local authorities in traditional industrial areas), the HCA, Enterprise Ventures Ltd, and the Coalfields Regeneration Trust, as well as officials from CLG. The Review’s purpose was to help inform the direction of future government intervention in former mining communities, both for the remainder of the current Comprehensive Spending Review Period, and also into the next Spending Review period.

3.The Review looked at lessons learnt from the programme’s achievements so far. The Review aimed to ensure that the impact of all regeneration expenditure in the coalfields is maximised so that ongoing problems, such as worklessness and health inequalities, are tackled effectively, and that the optimum value for money is achieved for the investments made.

4. Michael Clapham submitted a report to Ministers on 17 September 2010, which is available on the Departmental website (www.communities.gov.uk).

The final decisions will be made at the end of the Spending Review in the autumn.

Reducing bureaucracy and rolling back regional government is central to the Government’s wider aims of transferring power from central government to councils and communities.

The Government has already announced the abolition of the Government Office for London, the Regional Spatial Strategies, the Regional Assemblies/Regional Leaders’ Boards and the Regional Development Agencies.

The Coalition Agreement committed Government to a review of the remaining eight Government Offices as part of its wider localism and decentralisation agenda, and Ministers have decided in principle to close the Government Offices for the Regions.

Over the coming weeks the Department for Communities and Local Government will continue to work with other Government Departments, trade unions and others to lead a process to agree arrangements for the transfer of a small number of on-going functions and redeployment of staff.

Eric Pickles, the Secretary of State, said:

I do not believe the arbitrary government regions to be a tier of administration that is efficient, effective or popular. Citizens across England identify with their county, their city, their town, their borough and their neighbourhood. The case for elected regional government was overwhelmingly rejected by the people in the 2004 North East Referendum. Unelected regional government equally lacks democratic legitimacy, and its continuing existence has created a democratic deficit.

Let me be clear: The Government Offices are not voices of the region in Whitehall. They have become agents of Whitehall to intervene and interfere in localities, and are a fundamental part of the ‘command and control’ apparatus of England’s over-centralised state.

During the Spending Review the 13 sponsor Departments of the Government Offices will work on the details of the closure and transition arrangements and consider how the civil resilience responsibilities will be reallocated. The detailed outcome will be reflected in the final decisions which will be announced in the autumn.

There are nine offices based in the Government regions: North East, South West, South East, West Midland, Yorkshire and the Humber, London, East Midlands, North West, East of England.  The Department for Communities and Local Government oversees the Government Office Network, on behalf of all sponsor Departments.

Official statistics published today reveal that the average Band D council tax set by local authorities in England for 2012-13 will be £1444 - a 0.3 per cent change on last year.

Council tax bills more than doubled between 1997 and 2011. The majority of councils (358) have accepted the Government’s grant offer by freezing or reducing their council tax levels in 2012-13.

This is the second year the Government has made funding available for a council tax freeze for local residents, families and pensioners. Last year’s freeze saved households up to an estimated £72 on a Band D bill, and this year’s freeze is potentially worth the same saving to residents.

Every household in London will benefit from an actual cash-terms cut in council tax. Ministers also praised over twenty authorities for cutting their council tax in cash-terms. They include Hammersmith and Fulham, the Greater London Authority South Oxfordshire, Stratford-on-Avon, Windsor and Maidenhead, Chorley and Brentwood.

The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles said:

After years of hurt when council tax bills doubled - to around £120 a month - our action is putting residents first for a second consecutive year. The overwhelming majority of councils, 358, have taken up our funding deal to freeze council tax.

The average Band D change across England is a mere 0.3 per cent. This is a real terms cut in council tax and real help to hard-working families and pensioners with their cost of living expenses.

The definitive National Statistics published today revealed that the average Band D council tax set by local authorities in England for 2012-13 will be £1,444. In London it will be £1,304; in metropolitan areas £1,401; and in shire areas £1,492. Council tax bills hit £1,439 on Band D in England in 2010-11 and remained at that level in 2011-12. The statistical release can be found here:www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/counciltax201213.

The 85 per cent of authorities that chose not to put up their council tax will now receive a grant worth between a 2.5 and 3 per cent increase on their 2011-12 Band D council tax. The final list of councils that have agreed to take part in the Government’s 2012-13 council tax freeze initiative can be found here:www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/2110558.xls(Excel, 73kb).

Without the freeze grant offer local taxpayers living in an average Band D home in England could have faced increases of up to £72 in each of the two years of the council tax freeze schemes. The value of these saving for taxpayers by area compared to a five per cent rise can be found here:www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028892.xls(Excel, 63kb).

More details on how the council tax freeze scheme for 2012-13 works can be found here:www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/2000149.pdf(PDF, 32kb).

Local authorities who do not put up their council tax will receive a grant worth between a 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent increase on their Band D council tax. The amount of grant authorities will receive for freezing or reducing their council tax in 2012-13 can be found here:www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/2111493.xls(Excel, 81.5kb)

The authorities cutting their council tax in cash-terms by more than 0.1 per cent for 2012-13 are:

The Localism Act abolished Whitehall capping in England and instead gives the public the right to approve or veto excessive council tax rises in a binding referendum. This new ‘local tax lock’ gave people a vote to stop council tax going up if their local authority sought to hike the tax above a ceiling approved by the House of Commons each year will automatically trigger a referendum of all registered local electors in their area. On 8 February 2012, the House endorsed a 3.5 per cent referendums threshold for most authorities. No local authorities have reported a triggered referendum this year, though a small number opted to set a level just below the threshold.

The Government’s provisional funding settlement for English local authorities next financial year will mean councils have an average spending power of £2,186 per dwelling at their disposal. £27.8 billion will be distributed in 2012-13 in a fair and sustainable way across all parts of the country - rural and urban, metropolitan and shire. It will give more weight to areas with the highest levels of assessed need. For example, the average spending power per household in Hackney will be £3,050 compared with £1,537 in Windsor and Maidenhead reflecting the fairness of the settlement. Overall the average spending power reduction for councils in 2012-13 is expected to be limited to just 3.3 per cent or £75 per household, less than last year’s comparable figure of 4.5 per cent.

Council tax was £688 in 1997-98. This means council tax has risen over one hundred per cent - or an extra £751 a year on a Band D home in the years up to 2010-11 before the freeze grant was offered. Since all other Bands are set as a percentage of Band D, homes in every band have seen their bills double. Average Band D council tax and percentage change between 1993-94 and 2012-13 are shown below:

The consultation paperTechnical reforms of council taxfollows the Local Government Resource Review’s commitment to consider what flexibilities local authorities should have to help keep overall council tax levels down. The consultation sets out a series of practical proposals which will help hard-working families and pensioners with their council tax bills.

The proposals include new scope for councils to:

These reforms could allow councils to make up to a £20 reduction in the bill for a typical Band D property in England. Getting empty homes back into use will increase housing supply and tackle properties that can attract squatters and vandalism and blight communities.

The paper also consults on the empty homes premium for long-term properties announced by ministers in September. There are no plans to change the rules on council tax relief currently available for homes left empty because a person has moved into a hospital or care home, or has died, or has moved to provide care to another. These are special circumstances where there is a justification for a home temporarily lying empty. Moreover, councils will be encouraged to use their existing powers to apply discretionary discounts in cases where homes are empty due to other justifiable circumstances - for example, hardship, fire or flooding.

The consultation also proposes changes to modernise the council tax system and address potentially unfair future charges. These include:

These practical improvements complement other reforms to council tax: confirming there will be no council tax revaluation which would have forced up bills for millions of homes; working with local councils to deliver a two-year council tax freeze; and giving local residents a new right to veto excessive council tax increases.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

Council tax bills have more than doubled since 1997. This Government is taking action to keep council tax down, confirmed there will be no council tax revaluation and helped freeze council tax for two years. I want to do more to help everyday families with their cost of living. By treating everyone equally and fairly and removing the special tax breaks for empty homes and second homes, councils have the potential to cut £20 a year off families’ council tax bills. Councils should make it easier to pay bills, and offer the same discounts for electronic billing that other companies offer as standard - this will cut paperwork and reduce tax bills.

The consultationTechnical reforms of council taxcan be found here:www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/technicalreformcounciltax

The proposed changes include:

(a) Giving billing authorities power to levy up to full council tax on second homes, currently councils can levy a 10 to 50 per cent discount. Councils can already reduce the second homes discount to just 10 per cent - we propose giving councils the local discretion to charge the normal rate of council tax. The job-related second homes discount (where someone has to live in a dwelling because of their job) would be unaffected. The Government has increased the help the Armed Forces scheme gives for service personnel towards council tax.

(b) Replacing empty home council tax exemptions Classes A and C with discounts, the amount of which would be for councils to determine - allowing them to reduce the discount from 100 per cent to 0.

(c) Abolishing empty home council tax Class L exemption (repossessed home), and making mortgagees in possession of empty dwellings (i.e. the banks) liable to council tax in respect of them.

(d) Seeking views on whether billing authorities should be given the option to levy an “empty homes premium” on the council tax payable in respect of properties that have been left empty (for two years or more, for example).

(e) Setting a default assumption that payment of council tax by instalments will be over 12 months rather than (as is currently the case) 10.

(f) Allowing councils to publish online the “Information to be supplied with demand notices”, but with a duty to supply it in hardcopy to any council tax payer requesting it - as an efficiency measure, and to encourage the take-up of electronic billing.

(g) Eliminating potential tax complications from arrangements involving third party suppliers where solar panels are placed on the roofs of dwellings without coming into the paramount control of the resident.

The trip forms part of a broader effort to meet UK Trade and Investment’s (UKTI) target of doubling trade with Central and Eastern Europe by £30 billion by 2020. The delegation of businesses includes companies from the energy, rail, healthcare, life sciences, retail and security sectors, reflecting some of the highest value opportunities for British businesses in this region.

During the visit Lord Livingston will launch 2 new British Business Centres in Slovakia and Hungary, transforming the quantity and quality of support available to small and mid-sized UK firms exporting to those countries. Each business centre will be staffed with trade teams.

A British Business Centre for Poland opened last year (2013) and business centres in the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovenia are due to open shortly.

Trade Minister Lord Livingston said:

This is a dynamic and exciting growth market. British firms have doubled trade exports to Eastern and Central European countries in the last 10 years but we still lag behind our rivals.

By 2020, I want to double exports to this region, so we are ramping up our support for British firms on the ground by opening a network of business centres across the region and increasing the number of trade missions to introduce more British businesses to potential buyers.

The 4 countries of Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, along with 5 others in the Central Europe Network (Austria, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovenia and Croatia), have a combined population of over 100 million people, a combinedGDPin excess of £1 trillion and annual average growth rates that in recent years have far exceeded most other European countries.

These countries also have low levels of public debt compared with the Eurozone average and the region is about to benefit from £124 billion of EU funding between 2014 and 2020, enhancing investment prospects in infrastructure, energy and innovation.

In Poland Lord Livingston will visit Rolls-Royce which has a service centre in the Port of Gdynia and an Engineering Services Centre in Krakow employing over 70 specialists in engineering design and supply chain management.

Other British business success stories in the region include Tesco, which now has almost 1,200 stores, AstraZeneca, HSBC, Bupa and engineering company Atkins. The 60 British companies taking part in the trade delegation will spend time with these companies to learn from their experiences in the region and the value of exporting.

West Midlands based automotive manufacturer Westfield Sportscars will be 1 of the companies on the trip.

Julian Turner, Westfield Sportscars Managing Director said:

We are looking to expand further afield both in Europe and elsewhere across the globe. We’ve had huge success in Japan following assistance fromUKTI, including an Overseas Market Introduction Service into the Japanese and Asia Pacific markets, and we’re hoping to replicate this in Central and Eastern Europe.

Our aim is to set up new European dealers to sell our European Small Series compliant road vehicle, Sport Turbo, and our well-established Westfield Race Car, AeroRace.

“It is a huge pleasure to be in Poland again. The United Kingdom and Poland share an important relationship. We are close allies within the EU and NATO and share a similar outlook on many international issues. Today we had a valuable discussion on issues which matter to both our countries. Of course the situation in Syria was foremost in our minds. Britain and Poland stand together with the Syrian people as they face a shocking humanitarian situation brought about by the violence of the Assad regime. We also discussed a wide range of other topics including NATO, European defence and bilateral defence cooperation.

“This morning we also discussed Europe’s Eastern Neighbourhood. The United Kingdom will continue to support the Eastern Partnership and I would like to pay tribute to Minister Radek Sikorski for his efforts in encouraging the EU to reach out to our Eastern neighbours.

“The Eastern Partnership has the potential to transform the EU’s relationship with our eastern partners and with it the prospect of meaningful integration. Any such integration relies on a genuine commitment by all parties to a set of common values. These common values must be the foundation stone of the Eastern Partnership, just as they are for the EU.

“We want to offer strong support to our partners to carry out reforms and will help them to succeed; but there can be no backsliding on democracy. In this respect, the Ukrainian and Georgian Parliamentary elections in October will be of paramount importance.

“On Belarus, we call - once more - for the release and rehabilitation of all political detainees as a first step towards the normalisation of relations. We hope that this weekend’s parliamentary elections will be conducted to international standards, and that there will no repeat of the violence against peaceful protesters that marred the 2012 Presidential elections.

“We also discussed many other issues including economic growth, the single market and increasing trade.”

Foreign & Defence Secretaries visit Warsaw



The Foreign Secretary attended a commercial diplomacy event in the British Embassy. The event was planned as an exhibition of UK strategic competency and live exhibits which are available in Poland and the broader region, showcasing the UK experience in energy sector power generation and engineering, and the potential of Poland as the leading market in Emerging Europe.

Quadrilateral meeting: statements



Top British automotive and construction engineering brands, including Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lotus and JCB, were on display in the Embassy garden. The visit of the Foreign and Defence Secretaries concluded with a meeting with Poland’s President Bronis?aw Komorowski. It was an excellent opportunity to build on the ministerial discussions held earlier in the day.

This was the second quadrilateral meeting between the UK and Poland on diplomacy and defence issues. The first one had been held in London in October 2010.",Continued support to our partners to carry out reforms,Welfare,,id25_408

“It is a tragedy, that is the first thing to say. This was a highly respected ambassador who worked very closely with many of our staff at the British Embassy in Tripoli and was working hard in the interests not just of the United States but in the interests of the people of Libya, and I called Secretary Clinton at the weekend to express our condolences and also to discuss the various security measures that each of our countries has taken. I also met the US Assistant Secretary of State Bill Burns in Baghdad the day after it happened last week and discussed the situation with him.

“I think the first thing to say about this is that the film was designed to provoke outrage and disorder, and, although I have not seen it, it is clearly a contemptible piece of work and we should be clear in our opinion about it. At the same time, there is no excuse for violence, and it must be understood across the region that diplomats working in Benghazi and other places are doing so to try to help the people of Libya. And I therefore welcome the clear condemnation of what has happened by leaders - including what are generally termed Islamist leaders - across the region, including by the President of Egypt, who I visited earlier the same day, and by the leaders of Tunisia and, of course, very emphatically by Libyan leaders.

“And I think it’s also important to point out, so that people can see what the true balance of opinion probably is in Libya, the outpouring of support, and the very strong reaction against the violence in Benghazi which our embassy has reported from Libya, where people have taken to the streets saying: not in our name. Our embassy have been inundated with messages condemning the attacks. The Libyan political leaders and leaders of the Government have repeatedly condemned what they’ve called a cowardly and criminal act. And in my own experience, and I’ve visited Benghazi twice in the last year, there are vast numbers of people there who want good relations with Western nations and, indeed, all nations and are grateful for all the assistance that we have given them.

“And so I believe we must continue our support for people in the so called Arab Spring, trying to bring freedom and democracy to their countries. This is a tragic event, but we must not be disheartened by it.  We must continue that support and maintain our faith in their ability to succeed.”

A full transcript of the Foreign Secretary’s session with the Foreign Affairs committee will be available on the Parliament website shortly.

410,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-statement-to-the-house-of-commons-on-british-embassy-tehran,News story,Foreign Secretary statement to the House of Commons on British Embassy Tehran,Foreign Secretary William Hague has made a statement following an attack on the British Embassy compound on 29 November.,Foreign & Commonwealth Office and The Rt Hon William Hague,30 November 2011,"“Shortly after three o’clock Tehran time yesterday approximately two hundred demonstrators overran the city-centre compound of our Embassy in Tehran. The majority of demonstrators were from a student Basij militia organisation. We should be clear from the outset that this is an organisation controlled by elements of the Iranian regime.

The demonstrators proceeded systematically to vandalise and loot the homes of staff located on the site and the Ambassador’s residence. They destroyed furniture, stole property including the personal possessions of our staff and set fire to the main Embassy office building.

Simultaneously, our second Embassy compound at Gulhaq in North Tehran also came under attack. Staff homes there were also attacked and looted. Our staff immediately evacuated the buildings affected and took refuge in safe areas of the compound.

It was not until yesterday evening later that we received confirmation that the Iranian diplomatic police had belatedly assisted at both compounds and that all our staff were accounted for.

I wish to pay a fulsome tribute to our Ambassador and his staff who throughout these hours of danger behaved with the utmost calm and professionalism and followed well-developed contingency plans. The Prime Minister and I have spoken to him several times in the last 24 hours and passed on our thanks to the UK-based and locally-engaged members of his team.

It will be obvious to the whole House and the whole world that these events are a grave violation of the Vienna Convention which states that a host state is required to protect the premises of a diplomatic mission against any intrusion, damage or disturbance. This is a breach of international responsibilities of which any nation should be ashamed.

It is true that relations between Britain and Iran are difficult, as they are to varying degrees between Iran and many other nations. We publicly differ with Iran over its nuclear programme, and on human rights, and we make no secret of our views. We have been foremost among those nations arguing for peaceful legitimate pressure to be intensified on Iran in the light of the IAEA’s “deep and increasing concern” about the Iranian nuclear program, including its “possible military dimensions.”

But we should be absolutely clear that no difficulty in relations can ever excuse in any way or under any circumstances the failure to protect diplomatic staff and diplomatic premises. Iran is a country where Opposition leaders are under house arrest, more than 500 people have been executed so far this year and where genuine protest is ruthlessly stamped on. The idea that the Iranian authorities could not have protected our Embassy or that this assault could have taken place without some degree of regime consent is fanciful.

Yesterday I called the Iranian Foreign Minister to protest in the strongest terms about these events and to demand immediate steps to ensure the safety of our staff and of both Embassy compounds. He said that he was sorry for what had happened and that action would be taken in response. The Iranian Charge d’Affaires in London was summoned to the Foreign Office to reinforce these messages.

COBR met yesterday afternoon and again this morning with the Prime Minister in the Chair.

The UN Security Council issued a Statement condemning the attack on our Embassy in the strongest terms and calling on the Iranian authorities to “protect diplomatic and consular property and personnel”.

I am grateful for the strong statements of concern and support from the United States, the European Union, Germany, Poland, Russia, China and many other nations.

I particularly wish to thank France for the robust support they have given us in every way, and for the practical assistance and accommodation that they have provided to our staff in Tehran.

Across Europe Iranian Ambassadors have been summoned to receive strong protests. In the words of the Foreign Minister of Austria: “with the attack on the British Embassy, Iran is now on the verge of placing itself completely outside of the framework of international law. If Iran thinks it can undermine European solidarity through such actions, it is wrong. Officials in Tehran are called upon to implement their legal commitments and protect diplomatic facilities, with no ifs or buts”.

I am grateful to our other friends in the region itself, particularly the United Arab Emirates for their practical help. I am also grateful to the Foreign Minister of Turkey for his prompt and helpful intervention in these matters last night.

The safety of our staff and of other British nationals in Iran is our highest priority.

We have now closed the British Embassy in Tehran. We have decided to evacuate all our staff and as of the last few minutes all our UK-based staff have now left Iran.

We will work with friendly countries to ensure that residual British interests are protected and that urgent consular assistance is available to British nationals. We advise against all but essential travel to Iran. At present there are no indications that British nationals outside the Embassy are being targeted in any way. British nationals requiring urgent consular assistance will receive help from other EU missions in Tehran.

But clearly that cannot be the end of the matter.

The Iranian Charge in London is being informed now that we require the immediate closure of the Iranian Embassy in London and that all Iranian diplomatic staff must leave the United Kingdom within the next 48 hours.

If any country makes it impossible for us to operate on their soil they cannot expect to have a functioning Embassy here.

This does not amount to the severing of diplomatic relations in their entirety. It is action that reduces our relations with Iran to the lowest level consistent with the maintenance of diplomatic relations.

The House will understand that it remains desirable for British representatives to be in contact with Iranian representatives, for instance as part of any negotiations about their nuclear programme or to discuss human rights. But it does mean that both Embassies will be closed.

We wish to make absolutely clear to Iran and to any other nation that such action against our Embassies and such a flagrant breach of international responsibilities is totally unacceptable to the United Kingdom.

Later today and tomorrow I will attend the meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels when we will discuss these events and further action which needs to be taken in the light of Iran’s continued pursuit of a nuclear weapons programme.

As a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a leading member of the EU we are proud of the role our country plays in maintaining international peace and security and standing up for human rights all over the world. If the Iranian Government thinks we will be diverted from these responsibilities by the intimidation of our Embassy staff they will be making a serious mistake.”",Closure of the British Embassy in Tehran and demand for closure of the Iranian Embassy in London,Institutional,,id25_410

“It was a pleasure to welcome Foreign Ministers from across the Gulf to the second meeting of the UK-GCC strategic dialogue. The Gulf is a strategically important region, with increasing political, cultural and economic influence. Since the launch of the Gulf Initiative in 2010, we have worked hard to renew our historical ties and build closer relationships with our Gulf partners. The UK-GCC strategic dialogue is an excellent way of making sure we keep in close contact on key bilateral and regional issues.

“Today we discussed ways to broaden UK-GCC cooperation in a wide range of fields. We agreed that a Joint Action Plan should be developed on issues that concern us all, including the maintenance of peace and security in the region, economic prosperity, and strengthening cooperation in trade, investment and consular activities. We also discussed wider issues of concern which threaten the stability of the region, specifically Syria, and how we can work together to increase the pressure on the Assad Government to end the violence and allow a political transition. I also updated the group on progress in talks between Iran and the E3+3 in Moscow. I made clear that we remain committed to finding a peaceful, diplomatic solution to the nuclear issue, but that the pressure will only increase on Iran until it shows it is willing to take urgent, concrete steps to build confidence that its nuclear programme is purely peaceful.”",Joint Action Plan,Legislative,,id25_411

“In a world that is dominated by networks and not by the power blocs of old, the Commonwealth is the ultimate network. It has extraordinary reach - across 54 countries, six continents and oceans and two billion citizens.”

“The Commonwealth is a powerful global brand that many millions of people around the world are proud to be associated with, as our Government and our Parliament certainly are.”

“In our first year in office my ministerial team and I have already visited more than 20 Commonwealth countries, including Australia and New Zealand, both of which had not been visited by a British Foreign Secretary for nearly twenty years.”

“We have increased resources devoted by the FCO to Commonwealth issues, we have re-focussed where Britain gives its international development assistance with the result that more than half of the 27 countries that receive our aid are now from the Commonwealth, and we are dedicating more of our Chevening Scholarship programme to Commonwealth students.”

The Foreign Secretary looked forward to the presentation of the recommendations of the Eminent Persons’ Group at the Heads of Government meeting in Perth in October (CHOGM) and called on the Commonwealth to embrace this opportunity to redefine itself and lay new plans for the future.

“We also need to change if we are to ensure that the Commonwealth is as effective and inspiring a standard-bearer of democratic principles as it can and should be.

“We should be inspired and given new confidence by the demand for freedom that is sweeping parts of the Middle East and North Africa, which confirm what our countries have long known, that the desire for political and economic freedom is universal, and which make it more important than ever that we, as individual countries and as an organisation, are seen to stand on the side of freedom, not just in our words but in our actions.”

The Foreign Secretary emphasised the role that the Commonwealth can play as a leading voice in the global economy, working to liberalise trade and break down barriers for international business. The Commonwealth contains some of the fastest growing new economies in the world, with a combined GDP that has more than doubled in the last twenty years. Over the last two decades the importance of Commonwealth members to each other as sources of imports has grown by a quarter, and by a third as destinations for exports. More than half of Commonwealth countries now export over a quarter of their total exports to other Commonwealth members.

57th Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference



Lord Howell: “This is a reminder that the Commonwealth is a gathering of peoples as well as of governments and a thousand other organisations, particularly of parliamentarians. So I welcome this gathering greatly, and I wish all who come to Westminster well.”

Lord Howell, Minister for the Commonwealth welcomed the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) to Westminster. Speaking on 26 July, Lord Howell describedthe Commonwealth as the soft power network of the future:

“The sheer breadth and diversity that the Commonwealth typifies is extraordinary and is something to be celebrated.

“We want it to play a key role in the unfolding opportunities and challenges that our increasingly networked world brings.

“We want the Commonwealth to lift the prosperity of all its members through increased free and fair trade. We want the Commonwealth to become a leading voice in the global economy, working to liberalise trade, break down barriers for international business, resist protectionism and contribute to the Doha Development Agenda.

“The next Heads of Government meeting in Perth in October, in now what is less than 100 days, has the potential to be a transformational one for the Commonwealth. We have a real opportunity to shape the Commonwealth network to react, engage and lead on the world stage, a stage on which the Indian Ocean, and all the states surrounding it are increasingly taking a central place.”

414,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-office-review-of-export-policy,News story,Foreign Office review of export policy,Foreign Secretary William Hague announced the outcome of a review of UK defence and security export policy in light of events in the Middle East and North Africa.,Foreign & Commonwealth Office and The Rt Hon William Hague,13 October 2011,"In a written statement to Parliament the Foreign Secretary said:

“On 16 March 2011, I told the Foreign Affairs Committee that the Government would review policy and practice with regard to the export of equipment that might be used for internal repression, in particular crowd control goods, in the light of events in the Middle East and North Africa.  Government colleagues with responsibilities in this area, in particular the Secretary of State for Business, Innovations and Skills who has responsibility for our export licensing systems and operations, have been consulted in the course of this review.

The review concluded that there are no fundamental flaws with the UK export licensing system. But the review identified areas where our system could be further strengthened to enable Ministers to respond rapidly and decisively to the outbreak of conflict, instability or unpredictable events in other countries. Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms is already a mandatory criterion for all export licence decisions. The changes announced today will increase our confidence that UK origin goods will not be misused for internal repression, and that our controls are being applied in an orderly and systematic way, informed and influenced by our values and interests. This will complement the Government’s efforts to build Britain’s prosperity by increasing exports and helping UK companies succeed in international markets.

The Government proposes to introduce a mechanism to allow immediate licensing suspension to countries experiencing a sharp deterioration in security or stability. Applications in the pipeline would be stopped and no further licences issued, pending Ministerial or departmental review.We also propose the introduction of a revised risk categorisation, based on objective indicators and reviewed regularly, that keeps pace with changing circumstances; enhances our assessment against all export control Criteria, including human rights violations; and allows specifically for Ministerial scrutiny of open licences to ensure that the benefits of open licensing can be maintained while keeping the associated risks to acceptable levels. This will increase oversight by Ministers, including of individual licence applications.

As a result of these changes the Foreign and Commonwealth Office will ensure that export licensing policy is more responsive to rapidly changing circumstances, particularly political instability; bring more structure and consistency to the gathering of export related information, provide more information on the human rights situation in country, including through following new security and justice assistance guidance and undertake end-use monitoring of controlled military goods, bearing in mind both the practical and resource limitations.

The Government will continue to work to improve public information on defence & security exports, including enhanced transparency of routine export licensing decisions and how we respond during a crisis. We welcome the scrutiny of the Committees on Arms Export Controls and will continue to assist in their important work.

The Government has also considered how we can strengthen our decision making when we provide security and justice assistance overseas.  We must provide assistance to international partners to tackle threats such as terrorism, serious organised crime and conflict prevention. In doing so, we will ensure that this assistance supports our values, is consistent with our domestic and international human rights obligations, and seeks to promote human rights and democracy. To this end, guidance will be issued for all HMG officials on assessing the human rights implications of our overseas security and justice assistance.  We will make this guidance public later this year.

We are committed to robust and effective national and global controls to help prevent exports that could undermine our own security or core values of human rights and democracy; to protect our security through strategic defence relationships; and to promote our prosperity by allowing British defence and security industries to operate effectively in the global defence market.

The Government is determined to learn the wider lessons of events in the Middle East and North Africa. I believe that this package of improvements is the proper response to the lessons of this year. This does not preclude additional measures or further strengthening of the system.”","Introduction of a mechanism to allow immediate licensing suspension to countries experiencing a sharp deterioration in security or stability, and the introduction of a revised risk categorisation.",Administrative,Legislative,id25_414

The Libyan Ambassador was expelled in May.,Foreign & Commonwealth Office and The Rt Hon William Hague,27 July 2011,"The Foreign Office confirmed that the Libyan Charge d’Affaires has been called to the FCO and is being informed that he and the remaining Libyan diplomats in the UK are being expelled.

Foreign Secretary William Hague said:

“What we are doing in Libya is necessary, legal and right. We could not and did not turn a blind eye when Qadhafi turned his forces against innocent civilians, shelled peaceful protestors and targeted victims crammed in hospitals. The international community’s actions have saved thousands of lives. We have averted massive slaughter in Benghazi. And we have protected innocent Libyans across the country.

When I visited Benghazi I saw for myself how close Qadhafi’s forces came and what was possible after they had been stopped. My visit allowed a window into a Libya free from Qadhafi - where the legitimate aspirations of the people are welcomed not repressed, and where debate, a free media and civil society are encouraged not crushed.

The UK is committed to supporting the Libyan people. We are a strong and true friend. Britain has lead implementation of UNSCR 1973 from the front - providing key aircraft including Typhoons, Tornados and Apaches. We have led political support to the NTC - bringing together an unprecedented international coalition at the London Conference and providing practical assistance since. Our office in Benghazi is now our largest in North Africa after Cairo, and led by one of the Foreign Office’s most senior diplomats.  UK teams have helped build command and control capacity as well as assist the NTC in their post-Qadhafi planning. And we have provided communications equipment, support for the emerging free media and widespread support for the police. We have provided substantial humanitarian assistance and support to clear mines. We are already helping communities return to normal life and we are continuing to advise the NTC as they look beyond Qadhafi. The Libyan people can be assured that we will remain on their side for as long as it takes.

At the latest Libya Contact Group in Istanbul the international community sent an unequivocal message to Qadhafi: that he had no legitimacy and there was no future for Libya with him in power. As part of this it decided “to deal with the National Transitional Council (NTC) as the legitimate governing authority in Libya”. This was a significant development, and today I will outline the action that the UK will now take in response.

The Prime Minister and I have decided that the United Kingdom recognises and will deal with the National Transitional Council as the sole governmental authority in Libya. This decision reflects the NTC’s increasing legitimacy, competence and success in reaching out to Libyans across the country. Through its actions the NTC has shown its commitment to a more open and democratic Libya - something that it is working to achieve through an inclusive political process. This is in stark contrast to Qadhafi, whose brutality against the Libyan people has stripped him of all legitimacy.

The NTC is a focal point for people throughout Libya who want a better future for their country.  Our decision also reflects the responsibilities that the NTC has taken on in the areas under its control. It means we will deal with the NTC on the same basis as other governments around the world..

In line with this decision we therefore summoned the Libyan Charge d’Affaires here to the FCO this morning and informed him that he and other regime diplomats from the Qadhafi regime must leave the UK. We no longer recognise them as the representatives of the Libyan Government, and are inviting the NTC to appoint a new Libyan diplomatic envoy to take over the Libyan Embassy in London.

In line with UNSCRs 1970 & 1973, the UK continues to explore how to unfreeze assets to support the NTC. At the request of the Arabian Gulf Oil Company, a Libyan oil company, the UK is ready to make available £91 million of the Company’s assets in the UK.

AGOCO is operating under the control of the NTC and we are assured that its activities will not benefit any listed entity under the sanctions.  We will issue licences for the use of its frozen funds to meet its basic needs. This will help to ensure that the crucial provision of fuel is maintained. We will work hard with our international partners in the coming weeks to unfreeze further Libyan assets frozen in the UK for the benefit of the Libyan people, including stocks of Libyan currency and other assets of the Libyan Central Bank, in line with UNSCRs 1970 and 1973. We are also discussing with partners what funds we can make available for the benefit of the Libyan people to alleviate the hardships they face.

I am conscious that the Libyan students in the UK whose expenses have been paid by the Libyan People’s Bureau will be concerned about what this decision means for them.  I want to reassure them that we are working closely with the NTC and the relevant banks and will do all we can to make sure that they and their families will continue to receive the funds to which they are entitled.

This decision marks another step towards a better, democratic future for Libya - a future that does not include Qadhafi. The momentum has shifted against him and those around him. There is steady progress across the board, in particular around Misrata, Brega and Jebel Nafusa where the opposition is driving Qadhafi’s forces back. Reports suggest that morale amongst the regime’s forces is low. Economic sanctions are restricting his ability to wage war on Qadhafi’s own people.

I am making this announcement today to reflect the facts on the ground and increase our support for those fighting and working for a better future in Libya. We will sustain our actions for as long as is necessary. Our recent decision to deploy an additional four Tornados to Libya is a concrete illustration of this. This was the united international message from the Contact Group in Istanbul.

What I have announced today will allow us to give further assistance to the people of Libya and underline the message to the Qadhafi regime that their legitimacy has come to an end.”",Recognition and dealing with the National Transitional Council (NTC) as the sole governmental authority in Libya.,Institutional,,id25_415

Even today, the remains of many of the victims are undiscovered and unidentified, their families still searching for closure.

To all those who lost loved ones, I offer my deepest sympathy on this anniversary.

We must never forget the act of genocide that happened at Srebrenica. It was a crime that shamed Europe.

We owe it to the victims to learn the lesson of Srebrenica: that evil must be confronted if humanity is to be protected. We owe it to the victims to ensure that those indicted for this appalling crime are pursued relentlessly until they are brought to justice.

The British Government I lead will not rest in its efforts to make sure that Ratko Mladic is brought to the International Criminal Tribunal at the Hague, alongside other fugitives like Goran Hadzic.

At the same time, we must continue to build a brighter future for Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region. We welcome recent steps towards reconciliation, such as the motion by the Serbian Parliament condemning the crimes committed at Srebrenica and apologising to the victims.

Britain’s new Government will take a close interest in the region. We will work hard to enable Bosnia and Herzegovina and the whole Balkan region to move forward, and in due course to join the European Union and NATO.

But as we look to the future, we pledge never to forget the past, and to do all in our power to ensure that such an atrocity can never be repeated.”

New research published today by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office shows that:



Minister for Consular Affairs Jeremy Browne said:

“With over 5 million Britons living abroad, people are increasingly making the most of opportunities to visit their loved ones across the world. However, it’s important to understand that staying in someone’s home does not make you exempt from encountering serious problems. Take the same steps before you go as you would for any other holiday, such as taking out travel insurance and doing some pre-trip research, to ensure you are prepared if something does go wrong.”

Despite the belief that they don’t have to prepare for a holiday when visiting friends and family, 39% of British nationals have ended up relying on their host when things have gone wrong during their trip. British expats hosting visitors have to deal with a range of problems from taking their guests to hospital when they fall ill to providing financial help.

Dean Churm, British Consul for Florida, said:

“What would your host appreciate more? A box of teabags or dealing with a hefty medical bill because you had an accident and were not insured? Getting comprehensive travel insurance means that whilst an accident may disrupt your holiday, it won’t bankrupt you in extortionate medical or repatriation bills”

Keeping the costs of a trip as low as possible is often a top priority when planning to visit friends and family who live abroad.  However, attempting to save money by not taking out travel insurance can be a false economy when faced with the high costs of medical treatment or the loss of valuable possessions.

The FCO is urging people to prepare for a trip to visit loved ones in the same way as they would for any other holiday to limit serious problems occurring when overseas.

It’s risky to travel without insurance - even losing your baggage could leave you out of pocket unless you are covered.

And it’s not just insurance that people are forgetting about, what about the health precautions? Phil Lord, from the FCO’s Know Before You Go campaign, said:

“It’s easy to think that travel preparation advice does not apply to you if you’re visiting a familiar destination but knowing a country well does not make you exempt from encountering problems. If you’re visiting a malaria hotspot make sure you have taken preventative measures and don’t assume you’re immune. Far better to be prepared so you can avoid any nasty surprises and focus on enjoying your time with loved ones.”",FCO urging people to prepare for a trip to visit loved ones in the same way as they would for any other holiday,Informational,Public Campaigns,id25_420

This would lead to the creation of Israel’s first university beyond the Green Line, in a settlement illegal under international law. It would further entrench the presence of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories and create an additional barrier to peace with the Palestinians.

“This move is particularly regrettable because it comes at a time of rapidly expanding co-operation between UK and Israeli universities, and when the British Government has taken a firm stand against those who seek to undermine Israel’s legitimacy by boycotting educational and cultural institutions.

Speaking after the visit, the Foreign Office Minister said:

“It was a pleasure to visit the UAE to renew our close ties with the Emiratis. Through the UK-UAE Taskforce our investment is growing in each other’s economies and our cultural and educational links are prospering. British nationals are helping to drive UAE prosperity and have been involved in iconic projects like the Burj Khalifa and Abu Dhabi Formula One. Emirati investment in the UK is also thriving, through innovative projects like the London Array, the world’s largest offshore wind farm, and the fantastic Emirates Skyline - a new cable car across the River Thames in London.

“This week we explored how to strengthen our trade and investment links, how we can work more closely on legal and consular issues and our cooperation on shared foreign policy priorities in Syria, Iran and Somalia. We also discussed what more the UK and UAE can do together on renewable energy, as we approach the UN Climate Change negotiations in November. As we look ahead to the next Taskforce meeting in London, I’m sure our relationship will continue to go from strength to strength.”

The UK-UAE Taskforce was part of a two-day visit by Mr Burt to the UAE which included a meeting with the Ruler of Furjairah, His Highness Sheikh Hamad al Sharqi, and dinner with local business leaders in Dubai, from the UK and UAE. Mr Burt also took part in a football match against the Brazilian embassy as part of an Olympic handover event, discussed law enforcement cooperation with the Dubai Attorney General Eissam Isa al Humaidan and visited the British University in Dubai to highlight the strength of British education institutions and education cooperation in the UAE.

In the early hours of 31st May the Israeli Defence Forces intercepted six of the eight boats sailing in the Free Gaza Flotilla. The incident led to injury and deaths for a number of passengers, mainly on one of the vessel. We await details of all the casualties and fatalities but it is clear that many will be Turkish citizens. The Prime Minister and I have spoken to the Turkish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister respectively to offer our condolences.

The six intercepted vessels were brought to shore in the Israeli port of Ashdod. Two of the boats have been delayed by mechanical difficulties and remain at sea. We believe they are en route to Gaza. I can inform the House that it appears now that a total of thirty seven British Nationals were involved in Sunday’s events, this is different from the number the Prime Minister gave a short time ago based on what the Israeli Ambassador had said before.

But I’ve spoken to our Ambassador in Tel Aviv in the last forty five minutes or so before coming in to the Chamber and the latest figures are of thirty seven British Nationals including eleven dual nationals. We’ve so far received access to twenty eight of these individuals, one of whom was deported yesterday. We understand that four more British nationals agreed to be deported this morning and that the remaining British Nationals are likely to be transferred to the airport soon.

We have expressed our disappointment to the Israeli Government about the levels of preparedness on their part and the fact that we have not yet been given full information about British Nationals detained and access to all of them. We are urgently pressing the Israeli Government to resolve this situation within hours.

There is real understandable and justified anger at the events which have unfolded. Mr Speaker, the position of the Government is as follows. Our clear advice to British nationals is not to travel to Gaza. However we have made clear in public and to the Israeli Government that we deeply deplore the loss of life and look to Israel to do everything possible to avoid a repeat of this unacceptable situation. The UN Security Council and the European Union have rightly condemned the violence with resulted in the loss of these lives. We have demanded urgent information about and access to all UK Nationals involved. Their welfare is our top priority at this time, along with support to their families who are understandably very worried.

We are seriously concerned about the seizure of British Nationals in international waters and this aspect of the Israeli operation must form a key part of the investigation into these events. The Prime Minister has spoken to the Israeli Prime Minister, I have spoken to the Israeli Foreign Minister and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, my Hon Friend the Member for North East Bedfordshire, has been in close contact with the Israeli Ambassador to London. The Embassy in Tel Aviv has been in constant contact with the Israeli authorities.

I am grateful to those Honourable and Right Honourable Members who have already been in contact with the FCO in relation to their constituents and their families and have provided information. We recognise the intense concern for those involved and the need to keep Members updated.

Israel has told us that they want to move as quickly as possible to deport those people from the flotilla currently held in Israel. If they agree they will be deported very quickly. Those who remain unwilling to leave will be allowed to stay for seventy two hours in detention, which is the time limit allowed for them to appeal against deportation. Our understanding is that after that they will be deported.

It is our understanding that the Israelis have also begun to transfer to Jordan detainees from countries that are not represented in Israel. We understand that those individuals who are allegedly involved in violence against Israeli servicemen during the boarding will have their cases examined in line with Israeli legal advice. We do not currently believe there are any British Nationals in this last category though I hope the House will appreciate that this is a fluid situation.

Our partners in the national, international community are working, as are we, to facilitate the swift release of those detained.  Turkey is sending six planes to fly out their nationals and the Turkish authorities have indicated that detainees of other countries may join these flights.  We believe that some of the British Nationals I referred to earlier are, are now on those flights.

The United Kingdom has played its full part in the European Union and United Nations in agreeing on the need for a full, credible, impartial and independent investigation into the events. Our goal is a process which ensures full accountability for the events which occurred and which commands the confidence of the international community, including international participation. Further discussions are taking place in other international fora, including at NATO and in the UN Human Rights Council. We will take the same principled stand across all our diplomatic efforts and stress to the Israeli Government the need for it to act with restraint and in line with its international obligations, given that its actions appear to have gone beyond what was warranted or proportionate. We need to know whether more could have been done to minimise the risks or to reduce the number of deaths and injuries.

Mr Speaker, the events aboard the flotilla were very serious and have captured the world’s attention. However they should not be viewed in isolation. They arise from the unacceptable and unsustainable situation in Gaza which is a cause of public concern here in the UK and around the world.  It has long been the view of the British Government, including the previous Government, that restrictions on Gaza should be lifted, a view confirmed in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1860 which called for sustained delivery of humanitarian aid and which called on states to alleviate the humanitarian and economic situation. That this has not happened is a tragedy. It is essential not only that there is unfettered access to meet the humanitarian needs of the people of Gaza but also to enable the reconstruction of homes and livelihoods and to permit trade to take place.

The Palestinian economy, whether in Gaza or the West Bank, is an essential part of a viable Palestinian state that I hope will one day live alongside Israel in peace and security. As the once productive private sector has been decimated and ordinary Gazans have lost their jobs and their incomes, it is tunnel entrepreneurs and their Hamas backers who benefit.

Hamas now has near total control of the economy. Other groups, even more radical and violent, are finding a place amid the misery and frustration felt by a generation of young people. In this context current Israeli restrictions are counterproductive for Israel’s long term security. We will therefore continue to press the Israeli Government to lift the closure of Gaza, Gaza and plan early discussions with Israel as well as our other international partners about what more can be done to ensure an unfettered flow of aid while ensuring that aid reaches those who need it and is not abused. I discussed this with Secretary Clinton last night and we will be taking forward discussions on this subject urgently.

The House should not forget the role played by Hamas in this conflict. They continue to pursue an ideology of violence and directly to undermine prospects for peace in the region. Violence has continued in recent day, with rocket fire from militants in Gaza and Israeli military incursions and airstrikes in response. We call on Hamas to make immediate and concrete steps towards to the Quartet principles; unconditionally to release Gilad Shalit who has been held in captivity for four years and end its interference with the operations of NGOs and UN agencies in Gaza.

Mr Speaker, it is today more clear than ever that the only long term and sustainable solution to the conflict which produced these tragic events is a two state solution that achieves a viable and sovereign Palestinian state living alongside a secure Israel with her right to live in peace and security recognised by all her neighbours. The proximity talks that are currently underway are more important than ever.  These events should not undermine these talks but instead underline just how important they are and the Government will make it an urgent priority to give British diplomatic support to buttress that process.

The Government will continue to keep the House informed of developments.",Demand for information and access to British Nationals,Administrative,,id25_423

He later visited the Intiñan Solar Museum, where he carried out several scientific experiments only possible in the equator.  Among those experiments were balancing an egg on the tip of a nail, which becomes easier in the equator due to magnetic forces cancelling each other out.  The Minister also witnessed how water runs to opposite sides depending on which hemisphere it is done, effect that is visible even with a difference of just a few feet.

On Monday, the Minister had a breakfast at hotel Plaza Grande with several political commentators, including Vicente Albornoz, Director of CORDES, Margarita Andrade, consultant in public finance, Jorge Cevallos, Executive Director of the International Centre for Research and Analysis of Public Policy, Teodoro Maldonado, legal advisor of Conecel, and Luis Hernandez, analyst of political and military affairs.  After breakfast he gave a short statement to Ecuadorean press.

After that, the Minister met Ecuador’s acting Foreign Minister Kintto Lucas at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where they discussed several bilateral issues.

He then attended an event to mark one-year-to-go to the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games at the residence of the British Embassy.  At the event, attended by members of the Ecuadorean sporting community and other important guests, the Minister gave a speech highlighting the importance of the Games and the relationship between the UK and Latin America, and awarded a certificate to Franklin Tenorio, Ecuadorean athlete already qualified for the London 2012 Olympic Games.  He also participated in a kick about with members of the Ecuadorean National Football Team, and received a “fast-walking lesson” with Ecuadorean Olympic Medalist Jefferson Perez.

Later on, the Minister supported BUPA’s work in Ecuador and their campaign to raise funds for Fundacion Corazones Valientes which supports children with cancer.  He unveiled a plaque recognising BUPA’s work in this area in the presence of the Deputy Mayor of Quito, Jorge Alban, and children and families supported by the Fundacion. As the Minister agreed to ride a bicycle down the “Chaquiñan” (trail), BUPA donated a further USD 1,500 to the Fundacion.

The Minister then cycled to the Cerveceria Nacional plant, where he heard about the company’s 10 point corporate social responsibility programme. He had a tour of the plant and learned about the environmental programme of Cerveceria Nacional  to use the minimum water necessary and recycle waste. The Minister gave a press conference after the two visits and stressed the importance of building up trade and investment relations with Ecuador.

These films give people from other countries the chance to tell us what they think about the UK - and viewers can find out about the lives of a range of people who live and work here. We’re interested in how others see the UK and have spoken to a wide range of people with links to Britain about their experiences.

The next of our short films features Jonathan Mills, the Australian Director of the Edinburgh International Festival. He set up home in the UK four years ago and describes Britain as a diverse, welcoming, open spirited and curious place - a far cry from a country sometimes perceived to be “up itself”. He believes Edinburgh in August epitomises these qualities, with a focus on celebrating culture on a significant scale. Watch the film below to find out more.



Since it first began after the Second World War, the Edinburgh Festival has become renowned as the epitome of cultural celebration, growing in popularity each year. Only the World Cup and Olympic Games sell more tickets. Jonathan attributes this success to the fact that since the Festival’s creation in 1947, people in the UK have enthusiastically opened their hearts and minds to it. They were and continue to be willing to share their culture and showcase that of others and then invite everyone along to see and enjoy it too.

Speaking from the Somalia capital Mogadishu the International Development Secretary set out how Britain will help improve the Government’s ability to manage its public resources while helping 20,000 Somalis benefit from better schools, sanitation, roads, health clinics and safety and security.

The Ministers outlined the support after meeting the Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. During that meeting, the President set out the priorities for his administration including the need for action to tackle corruption and improve transparency and accountability, and they discussed the wider development and security situation.

The International Development Secretary said:

“I congratulate the new President on his appointment. The recent peaceful transition of power shows that there is now a real opportunity to help the people of Somalia to grow and prosper. The UK is committed to working in partnership with the new government and the Somali Parliament to achieve this.

“For too long Somalia has been blighted by famine, piracy, terrorism or conflict. It is right that we help Somalia to tackle the underlying causes, which matter as much at home in Britain as they do in Somalia. Improving basic services such as justice, schools, health care and transport is vital if Somalia is to have a more peaceful and prosperous future.”During their visit, the Ministers are also holding talks with the Deputy Force Commander of the AU Mission in Somalia (AMISOM).

The Minister for Africa, Mark Simmonds said:

“I want to pay tribute to the bravery of AMISOM and the Somali National Security Forces. We discussed the advance of AMISOM and Somali forces with the Deputy Force Commander and the Kenyan Government. I welcome the progress made to increase the areas recovered from Al Shabaab control, including recent progress in Kismaayo.  It is clear that this will help create areas of stability, which will allow space for the return of basic services and for economic activity to resume. As the operation moves forward, it is essential that civilians are protected and that humanitarian access is assured.”

The joint visit follows the recent appointment of President Hassan Sheikh Mahmoud. The President has already stressed that his initial priorities will include security, economic recovery, improving delivery of basic services, strengthening the accountability of government and transparency of public finances.

Britain’s new aid package will help improve security and justice; public financial management; local governance for service delivery and public sector management across all areas of Somalia. It will allow 3,000 girls and women to access justice and help 20,000 Somalis access the schools, latrines, roads and health clinics to give them opportunities they need to pull themselves out of poverty. It will also improve security, safety and public financial management and make districts more accountable and responsive to communities’ needs.

Baroness Casey’s interim report into the culture and standards at the Metropolitan Police Service, published today (Monday 17 October 2022) raises significant concerns, including that fewer officers are being dismissed, officers with multiple allegations made against them are still serving the public and police from ethnic minorities are disproportionately represented in the misconduct system.

The Home Office review is likely to consider:

Working with policing partners, it will also assess whether the regulatory framework for the police disciplinary system should be changed.

Home Secretary Suella Braverman said:

“The public rightly expects the highest standards of behaviour from police officers and the vast majority meet this expectation. But recently too many high-profile incidents and reports, especially in London, have damaged trust - which is unfair on the public and lets down other serving officers.

“This cannot continue. Culture and standards in the police must improve. And where an officer has fallen seriously short of these expectations, demonstrable, public action must be taken.

“I have been clear it is absolutely vital police act to restore trust, return to common-sense policing and treat the public and victims with the respect they deserve.

“I welcome the Metropolitan Police’s commitment to tackling the issues raised in the Baroness Casey report and hope this review will also help to address underlying concerns.”

The government has already overhauled the police discipline system over the last 7 years, making it more transparent, more proportionate and more accountable – for example introducing public misconduct hearings in 2015 and bringing in the Police Barred List in 2017, ensuring that officers and staff who are dismissed cannot re-join the police.

In addition, the 2-part Angiolini Inquiry is currently examining the issues raised by the conviction of then-serving officer Wayne Couzens for the murder of Sarah Everard last year. The second part is expected to scrutinise wider issues for policing and the safety of women.

The agenda focused on foreign policy issues and the promotion of international trade.",Foreign & Commonwealth Office and The Rt Hon William Hague,17 September 2010,"At the meeting the UK urged EU leaders to back a major new trade partnership between Europe and Pakistan in the wake of the massive floods in the country.

The Prime Minister told the Summit that the scale of the disaster warranted a response far beyond the vital immediate humanitarian effort.

In the Summit conclusions, the European Union agreed to a comprehensive package of short, medium and longer term measures which will help underpin Pakistan’s recovery and future development.

Speaking at the closing press conference, the Prime Minister said:

“I think if you ask people in Pakistan and the leaders of Pakistan what is it that they want, is it aid or is it trade, they say very firmly they want greater market access, they want trade, and I am pleased that the European Union, with a very strong British lead here, has actually endorsed that approach.”

The Foreign Secretary added:

“We both put a lot of effort into Pakistan today, particularly trying to make sure that the measures that will be taken to open up market access to Pakistan to a greater extent into the EU are taken quickly and that there will not be a long process of delay in agreeing those measures of putting them into practice.”

Leaders at the Summit also agreed a free-trade agreement with South Korea which will ensure further free-trade agreements with other countries, including India, in the future.

The European Council also focused on economic governance and relations with the EU’s strategic partners and looked ahead to a number of upcoming events such as the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) next month.",Free-trade agreement with Pakistan,Legislative,,id25_433

Five key figures and an entity involved in the leadership and financial networks of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) are the subject of the UK’s new sanctions, which will help to cut off the flow of funding that supports these terrorist groups, including from Iran.

Today’s announcement is the third round of sanctions imposed on Hamas and PIJ by the UK following the 7 October attacks on Israel, which build on existing sanctions against the groups.

Foreign Secretary David Cameron said:

These sanctions send a clear message to Hamas – the UK and our partners are committed to ensuring there is no hiding place for those financing terrorist activities.

To reach a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza, Hamas can no longer be in power and able to threaten Israel. By disrupting the financial networks which sustain Hamas’ operation, including from Iran, these sanctions support that crucial aim.

The UK is committed to working with partners to tackle Iran’s destabilising activities in the Middle East, including its long-term support to terrorist and militant groups. Today’s sanctions target Zuheir Shamlakh, a man with an infamous reputation as Hamas’s ‘main money changer’ since 2019, and a key figure in the group’s shift towards cryptocurrencies.

Shamlakh exploited digital currencies and existing systems of informal money transfers to move large sums of money from Iran to Hamas ahead of the tragic 7 October attacks. This underground financial network uses legitimate businesses as a front to conceal the flow of terrorist funding.

Those now subject to UK asset freezes and targeted arms embargoes include:

The individuals are also subject to a travel ban, and will be unable to enter the UK.

The UK, along with our G7 partners, has committed to take action to deny Hamas the ability to raise and use funds to carry out atrocities. TheEU announced on Friday 19 January 2024 a new EU sanctions regime against Hamasand sanctioned 6 targets which had previously been sanctioned by the UK and US.

This is the third tranche of sanctions the UK has imposed against Hamas and its associates since 7 October under the UK’s International Counter-Terrorism sanctions regime. Previous packages have targeted other top-ranking officials and financiers of Hamas.

The Foreign Secretary continues to work with allies and partners to find a peaceful resolution to this conflict. During his visit to Davos last week the Foreign Secretary spoke with Israel’s President Isaac Herzog, Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, and Prime Minister of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq Masrour Barzani.

South Africans also drive on the same side of the road as the UK. However there are other driving challenges you should bear in mind when planning your journey.

South Africa is a vast country and the driving distances on straight roads can be lengthy. Journeys between World Cup venues can take up to 15 hours. You should aim to take regular breaks, and be prepared for driving in unfamiliar conditions.

Driving at night can be particularly difficult as most areas have little or no street lighting. Care should be taken, especially with animals potentially on the road and other vehicles driving without lights on.

Make sure you are prepared by taking out travel insurance and checking the local rules of the road. You should also remember to take your full driving licence.

“I look forward to discussing how we can support the Arab League further at the Friends of Syria meeting next week. I hope that the UN Secretary General will swiftly appoint a special representative to work alongside them.

The resolution asks Member States to promote the ideals of the Olympic Truce and the UK is the first Olympic Games host to use domestic and overseas activities to support the Truce.

Lord Bates’ passionate belief in the Olympic Truce has taken him on a fascinating journey, and many of the FCO’s Embassies have welcomed him along the way. They helped arrange meetings for him with government ministers; His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI; UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon; members of national Olympic Committees; and the International Olympic Committee President, Jacques Rogge.

Minister Henry Bellingham, the Minister responsible for Conflict Resolution at the FCO said:

“I would like to congratulate Lord Bates on the extraordinary achievement of walking from Olympia in Greece to London to highlight the UN resolution on the Olympic Truce. It has been an epic journey. The FCO agrees that the Truce is a very important way of promoting conflict resolution across the world and we are working on everything from the promotion of children’s rights in Ecuador to using sport to reduce gang violence in the Caribbean to achieve this.”

Lord Bates said:

“The Olympic truce provides an opportunity to remember that the point of the Ancient Olympic Games was the truce that transcended the sport. In the modern era much of that Ancient ideal has been lost, but the truce remains. I am proud that the British government is taking the lead to ensure that for London 2012 the truce is restored to its true position.”

Seb Coe, Chair of the London 2012 Organising Committee, said:

“Michael’s campaign to promote the Olympic Truce has been inspirational both in the House of Lords, and to all of us at the London 2012 Organising Committee. The Olympic and Paralympic Games are truly global events, with athletes from over 200 nations who will be pushing beyond their personal best when they are here in London. Michael has gone on a similar journey, and as we join him today at the Olympic Park we wish him well for the final leg of his impressive 3,000-mile effort.’’

This week talks are taking place in Doha between members of Syrian opposition groups. The United Kingdom, France, Turkey, the United States and other international partners will attend the meeting on 8th November.

Our objective is to encourage Syria’s opposition groups to unite around a vision for a democratic and stable Syria. This is necessary to offer the Syrian people a credible alternative to the Assad regime and to achieve an inclusive political transition that ends the appalling bloodshed and reflects the will of the Syrian people.

Last year I established the full time and dedicated role of Special Representative to the Syrian Opposition to coordinate our diplomatic contacts with opposition figures. Jon Wilks, the current incumbent, is attending the meeting in Doha.

We have taken gradual steps to establish and deepen contacts with new actors emerging in Syria. These include political opposition groups, local coordination groups working to deliver services in areas no longer under the full control of the regime, and human rights activists and civil society groups struggling for a free future for the country.

These contacts are essential if we are to deliver practical support to help save lives, to detect and seek to deter human rights violations and abuses, to increase the prospect of a political transition and to prepare the support Syria will need to recover from conflict. These efforts are particularly important in the absence of a British embassy in Syria. We discuss our work frequently with the Joint UN and Arab League Special Representative for Syria with the US, our regional allies and our European partners.

As well as increasing our development assistance to the Syrian people we have gradually increased our efforts to build the capacity and coordination of unarmed opposition groups inside Syria. This includes the provision of technical, non-lethal equipment such as radios and emergency power generators, as well as training journalists and civil society groups on human rights.

Earlier this year I instructed FCO officials to begin to make contacts outside Syria with political representatives of armed Syrian opposition groups. I informed the House of this on 3 September (Official Report: Vol. 549, Col. 54).

Such groups are playing an increasingly influential role within Syria as the conflict worsens. I have therefore now authorised my officials to have direct contact with an even wider range of representatives including military figures in the armed opposition. This will help us to understand better the situation in Syria and the relationship between political and armed opposition groups so we can properly support political transition.

All contacts will take place outside Syria, and then only in environments we deem suitably secure.  Each potential contact will be explored cautiously and on a case-by-case basis. Through continuous assessment, we will make every effort to ensure that FCO officials engage only with legitimate representatives of the opposition. We will continue to adhere to our clearly stated policy of only supplying non-lethal support to the unarmed opposition. All support is in compliance with both the EU arms embargo and our own stringent export licensing laws. In all contacts my officials will stress the importance of respecting human rights and international human rights norms, rejecting extremism and terrorism, and working towards peaceful political transition. British contacts with military elements of the Syrian armed opposition will be limited to a political dialogue including working towards and inclusive political transition.

The decision to engage with military representatives of the armed opposition in a political dialogue supports our efforts to achieve a peaceful and sustained political solution to the crisis as set out in the Geneva Communique, and avoid wider conflict.

I will keep the House informed of further developments relating to Syria.",Engagement with military representatives of the armed opposition in a political dialogue,Other,Informational,id25_445

“I condemn in the strongest terms yesterday’s violence in Ta’iz, which is reported to have killed twenty people, and injured many more. The Yemeni government and security forces must exercise restraint and fulfil their responsibility to protect the Yemeni people, and the fundamental rights and freedoms they are entitled to. They must hold to account those responsible for excessive use of force. The reach of international justice is long, and the regime should note this.

We and our partners in the Gulf region and elsewhere have repeatedly called on President Saleh to sign and implement the Gulf Cooperation Council Agreement. He must do this, if Yemeni lives are to be saved, and if the country is to have a chance of orderly transition.

I reiterate our clear message to British Nationals still in Yemen that they should leave immediately, while commercial flights are still operating. We cannot expect forewarning of any airport closures, and if the situation deteriorates, it would be extremely difficult for the British Government to assist its nationals in Yemen to reach safety.

It is important that the Union takes the necessary steps to ensure that we have robust systems that allow us to support the substantial deficit and debt reduction strategies now in place in Member States under the Stability and Growth Pact.

This discussion will take place against the backdrop of proposals from the Commission and the European Parliament for an increase in EU budget spending of around 6% in 2011.  These proposals are especially unacceptable at a time when we are having to take difficult decisions at national level to control public expenditure.

Speaking during his visit, he said:

“I was delighted to visit Hong Kong for the second time in less than eleven months.  My visits - and those of seven other Ministers, including Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne and Foreign Secretary William Hague in the intervening period - reflect the importance of Hong Kong and China to the coalition government.

“As the second largest market for UK exports in Asia, Hong Kong remains a top priority for the UK’s trade and investment interests.  I was happy to see first-hand the opportunities for even greater involvement of UK business in some of the landmark infrastructure projects that are underway. I also had an opportunity to discuss the Hong Kong authorities’ groundbreaking work in detecting and preventing digital theft. There is much scope for further co-operation between us in this area.

“I was also delighted I had an opportunity to speak to university students during my visit about the rights and freedoms that make Hong Kong such a special and unique part of China.”

Like so many others, we recall a turbulent decade that began with armies confronting each other across a divided Europe and ended with the Berlin Wall coming down, millions freed from the shackles of communism and human dignity extended across the continent.

The Cold War reached this conclusion because of the actions of many brave individuals and many strong nations, but we saw how the bond between our two countries – and our two leaders at the time – proved such a vital catalyst for change. It reminded us that when the United States and Britain stand together, our people and people around the world can become more secure and more prosperous.

And that is the key to our relationship. Yes, it is founded on a deep emotional connection, by sentiment and ties of people and culture. But the reason it thrives, the reason why this is such a natural partnership, is because it advances our common interests and shared values. It is a perfect alignment of what we both need and what we both believe. And the reason it remains strong is because it delivers time and again. Ours is not just a special relationship, it is an essential relationship – for us and for the world.

So as we meet today, facing immense economic, social and strategic challenges, it is natural that once again our two nations join together in common cause. Today the foundations of our partnership are rock solid. Our servicemen and women serve alongside one another, whether fighting in Helmand, protecting innocent people in Libya or combating piracy off the Horn of Africa. Every day our diplomats and security and intelligence agencies work together. We are working urgently to de-escalate tensions and prevent a return to war in Sudan’s contested Abyei region. And we are unified in our support for a lasting peace between a secure Israel and a sovereign Palestine.

And we can honestly say that despite being two leaders from two different political traditions, we see eye to eye. We look at the world in a similar way, share the same concerns and see the same strategic possibilities. So we will build on the relationship between the UK and US, working closely together on areas of common interest to make it stronger still.

One area where we need to co-operate is on rebuilding our economies. In the past few years, the global economy has gone through a profound shock. And what’s at stake now is whether new jobs and businesses take root in our countries or somewhere else. Now we are two different countries but our destination must be the same: strong and stable growth, reduced deficits and reform of our financial systems – so that they will never again be open to the abuses of the past.

Governments do not create jobs: bold people and innovative businesses do. We know that our nations are self-reliant and infused with the entrepreneurial spirit. We have proud traditions of out-innovating and out-building the rest of the world – and of doing it together. Today the US remains the largest investor in Britain, and Britain the largest investor in the US – each supporting around a million jobs in our countries. We want to encourage more of this exchange of capital, goods and ideas. So this week we will reaffirm our commitment to strong collaboration between our universities and research facilities.

We must also co-operate on ensuring our shared security. The death of Osama bin Laden marks the most significant blow against al-Qaeda since its inception – but it does not mark the end of the terror. Al-Qaeda and its affiliates will continue to pursue attacks against our countries so we must work together to protect our people from their poisonous ideology and the violence that flows from it. This means sharing information so we trace, track and disrupt terrorist plots – and bring those who plan them to justice. There can be no impunity and no refuge for those who wish to do us harm. And yes, this also means continuing our mission in Afghanistan, training the Afghan national army and police so they can provide security for their country, and our troops can come home.

But we also need to understand why people can become attracted to violent extremism in the first place. When young men and women feel that their rights are not respected, they can become more prone to the narrative of separateness and victimhood that al-Qaeda’s ideology feeds off. This is just one reason why recent events in the Arab world and Middle East are so momentous. What we are seeing there is a groundswell of people demanding the basic rights, freedoms and dignities that we take for granted. We all share in their success or failure.

Progress in the region will be uneven and it is not our place to dictate the pace and scope of this change. But we will stand with those who want to bring light into dark, support those who seek freedom in place of repression, aid those laying the building blocks of democracy. We do so because democracy and respect for universal rights is a good for the people of the region, and also because it’s a key part of the antidote to the instability and extremism that threatens our security. And we will not stand by as their aspirations get crushed in a hail of bombs, bullets and mortar fire. We are reluctant to use force but when our interests and values come together we know that we have a responsibility to act.

This is why we mobilised the international community to protect the Libyan people from Colonel Qadhafi’s regime. We have degraded his war machine and prevented a humanitarian catastrophe. And we will continue to enforce the UN resolutions with our allies until they are completely complied with. Our actions in Libya are not, and will never be, a burden our countries carry alone. We will work with partners so they share the load and the costs and continue to support the legitimate and credible Transitional National Council and its efforts to prepare for an inclusive, democratic transition. Together we show the world that the principles of justice and freedom will be upheld by all.

Our efforts against al-Qaeda – and our mission in Libya – are critical to the type of world that we want to build. Bin Laden’s ideology is one that has failed to take hold. Qadhafi’s reign represents the region’s past. We stand for something different. We see the prospect of democracy and universal rights taking hold in the Arab World, and it fills us with confidence and a renewed commitment to an alliance based not just on interests but on values. Yes, we are mindful of the risks and aware of the uncertainties. But we stand together, optimistic and confident that our two nations can achieve peace, prosperity and security in the years ahead.","Supporting the Transitional National Council and its efforts to prepare for an inclusive, democratic transition in Libya.",Institutional,,id25_459

Together we can end FGM/C in a generation.

This morning, on 6 February, DFID joined forces with more than 1000 supporters to raise awareness of FGM/C and campaign to end FGM/C in a generation.

At 11.30am a Thunderclap went out on various social media channels such as Facebook and Twitter, sending out the message to millions of people worldwide.

Read more about the campaign

The government has appointed a consortium of leading anti-FGM campaigners to deliver a global campaign to end FGM/C.

Those involved include:

The consortium will support the growing movement within Africa to end the harmful practice.

International Development Minister Lynne Featherstone said:

We will not see an end to FGM in the UK unless the practice is eliminated worldwide. This will take a grassroots movement across Africa that can change attitudes and help communities see FGM for what it is: child abuse.

This campaign will unite activists across Africa with UK diaspora communities and charities, raising awareness of the pain and suffering FGM causes and showing that we can end the practice.

The consortium will work across Africa to bring about a transformation in attitudes towards FGM by:

working with diaspora communities within the UK to help them use their skills and resources to support efforts to end FGM in their countries of origin

bringing together key leaders and organisations across Africa as part of a global movement to end FGM

promoting increased political will and funding in affected countries to tackle FGM

supporting a network of grassroots activists across Africa to speak out for change and supporting communities who are already working to end the practice

strengthening and supporting national coalitions against FGM within 10 focal countries, providing them with expertise needed to bring about change

The team will be based in Nairobi and London and is led by Efua Dorkenoo, OBE, former Advocacy Director of Equality Now’s FGM programme, and former technical expert for the WHO. The programme will work closely with the United Nations Joint Programme, governments and civil society in focal countries.

Esther was 8 years old when she was cut. Picture Jessica Lea/FDID

Female genital mutilation or cutting is exactly what it sounds like. It involves cutting or other damage to female genitalia and is a practice which has been carried out for thousands of years. It is a deeply embedded social norm that is done because it always has been. It is considered essential for marriage and preparation for womanhood.

Its most extreme form involves cutting out all the external genitalia and sewing up the girl’s vagina. This is carried out on 90% of girls in Somalia.

FGM/C results in a lifetime of pain, difficulties urinating and menstruating, pain during sex, serious problems in childbirth, physical disability and psychological damage.

More than 125 million girls and women have undergone FGM/C worldwide. The practice is widespread in Africa and parts of Asia.

30 million girls are at risk of being cut over the next decade, with 20,000 girls at risk in the UK every year.

Africa is leading the way in ending FGM/C. More and more communities, leaders, and policy makers are driving a movement to end it.

A UN General Assembly resolution led by the Africa Group called for a global ban on the practice in December 2012.

The First Lady of Burkina Faso, Chantal Compaore, played a vital role in driving the UN resolution and has been dedicated to ending FGM/C in her country for over 20 years.

The UK is working to reduce the practice by 30% in at least 10 countries in Africa in the next 5 years.

Change is happening. UNICEF and UNFPA report that nearly 10,000 communities abandoned the practice as of 2013. Evidence suggests that FGM/C can end in a generation.

On this International Day of Zero Tolerance against Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C), I call on everyone to unite in a global movement to prevent the next generation of girls from undergoing FGM/C. As we start on a new global social change campaign there is a real opportunity to break the cycle and end the practice.

I have been trailblazing efforts to end FGM/C for 3 decades, breaking boundaries and opening up the debate. In the early days, and in an unprecedented move, I helped move FGM/C from being seen as a cultural issue to a human rights issue. This led to the WHO denouncing the practice, stating that it should not be practiced by medical professionals under any circumstances. My work with the WHO’s secretariat to field their first resolution against FGM/C through the World Health Assembly in 1994 also helped them introduce the issue onto the agendas of Ministries of Health around the world.

The Government is committed to strengthening and reinvigorating Britain’s diplomatic network overseas.

On 11th May 2011 I announced plans to open six new Embassies and up to seven new Consulates General and to increase our diplomatic representation in more than twenty countries worldwide.

On 2 February 2012 I announced additional plans to open an Embassy in Liberia, and on 15 May 2012 I announced plans to open an Embassy in Laos and a British Interests Office in Burma in Naypyitaw.

Today, I can announce further steps to strengthen British diplomacy in Latin America and the Caribbean:

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office will now re-open the British Embassy in Paraguay which was closed in 2005, and we will establish British diplomatic representation in Haiti for the first time since 1966.

This builds on our decision to re-open the British Embassy in El Salvador which was closed in 2003 and the new British Consulate in the Brazilian city of Recife. It amounts to a considerable diplomatic advance in Latin America and the reversal of the previous Government’s policy of closing posts in the region.

Paraguay is the country with the largest economy in the world that does not have resident British diplomatic representation and was the fastest growing economy in South America in 2010.  This new Embassy will further strengthen British diplomatic engagement in the region. It will help to unlock commercial opportunities for British companies in this significant market. And it will allow us to work closely with Paraguay on regional issues such as counter-narcotics and organised crime.

The new British Embassy in Haiti will report to our Ambassador in the Dominican Republic. It will place us in a stronger position to support our objectives in Haiti and the region. The UK is a major contributor both to reconstruction and development in Haiti through multilateral agencies. We are also one of the major financial contributors to MINUSTAH, the UN peacekeeping operation. It is in Britain’s interest as a P5 member of the UN Security Council to play a more active role in guaranteeing stability and creating the conditions for growth and prosperity.

The strength of our overseas network is a signal to the world of our engagement and commitment to international peace and security. And our Posts themselves are the essential infrastructure of our country’s international influence and of our economic recovery. They provide an early warning system for threats to peace and security and assist British nationals in time of crisis. They support our economy and help British businesses, and they promote our values across the world.

The strengthening of our global diplomatic network will therefore remain a central objective of the Government. On current plans by 2015 we will have deployed 300 extra staff in more than twenty countries and we will have opened up to eleven new British Embassies and eight new Consulates or Trade Offices. I will keep the House informed of any further developments.",Opening of new Embassies and Consulates,Institutional,Administrative,id25_470

This was her first as UK Senior Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and her sixth visit as a British Minister.

During her visit Baroness Warsi met with President Zardari, Prime Minister Ashraf, Deputy Prime Minister Ellahi, Foreign Minister Khar and Defence Minister Qamar, and discussed the “UK-Pakistan Enhanced Strategic Dialogue”, improving bilateral relations, and strengthening democracy and human rights.



Baroness Warsi said:_“I am glad to be back in Pakistan, especially at such an important time. The upcoming elections are a crucial milestone in Pakistan’s democratic history, the first time in decades that there will have been a transfer of power from one civilian government to another. It is my hope that these elections will be a moment that people look back on and say this is when the trajectory of Pakistan changed.

“I believe that a strong, stable, constitutional democracy and a legitimate transfer of power in the upcoming elections are firmly in Pakistan’s interests. In all my meetings, I have stressed the need for all politicians to work towards elections that are free from violence and fraud, and for citizens to be able to vote without intimidation.  This will be vital to building citizen’s trust in the electoral process and the credibility of the resulting government.”_Baroness Warsi also met political leaders including the Chairman of Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz (PML-N) Mian Nawaz Sharif; the Chairman of Pakistan Tehrik e Insaf (PTI), Imran Khan;the Provincial President of Awami National Party (ANP), Senator Afrasiab Khattak; the President of the Pakistan Muslim League - Q, Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain; the Parliamentary leader of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), Farooq Sattar; and Ameer of Jamaat ul Islam - F, Maulana Fazlur Rehman.

During the visit Baroness Warsi highlighted the UK’s lasting commitment to Pakistan and said:

_“We encourage all political parties to use the start of the new parliamentary term, when political support is likely to be at its greatest, to tackle the challenges that Pakistan continues to face.

“The new government, whatever its makeup, will face some real challenges in its first 100 days that include a difficult economic situation and critical energy shortfalls.  In my meetings I committed the UK to working closely with Pakistan on these challenges.  Where appropriate, we can share our experiences of the need for tough budget decisions to deliver future growth and prosperity._

Commenting on the depth of the bilateral relationship Baroness Warsi said:

_“The UK and Pakistan have built a relationship based on mutual respect, interests and trust. In April 2011, the Prime Minister signed the “UK-Pakistan Enhanced Strategic Dialogue” to mark a new chapter in the relationship between our Governments and our peoples. Prime Minister Cameron called this a “Naya Aghaz”, forming an unbreakable bond of friendship between our two countries.

“In your fight against terrorism, our Prime Minister, David Cameron once said that “your enemy is our enemy” and I re-iterate that sentiment today. Pakistan has lost 30,000 citizens in that fight, the terrible attack on Malala is just one example of the human price Pakistan is paying.  The UK will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with Pakistan in the fight against terrorism.”

“Our bilateral relationship is going from strength to strength. We will continue to help Pakistan face its challenges and that support will not waver._

Baroness Warsi also visited the Election Commission of Pakistan, where she discussed the electoral process, voters registration and preparations for the general elections with Mr Ishtiak Ahmed Khan, Secretary of the Commission.

Following her meeting at the Election Commission of Pakistan, Baroness Warsi emphasised:

“We warmly welcome the proactive role played by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). Now the credibility of the elections will depend on all parties respecting its independence and the ECP Code of Conduct.”

Following her meetings with political party leaders, Baroness Warsi said:

_“We call on all political parties to ensure that elections are free from violence, intimidation, corruption and fraud. This is vital to building trust in the electoral process and the credibility of the future federal and provincial governments.

Democracy requires full participation from across all communities in Pakistan, particularly women, in determining their choice of government.”_","Call on all political parties to ensure that elections are free from violence, intimidation, corruption and fraud.",Informational,,id25_471

Highlighting the important work of human rights defenders, the theme for this year’s International Human Rights Day, the Foreign Secretary said:

“It is a pleasure to send this message of support on International Human Rights Day. This year we honour those who defend human rights around the world.

“Human rights are at the very heart of Britain’s foreign policy. We cannot have a foreign policy without a conscience, and we cannot achieve long term security and prosperity unless we uphold our values. We have to be resolute and determined in standing up for those who are denied the rights and freedoms we enjoy, while striving to be an inspiring example of them ourselves.

“So today we remember all those who champion the rights and freedoms of their fellow men and women, often at great personal cost:

“We remember in particular Liu Xiaobo who has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize but is imprisoned in China, and we call again for his release.

“We remember the more than 2,200 prisoners of conscience still unacceptably detained in Burma.

“We call on Iran to cease its harassment, intimidation and imprisonment of human rights defenders, and we call for justice for Nasrin Sotoudeh and others who share a similar plight.

“We remember the four people imprisoned this year in Vietnam for peacefully expressing their opinions, including the lawyer Le Cong Dinh.

“And we deplore the sentence of life imprisonment handed down to the human rights activist Mr Askarov in Kyrgyzstan, despite reports of significant flaws in the judicial process.

“Britain will raise these and other cases with governments around the world, ensuring that human rights are woven deeply into our foreign policy. Pursuing our enlightened national interest, we will remain true to our values while standing up for our own citizens.

More than 150 students from school and university groups discussed the need for a robust treaty which, for the first time would globally regulate controlling the arms trade. Mr Burt also spoke today at a seminar on the Arms Trade Treaty organised by the British Red Cross. The UK is working closely with civil society, including NGOs, the British defence industry and organisations like Amnesty and the British Red Cross. Their expertise and knowledge has helped inform the UK’s position.

Mr Burt said:

“The unregulated trade in conventional arms feeds conflict and undermines peace and security. Since 2006, the UK has been at the front of a global effort to introduce more effective and coherent international regulation of that trade.

“With less than two weeks to go to the start of the negotiations in New York, the Government remains committed to securing a robust, effective and legally-binding Arms Trade Treaty. Over the past six years, we have worked closely with NGOs like Amnesty International and Oxfam to achieve that aim. Events like today’s are particularly important because they give the Government the opportunity to hear what is important to those who share our vision for what an Arms Trade Treaty could achieve.”

The meeting was chaired jointly by Afghanistan’s Deputy Foreign Minister Jawed Ludin and the Senior Minister of State at the UK Foreign & Commonwealth Office Baroness Sayeeda Warsi.

The Joint Commission has been established to review implementation of the Enduring Strategic Partnership Document signed by President Karzai and Prime Minister Cameron on 28 January 2012, and will meet at least once a year.

Both sides recalled the historic achievements of the Afghan people since 2001, including in the areas of education, health, infrastructure and economic development, which have been achieved with support from Afghanistan’s regional and international partners, including the UK.

Both sides reaffirmed the importance of the Afghanistan-UK Partnership, and undertook to strengthen it in the years to come. They recalled that the Partnership is based on shared interests and objectives, as well as mutual respect between two sovereign states. They also emphasised that a peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan is in the interests of both countries and the region.

Both sides recalled the long-term commitments made by the international community at the Chicago and Tokyo Summits, which will help safeguard Afghanistan’s future security and development.  They also underlined the need to implement fully the Mutual Accountability Framework agreed in Tokyo.  Deputy Foreign Minister Ludin described Presidential Decree 45 of July 2012 as an important step in this direction.  Baroness Warsi reaffirmed the UK’s undertaking to contribute £70m a year towards the funding of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and to maintain its development funding at £178m a year until 2017.

Both sides reviewed the contribution being made by UK forces in Afghanistan, including the UK’s investment in training and mentoring the ANSF, and the UK’s support for the Afghan police. They especially welcomed last week’s ground-breaking ceremony for the Afghan National Army Officer Academy, which the UK is supporting. Baroness Warsi also reiterated the UK’s commitment to support Afghan efforts to further strengthen the rule of law, for example through the Criminal Justice Task Force, which has convicted over 2,500 drug traffickers in the last four years.

Deputy Foreign Minister Ludin outlined the Afghan government’s efforts to bring about lasting peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan. Deputy Foreign Minister Ludin welcomed the UK’s strong support for the Afghan peace and reconciliation efforts, including the trilateral discussion involving the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. In this context, both sides also noted the meetings on 19 July in Kabul and 26 September in New York between President Karzai, Prime Minister Cameron, and respectively Prime Minister Ashraf and President Zardari of Pakistan. Baroness Warsi congratulated the High Peace Council and Joint Secretariat on the organisation of last month’s Peace & National Unity Week, and recalled that the UK has contributed over £10m to the Afghan Peace & Reconciliation Programme.

Both sides noted the important role that regional co-operation must play in underpinning peace and prosperity in Afghanistan and stability in the region, and welcomed the valuable steps being taken as part of the Istanbul Process.

Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to the development of strong, transparent and accountable political institutions and to the protection of human rights, especially the rights of women. Deputy Foreign Minister Ludin reiterated Afghanistan’s determination to ensure inclusive, open and transparent Presidential elections in 2014.

Baroness Warsi announced that the UK had made contributions of £500,000 this year to both the Afghan Parliamentary Assistance Programme and the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission. She confirmed that the UK will contribute £12m for elections planning via the UN’s ELECT II programme. She also recalled that the UK has provided $2.3m in grants to 27 civil society bodies, 15 of them women’s organisations, in order to improve access to justice, and take forward peace building and conflict resolution activities across Afghanistan.

Both sides agreed to work together to support Afghanistan’s economic development and progress towards fiscal self-reliance. They noted the importance of attracting foreign investment and developing a vibrant private sector especially in sectors such as mining. They also emphasised the important role of anti-corruption efforts.

Both sides also reviewed the extensive co-operation between the UK and Afghanistan in the areas of culture, education, media and the arts.

The next meeting of the Joint Commission will take place in London in 2013.","Financial contributions (e.g., £70m a year towards ANSF, £500,000 to human rights commissions, grants to civil society bodies)",Welfare,,id25_475

The programme, backed in the first year by £200,000 in government funding, and delivered by the social enterprise Mental Health First Aid, will start with 1,000 staff and extend in years 2 and 3 to cover every secondary school in England. They will receive practical advice on how to deal with issues such as depression and anxiety, suicide and psychosis, self-harm, and eating disorders.

They will also be invited to become ‘first aid champions’, sharing their knowledge and experiences across schools and communities to raise awareness and break down stigma and discrimination.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said:

Teachers already provide outstanding pastoral care and support for their pupils, but many have said that they would appreciate more training on how to understand and respond to mental health issues.

We know that identifying symptoms of mental illness early can help young people on the road to recovery. This training will mean more children receive the timely and sensitive support they need to stay well.

One in 10 school-aged children will have a mental health condition at any time, with half of all mental health conditions beginning before the age of 14, making early intervention and support vital.

The introduction of Mental Health First Aid training supports the government’s pledge in the Queen’s Speech to improve mental health services and protect those living with mental health problems from unfair treatment and discrimination.

Earlier this year, the prime minister announced that every secondary school in the country would be offered the training, as part of a comprehensive set of messages to transform mental health support for children and young people.",Mental Health First Aid training,Administrative,Welfare,id25_477

“We’d had all sorts of road conditions on the journey, from half-decent mud-tracks to a brief section of pristine tarmac through the Chinese-developed oilfields to no road at all for the final three hours,” he recalls. “Thankfully, we had excellent Sudanese drivers. Then, just as it was becoming dusk, four lions jumped out in front of the vehicle.  It was great to see these rare members of Sudan’s large wildlife population, and a reminder of the breadth of security issues faced by the remote communities.”

The lions proved no obstacle to getting the job done: “they were probably as surprised to see us as we were to see them.”

The mission - conducting a series of local consultations on a multi-donor (including UK) funded Community Security and Arms Control programme - continued. For ten days, Garside with United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and national colleagues, lived in mud huts, eating the local diet of fried goat and bread, and were well looked after. “We had very friendly hosts and were welcomed wherever we went by the local authorities.”

The Juba-based Stabilisation Advisor is deployed by the UK government’s Stabilisation Unit, which is co-owned by the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development.  The FCO has had a presence in Juba, the capital of Southern Sudan, since 2006.  There is now a growing UK Government team in Juba, including FCO and DFID staff, which is set to expand considerably later this year with new offices and accommodation under a DFID platform.

Garside has a wide-ranging brief of analysing, reporting and advising on stabilisation-related issues and programmes. It is little surprise, then, that his day-to-day role is so varied. As an example, he recently visited the state of Jonglei to see the first Livestock Patrol Unit (LPU) on parade at their graduation in the state capital of Bor.

“Cattle raiding in Jonglei is a major problem, primarily between tribes. Cattle represent status and wealth, a bank from which you tend not to spend other than for a dowry. A lot of the raiding occurs during the dry season, when herders move their cattle to areas where there is water and pasture. With many herder groups merging in similar locations, it is easier to steal. When the rains come, they go back to their original villages, taking as many cattle with them as possible. Cattle raiding is violent and particularly in Jonglei, it often includes raids on villages.”

Recruited from young men and women who are neither police nor military, the members of the LPU are trained by UN police, learning everything from investigating incidents, basic military patrolling skills and some human rights law, “for example, protecting arrested raiders from angry villagers seeking revenge” Garside says.

Most of Southern Sudan remains remote and access can be extremely difficult. “In two of the three counties we visited, we were told this was the first consultation they had ever had,” Garside says of the Upper Nile State field visit. “The consultations are an inclusive process with administrators, security officials, traditional chiefs and elders, women and youths all well represented. The process is good at drawing out the causes of insecurity rather than the symptoms. Subsequently, the provision of water points, education and vocational training schemes were prioritized. All of this was fed into a substantial report and community projects will be implemented as a result.”

With 20 years in the British Army behind him including much Sudan experience, Garside, who is part of the Civilian Stabilisation Group’s database of around 1,000 Deployable Civilian Experts, was well prepared for a role that requires travel to the ten states that make up Southern Sudan.

“With the UN mission and a large international effort in Southern Sudan it is so important to make in-country visits in order to assess the situation and the impact and effect we are having. Being the first donor representative to accompany the programme in Upper Nile State gave the UK a lot of credibility.”

Garside says he was attracted to the Stabilisation Unit by the broad range of short- and long-term deployments it offered, together with a good deal of interesting short-notice work. Having worked on the East Africa portfolio while seconded to the UN, he jumped at the chance of returning to Sudan as a Stabilisation Advisor.

“Getting out and about in a country with so little infrastructure is a challenge,” he says, remarking that he relies on UN or NGOs to provide logistical support for his visits. “Once you are on the ground, there are plenty of interlocutors to visit who are all willing to talk and present their perspective on the situation. These people are a vital source of information which we need to appreciate,” he says.

For many Sudan observers, all eyes are on January 2011, when a referendum will be held that will determine whether Southern Sudan becomes an independent state.

“The referendum is the key milestone in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement so we are building to a critical period,” says Garside. “It’s not our vote and we don’t have a say, of course. However, we are working to ensure the best possible peace, whatever the outcome of the vote.”",Referendum (Comprehensive Peace Agreement),Legislative,,id25_480

“I am delighted to return to India. I am very grateful to my new counterpart, His Excellency, Shri Salman Khurshid, for the warm welcome he has extended to me today. I am pleased to be among the first Foreign Ministers to have the chance to discuss with him the many pressing challenges that we face together.

“On our election in May 2010, the British government made clear that we would invest significantly in many ways in the UK-India relationship to build a stronger, wider and deeper partnership together. For us this is an essential pillar in our broader strategy to build far closer relations with the powers of the South and the East in the world. As I have often said, I believe that the 21st century more than any previous period will be shaped by India.

“Since 2010, our partnership has truly become stronger, wider and deeper. We are on course to hit our target of doubling trade by 2015. British companies are leading the way, investing in India in key sectors such as energy, telecommunications and education. The largest single foreign investments into India are British, by Vodafone and BP. This is a two-way process. Indian companies have chosen to invest more in the UK than in the rest of the EU combined and with great success, as Tata’s investments in companies such as Jaguar Land Rover have shown.

“Beyond business, the finest minds in our two countries are increasingly working together for the benefit of both our nations, and for the world. Our government-led joint research funding has now passed £100 million compared to £1 million three years ago. I am delighted that each year over 30,000 ambitious young Indians choose the UK for their higher education. As home to four of the world’s top ten universities, I am confident that Britain offers these students the very best in their pursuit of knowledge. I am also pleased by the progress we are making to strengthen our civil nuclear co-operation, both commercially and through our research institutions.

“We have also agreed a communique to steer our future cooperation on cyber security. This agreement confirms our shared commitment to the core principles of liberty, transparency, freedom of expression and the rule of law in cyberspace.

“Our diplomatic networks play a vital role in creating opportunities for partnership. Since 2010, we have agreed to open two new Deputy High Commissions in Hyderabad and Chandigarh. The British diplomatic presence in India is now more extensive than that of any other nation. We hope to develop this further over the coming years. And our recent decision to re-engage with the Government of Gujarat now offers us the chance to strengthen our ties across the breadth of India.

“Our partnership is not limited to co-operation on British or Indian soil. We have worked increasingly closely together on matters of international security, not only on cyber security but also in areas such as counter-terrorism, and the security of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear materials. We have also worked closely together with India during her tenure on the United Nations Security Council, and we look forward to the time when she takes up a permanent seat. We also support Indian membership of the international export control regimes.

“I know we will discuss a range of foreign policy issues including Afghanistan and other issues in India’s neighbourhood, where we greatly value India’s counsel and co-operation. We will also discuss the situation in Syria where the British Government is appalled by the regime’s brutal repression which has led to more than 30,000 people losing their lives. I welcome India’s support for a stronger role for the UN in bringing an end to the violence. We are both committed to pursuing a peaceful political transition and working together to support the work of UN-Arab League Special Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi in his efforts to achieve this.

“So ours is a genuine partnership of equals between the UK and India that we have done a lot to build up over the past two and a half years. There are many more exciting opportunities and we look forward to taking this to the next stage, and to being a partner of choice for India in many areas over the years to come.”",Agreement to open two new Deputy High Commissions,Institutional,,id25_481

Cardinal Bertone. Those present included a number of senior British Government Ministers and senior officials from the Holy See. The discussion covered a range of areas of shared interest between the UK Government and the Holy See.

Her Majesty’s Government and the Holy See share a commitment to bringing an end to poverty and underdevelopment. On the eve of a summit in New York to review progress towards implementing the Millennium Development Goals, they share the conviction that more needs to be done to address the unnecessary suffering caused by hunger, disease and illiteracy. Strong political leadership and respect for the ethos of local communities are necessary in the promotion of the right to life, food, health and development for all.

The British Government and the Holy See share a conviction of the urgent need for action to address the challenge of climate change. Action is needed  at every level from the governmental to the individual  if we are to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to set in motion the transition to a global low-carbon economy, and to assist poor and vulnerable countries to adapt to the impacts of climate change that are already inevitable.

There was a good exchange of views on a variety of social and economic issues, recognising the role played by faith in the lives of individuals and as part of the fabric of a strong, generous, tolerant society.

The visit of Pope Benedict XVI provided the opportunity to develop a deeper exchange of views between the Holy See and the UK Government.

Theresa May, the Home Secretary, said:

‘This is a hugely important post. Protecting our border effectively is absolutely critical to the work of the Home Office. Rob brings a wealth of experience to the department and I look forward very much to working with him.’

Rob Whiteman said:

‘I am honoured and excited to be appointed to UKBA which carries out such a vital role. I am looking forward to taking up post and meeting staff and managers throughout the Agency and the organisations we work with to deliver excellence.’

Details of the scheme were announced today, as the home secretary revealed almost 5,000 female mentors have joined the government’s drive to kick-start growth by encouraging more women to start or build their own companies.

Home secretary and minister for women and equalities Theresa May said: ‘Women are vital to Britain’s economic future and the support of a mentor will help even more of them fulfil their true potential.

‘The government is working hard to help women make the most of their talents, but we cannot act alone. I’m delighted by these mentors’ commitment to helping budding businesswomen succeed - and to making Britain prosper.’

Equalities minister Lynne Featherstone said: ‘Britain has many talented women who will thrive as these rural growth networks give them the tools they need to launch or develop their own businesses.

‘Women are about half as likely as men to become entrepreneurs and we need to harness their untapped skills. Living in a rural area can also present specific challenges that these projects aim to address.’

The Swindon and Wiltshire local enterprise partnership (LEP) is one of five across the country which will benefit from government funding for rural growth networks to provide tailored support to tackle the barriers that businesswomen face in the area.

Enterprising military wives will be given a helping hand as the LEP focus on helping people in the armed forces and their partners succeed in business.

Other inspiring women in the region who could benefit include Diana Short, 43, who created award-winning chocolate company lick the spoon in Corsham after quitting a successful career as a chef to work for herself when she became a mum. Green entrepreneur Juliet Davenport, who founded the UK’s only 100 per cent renewable electricity supplier good energy in Chippenham, also welcomed the additional support.

If women started businesses at the same rate as men there would be an additional 150,000 start-ups a year, and if female entrepreneurship reached the same levels as the US it would contribute an extra £42 billion to the economy.

The £2 million has been allocated to projects dedicated to women as part of a £15 million package of support for the five rural growth networks from the department for environment, food and rural affairs that is expected to create more than 3,000 new jobs and 700 businesses.

Environment secretary Caroline Spelman said: ‘Women who want to go back to work or set up their own company should not be held back by living in remote places. We want to help all women across the country turn their great business ideas into profitable rural businesses.

‘Rural growth networks will create thousands of new jobs and hundreds of start-up companies by fixing problems rural businesses face, like a shortage of work premises and limited internet access.’

The home secretary also announced updates to a range of additional support for women in business:

Case studies of women who will benefit are available from the home office press office.

The Swindon & Wiltshire local enterprise partnership (LEP) plans to use the rural growth networks funding to:- focus on military personnel and their partners;- provide specialist advisors, mentoring and coaching support;- establish a local women’s business network to provide incubator and start-up units specifically tailored to women. These units will offer a ‘virtual assistant’ service to provide administrative support; and- offer skills development, which will include access to finance and business planning.

For more details on the projects contact Steve Richards at LEP on 07748 658230.

2. Mentoring

Case studies and quotes from the mentoring champions are available from the home office press office.

The home secretary pledged to fund the recruitment and training of 5,000 female mentors last November. This is on top of 10,000 (male and female) mentors subsequently announced by the department for business.

Training can be accessed through free workshops or online and distance learning.

Free training will be open to volunteers new to mentoring, those who run their own business with 250 employees or fewer, are business support professionals, or work for a company employing fewer than 250 people.

Mentors are asked to provide a minimum of one hour free business mentoring a month to an owner of a micro, small, or medium sized business over the next two years (or equivalent).

4. Women’s business council

The women’s business council has started a year-long probe into how to increase women’s contribution to the economy by identifying the issues they face and finding practical solutions.

The council is today announcing its plan of work. It will use its business expertise to look at women’s entire working life - including education, finding a job or starting a business, juggling childcare and a career, succeeding in senior roles and preparing for retirement. Crucially, the WBC will examine from a business perspective how these issues affect employers’ ability to hire the talent they need.

Women’s business council chair Ruby McGregor-Smith said:

‘This is an exciting opportunity to make a real difference to women’s lives, to business success and to economic growth. We are looking at the entire life-cycle to see what holds women back and what government, business and others can do to address this.’

5. Access to finance

The government is undertaking a review into claims that women are being discriminated against by banks in their lending decisions.

Deputy prime minister Nick Clegg commissioned the equalities minister, Lynne Featherstone, to review the claims made by a 2011 IPPR report called ‘women and banks - are female customers facing discrimination?’. Lynne Featherstone is working with the british bankers’ association, the council for mortgage lenders and other industry bodies to identify actions to address this critical area and ensure female entrepreneurs are confident they have the same access to funds as their male counterparts.

Equalities minister Lynne Featherstone said:

‘It is completely unacceptable if banks are discriminating against women. Women should receive exactly the same service in accessing financial help as their male counterparts. We are working with the british bankers’ association and other industry representatives to identify what can be done by the financial sector to support women and to set out an action plan. Greater transparency by lenders in the way they go about their business is needed to ensure women have confidence to access the finance they need without the fear of being discriminated against.’

A parallel review on business lending to ethnic minority entrepreneurs and businesses is being conducted by the department for communities and local government.

6. Equal pay audits

Equalities minister Lynne Featherstone announced a new safeguard on equal pay last week which will give employment tribunals the power to require an employer who loses an equal pay case to carry out a pay audit, where there is likely to be systemic discrimination.

The draft code, launched today, is based on the principle of surveillance by consent - meaning the public can be confident that cameras are not there to spy on them but to protect them and help in the fight against crime.

It will give the public the power to hold the police and local authorities to account through greater transparency and is designed to improve the effectiveness of CCTV and automatic number plate recognition (ANPR).

The code will provide straightforward guidance, helping the police and local authorities to increase image quality and boost the chances of catching criminals. It comes after Andrew Rennison was appointed as the first surveillance camera commissioner in September 2012.

Minister for criminal information Lord Taylor of Holbeach said:

‘Used effectively CCTV and ANPR are crucial tools for cutting crime and protecting the public but for too long we have seen these systems grow and develop without any proper framework or oversight.

‘Through this code of practice, and with an independent commissioner, we will ensure that for the first time there is a robust framework in place, one focused on helping the police and local authorities to cut crime, which will ensure CCTV and ANPR are used appropriately.’

The consultation, which runs until 21 March, will seek views on the scope and clarity of the draft code and its likely impact. The creation of the code is a requirement of the protection of freedoms act 2012.

1. After due consideration is given to the consultation responses, the code of practice is expected to come into effect in summer 2013.

Ministers have always been clear that the exploration of England’s shale gas reserves could only proceed if the science shows that it is safe, sustainable and of minimal disturbance to those living and working nearby. For that reason, government introduced tight planning controls through the Infrastructure Act 2015 and set strict limits on seismicity, in consultation with industry.

On the basis of the disturbance caused to residents living near Cuadrilla’s Preston New Road site in Lancashire and this latest scientific analysis, the government has announced a moratorium on fracking until compelling new evidence is provided.

The government also confirmed today that it will not be taking forward proposed planning reforms for shale gas developments at this time. These proposals were consulted on in 2018 but will not be implemented now.

Business and Energy Secretary Andrea Leadsom said:

Whilst acknowledging the huge potential of UK shale gas to provide a bridge to a zero carbon future, I’ve also always been clear that shale gas exploration must be carried out safely. In the UK, we have been led by the best available scientific evidence, and closely regulated by the Oil and Gas Authority, one of the best regulators in the world.

After reviewing the OGA’s report into recent seismic activity at Preston New Road, it is clear that we cannot rule out future unacceptable impacts on the local community.

For this reason, I have concluded that we should put a moratorium on fracking in England with immediate effect.

Other sources of natural gas will continue to contribute to the UK’s diverse energy mix. The Committee on Climate Change has previously said that there will still be a requirement for natural gas in a 2050 net zero economy.

Maintaining diverse gas supplies, for use during the transition as the UK renewable sector grows – or for the production of hydrogen – remains a priority for this government.

Business, Energy and Clean Growth Minister Kwasi Kwarteng said:

The Committee on Climate Change’s advice is clear that natural gas will continue to have a key role to play as we eliminate our contribution to climate change by 2050, including for the production of hydrogen. However, following our action today, that gas will need to come from sources other than domestic fracking.

Today’s decision will not in any way impact our energy supply. The UK benefits from one of the most active gas markets in the world, with security ensured through diverse sources - including domestic offshore production, pipelines from Europe and liquid natural gas terminals.

The Traffic Light System was introduced in 2012 as an evidence-based method of regulating seismicity caused by shale gas exploration. It has operated at Preston New Road, allowing the OGA to swiftly put a halt to activity when required – including after several significant events this summer.

Oil and Gas Authority Director of Regulation Tom Wheeler said:

Since the OGA suspended hydraulic fracturing at Preston New Road we have been considering whether the operator’s plans are still appropriate to manage the risk of induced seismicity. The OGA’s considerations have been informed both by the seismic events and by independent scientific analysis of data from the first Preston New Road well.

Based on these, the OGA believes that further detailed geomechanical analysis would be needed before we could evaluate with confidence whether hydraulic fracturing could resume in the Fylde, or elsewhere, consistent with the government’s policy aims.",Moratorium on fracking,Administrative,Legislative,id25_497

Details of the scheme were announced today, as the home secretary revealed almost 5,000 female mentors have joined the government’s drive to kick-start growth by encouraging more women to start or build their own companies.

Home secretary and minister for women and equalities Theresa May said:

‘Women are vital to Britain’s economic future and the support of a mentor will help even more of them fulfil their true potential.

‘The government is working hard to help women make the most of their talents, but we cannot act alone. I’m delighted by these mentors’ commitment to helping budding businesswomen succeed - and to making Britain prosper.’

Equalities minister Lynne Featherstone said:

‘Britain has many talented women who will thrive as these rural growth networks give them the tools they need to launch or develop their own businesses.

‘Women are about half as likely as men to become entrepreneurs and we need to harness their untapped skills. Living in a rural area can also present specific challenges that these projects aim to address.’

The Coventry and Warwickshire Local Enterprise Partnership is one of five across the country which will benefit from Government funding for Rural Growth Networks to provide tailored support to tackle the barriers that businesswomen face in the area.

Enterprising military wives will be given a helping hand as the LEP focus on helping people in the armed forces and their partners succeed in business.

Inspiring women in the region who could benefit include Sophie Howe, 33, who bought back her mum Isabella’s old company, Comtec Translations in Leamington Spa, and together they have tripled the size of the business in five years.

If women started businesses at the same rate as men there would be an additional 150,000 start-ups a year, and if female entrepreneurship reached the same levels as the US it would contribute an extra £42 billion to the economy.

The £2 million has been allocated to projects dedicated to women as part of a £15 million package of support for the five rural growth networks from the department for environment, food and rural affairs that is expected to create more than 3,000 new jobs and 700 businesses.

Environment secretary Caroline Spelman said:

‘Women who want to go back to work or set up their own company should not be held back by living in remote places. We want to help all women across the country turn their great business ideas into profitable rural businesses.

‘Rural growth networks will create thousands of new jobs and hundreds of start-up companies by fixing problems rural businesses face, like a shortage of work premises and limited internet access.’

The home secretary also announced updates to a range of additional support for women in business:

The home secretary pledged to fund the recruitment and training of 5,000 female mentors last November. This is on top of 10,000 (male and female) mentors subsequently announced by the department for business.

Training can be accessed through free workshops or online and distance learning.

Free training will be open to volunteers new to mentoring, those who run their own business with 250 employees or fewer, are business support professionals, or work for a company employing fewer than 250 people.

Mentors are asked to provide a minimum of one hour free business mentoring a month to an owner of a micro, small, or medium sized business over the next two years (or equivalent).

The women’s business council has started a year-long probe into how to increase women’s contribution to the economy by identifying the issues they face and finding practical solutions.

The council is today announcing its plan of work. It will use its business expertise to look at women’s entire working life - including education, finding a job or starting a business, juggling childcare and a career, succeeding in senior roles and preparing for retirement. Crucially, the WBC will examine from a business perspective how these issues affect employers’ ability to hire the talent they need.

Women’s business council chair Ruby McGregor-Smith said:

‘This is an exciting opportunity to make a real difference to women’s lives, to business success and to economic growth. We are looking at the entire life-cycle to see what holds women back and what government, business and others can do to address this.’

The government is undertaking a review into claims that women are being discriminated against by banks in their lending decisions.

Deputy prime minister Nick Clegg commissioned the equalities minister, Lynne Featherstone, to review the claims made by a 2011 IPPR report called ‘women and banks - are female customers facing discrimination?’. Lynne Featherstone is working with the british bankers’ association, the council for mortgage lenders and other industry bodies to identify actions to address this critical area and ensure female entrepreneurs are confident they have the same access to funds as their male counterparts.

Equalities minister Lynne Featherstone said:

‘It is completely unacceptable if banks are discriminating against women. Women should receive exactly the same service in accessing financial help as their male counterparts. We are working with the british bankers’ association and other industry representatives to identify what can be done by the financial sector to support women and to set out an action plan. Greater transparency by lenders in the way they go about their business is needed to ensure women have confidence to access the finance they need without the fear of being discriminated against.’

A parallel review on business lending to ethnic minority entrepreneurs and businesses is being conducted by the department for communities and local government.

Equalities minister Lynne Featherstone announced a new safeguard on equal pay last week which will give employment tribunals the power to require an employer who loses an equal pay case to carry out a pay audit, where there is likely to be systemic discrimination.

He outlines the government’s support for police officers and sets out plans for the creation of a Police Professional Body to ensure that officers have the right skills and training for the future. He also reminds officers of the work the Government has done to end centralised targets, cut bureaucracy and restore discretion.

On changes to pay and conditions, he states that it is right in principle to reward officers for the job they do and the skills they have rather than time served. But he emphasises that the government will take great care to ensure that police officers are fairly treated.

Mr Herbert said: ‘As a service spending some £14 billion a year it is right for the police to make their contribution to reducing the record budget deficit.

‘Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary has set out that forces can make savings of over £1 billion a year while maintaining the service to the public. The two-year pay freeze and better procurement will help to make further savings.

‘Existing police pay and conditions were designed more than 30 years ago which is why we asked Tom Winsor to carry out his independent review based on the principle that pay should reflect an officer’s job, skills and hard work, rather than simply time served. These changes are currently subject to formal negotiations.

‘The pay freeze and pension changes are applying across the public sector, but we will continue to ensure that police officers are rewarded for the exceptional job they do.’

This means Romanian and Bulgarian (A2) nationals seeking to work in the UK will continue to require permission from the UK border agency before they can work in the UK.

Immigration Minister Damian Green said:

‘Maintaining these controls will make sure migration benefits the UK and does not adversely impact on our labour market. The government is radically reforming the immigration system, and has already announced an annual limit on work visas and tough new rules for students to ensure net migration is reduced from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands.

‘The migration advisory committee has made a clear case for extending the existing restrictions on Bulgarians and Romanians. This government has also made clear that we will always introduce transitional controls on all new EU member states as a matter of course.’The decision supports the government’s commitment to reduce employers’ dependence on migrant workers, particularly for lower skilled jobs. This will help the unemployed to find their way back into work and help the domestic workforce to acquire the skills the economy needs.

A report from the independent migration advisory committee (MAC) looked at the impact on the domestic labour market if the transitional controls were removed. It found that lifting the current restrictions could cause more A2 nationals to come to the UK to work, particularly in lower skilled occupations where there is greater risk of displacement of resident workers and a negative impact on wages.

Permission to work will normally be given only where the worker has a specific job offer and the work is in skilled employment for which the employer has been unable to find a suitably qualified resident worker. There are also quota-based arrangements for lower skilled jobs in the agricultural and food processing sectors which will stay at the same level for 2012 and 2013.

1. The migration advisory committee’s report into A2 (Bulgarian and Romanian) nationals was released on 4 November 2011 and can be found here:http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/aboutus/workingwithus/mac/-restrictions-worker1/

2. Migration should deliver economic benefit to the UK. Transitional restrictions have been in force since 1 January 2007. They restrict Bulgarian and Romanian nationals to employment that is either skilled or is in sectors where there continues to be a shortage of labour.

3. Workers from Romania and Bulgaria may also take part in the seasonal agricultural workers scheme (SAWS). The annual quota for SAWS will continue at 21,250 places for 2012 and 2013 and the annual quota for the sectors based scheme (SBS) will continue at 3,500 places for 2012 and 2013.

4. The extension of the restrictions does not affect the position of those who have already been authorised to take employment in the UK.

5. Under European law the current restrictions cannot continue beyond the end of 2013 and will therefore be lifted at that point.

There are a lot of myths about what this means to the UK. Find out the truth here.,Home Office and The Rt Hon Theresa May,27 July 2010,"The European Investigation Order (EIO) is designed to cut bureaucracy and reduce delays by creating a standardised request form for all EU countries to use.

States will also now have to meet deadlines when providing evidence of crimes to other EU countries. This is in order to prevent delays to criminal prosecutions.

Home Secretary Theresa May said, ‘The European Investigation Order will prove to be an invaluable tool in the fight against transnational, international and serious organised crime. We believe - as do prosecutors and the police - that the European Investigation Order will greatly benefit the UK criminal justice system, without compromising civil liberties.’

There’s a lot of conflicting information about the EIO in the media. Here are some myths you might come across, and the facts.

Myth: EU countries could instruct UK police

Truth: UK officers will maintain their operational independence.

Myth: Foreign police will have access to individual records, for example on the national DNA database and bank records

Truth: Foreign authorities will not be able to access such databases directly. To access personal information through our police there must be an obvious link between the person and the alleged crime. Any processing of personal data, such as DNA, would have to be in accordance with our Data Protection Act and the European Convention on Human Rights, and must be both justified and proportionate.

Myth: Foreign authorities will be able to demand the ID of every British citizen who flew to the country in the month an offence took place

Truth: To access personal information through our police there must be an obvious link between a person and any alleged crime. Any processing of personal data, such as DNA, would have to be done in accordance with our Data Protection Act and the European Convention on Human Rights, and must be both justified and proportionate

Myth: foreign officials will be able to travel to the UK and immediately assume the powers of UK police

Truth: Foreign police would have no law enforcement powers in the UK. The EIO will only allow foreign police forces to request that their officers are present during the execution of an EIO by UK officers in order to ensure that any evidence gathered would be admissible in their justice systems.  This would represent no change from the current system.

Myth: The police would be obliged to conduct a search for evidence of crimes that aren’t actually crimes in this country

Truth: The UK would be able to refuse a search request where the crime isn’t recognised as a crime here. This is the same position as under the current system.

Myth: This will place unreasonable demands on police

507,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ofsted-chief-inspector-calls-for-rapid-improvement-in-literacy,Press release,Ofsted Chief Inspector calls for rapid improvement in literacy,"Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, issues a national challenge to drive up stalled standards of literacy and English.",Ofsted,15 March 2012,"Addressing a group of outstanding teachers and literacy experts in London he will recognise the improvements that have been made, but say national progress on literacy has stalled and the country is being overtaken by other leading nations.

Sir Michael will say that one in five children do not achieve the expected literacy levels by the end of primary school – 100,000 pupils last year alone – rising to one in three pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. One in seven adults, as many as five million people, lack basic literacy skills.

The problem is evidenced by an Ofsted report launched today,Moving English Forwardwhich has found that while in many schools English teaching is effective and pupils make good progress, standards in English are not high enough and, since 2008, there has been no overall improvement in primary pupils’ learning.

Speaking at Thomas Jones School, Ladbroke Grove, Sir Michael is expected to say:

There can be no more important subject than English. It is at the heart of our culture and literacy skills are crucial to pupils’ learning for all subjects. Yet too many pupils fall behind in their literacy early on. In most cases, if they can’t read securely at seven they struggle to catch up as they progress through their school careers. As a result, too many young adults lack the functional skills to make their way in the modern world. We are no longer a leading country in terms of our literacy performance: others are doing better.

We don’t need more research or more headline-grabbing initiatives which can’t be sustained. Good leadership is the key to good literacy in schools. Above all, this means being passionate about high standards of literacy for every single pupil, and creating a no-excuses culture both for pupils and for staff.

I am confident we can get to grips with this issue. I am determined that Ofsted will focus more sharply on literacy in our inspections, and I am proposing ten specific steps to raise national standards in literacy.

Sir Michael will emphasise that strong leadership is the key to good literacy in school. This means investing in and leading the professional development of staff in the systematic teaching of phonics; carefully tracking every pupil’s progress in literacy, especially at transition between the Key Stages; and structured intervention when pupils start to fall behind.

He will note that even achieving the current benchmark at the end of primary school is no guarantee of success. Last year 45% of pupils who achieved the lower end of level 4 at age 11 did not achieve a Grade C in their GCSE English.

Therefore the ten steps to raise literacy standards includes the recommendation that the government considers whether the end of primary school target of Level 4 is sufficiently high to provide an adequate foundation for success at secondary school.

Schools should report to parents on their child’s reading age alongside information on national curriculum levels. From September, Ofsted will prioritise for inspection schools with the lowest achievement levels in literacy.

Ofsted will reinforce and further embed its present inspection practice of hearing children read. Schools’ assessment systems will be inspected to ensure that careful monitoring and effective intervention take place.

In colleges and work-based learning, Ofsted will give even greater emphasis to the inspection of literacy skills, as part of the inspection of programmes of study.

Ofsted will sharpen its focus on phonics in routine inspections of all initial teacher education provision – primary, secondary and further education. It is unlikely that any provider of primary initial teacher education will be judged outstanding unless the quality of its phonics training is also outstanding.

In addition to routine inspections, Ofsted will also start a series of unannounced inspections focused solely on the training of phonics teaching in providers of primary initial teacher education, which could trigger a full inspection.

Ofsted will publish a detailed survey of what works best in secondary schools to improve literacy across the curriculum.

Welcoming Ofsted’s English report at the literacy round table event today, the Director of the National Literacy Trust, Jonathan Douglas, said:

‘Addressing the barriers to raising literacy standards must be a top priority for schools, communities and employers. A focus on reading, writing, speaking and listening is essential across all subjects and we support the Chief Inspector in his call to renew a national drive for higher standards and greater engagement with parents.’

The report‘Moving English forward: Action to raise standards in English’, based on visits to over 250 schools, can be found online.

The Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted) regulates and inspects to achieve excellence in the care of children and young people, and in education and skills for learners of all ages. It regulates and inspects childcare and children’s social care, and inspects the Children and Family Court Advisory Support Service (Cafcass), schools, colleges, initial teacher training, work-based learning and skills training, adult and community learning, and education and training in prisons and other secure establishments. It assesses council children’s services, and inspects services for looked after children, safeguarding and child protection.

In recognition of the increasingly complex national security environment – including the threat from terrorism – the government is increasing funding for counter-terror police by £140 million next year, and for the UK intelligence community by £499 million, taking their funding to a record level.

With the proportion of young people in counter-terrorism casework increasing, the government will also bolster the tools available to tackle terrorist risk in these cases with the creation of new youth diversion orders.

Unlike existing counter-terrorism risk management tools, youth diversion orders will be specifically designed for young people to better manage cases which require intervention beyond Prevent. They will reduce the risk of further involvement with the criminal justice system – a key aim of the government’s Safer Streets Mission and the Plan for Change – by enabling the police to intervene earlier, working with partner agencies, before a young person’s activity risks escalating to the level at which a prosecution becomes necessary.

Youth diversion orders build upon a recommendation from the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, Jonathan Hall KC. The measures that are imposed will be subject to judicial oversight and will allow the police to impose both risk management and rehabilitative conditions, such as Prevent interventions or restrictions to online activity. Youth diversion orders will better enable the counter-terrorism system to divert young people involved in activity of terrorism concern online and in our communities.

Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, said:

National security is one of the government’s foundations and fundamental to our Plan for Change, which is why we are putting in record levels of funding to our security partners.

For some time now, law enforcement and intelligence agencies have been warning about the rapid increase in youth radicalisation, driven in large part by online activity. Today we are setting out new powers to tackle this and making major improvements to the Prevent programme to recognise the complex range of threats we face.

I am determined that we bring in the changes needed to move young people away from these dangerous ideologies and make the whole system more effective.

While Islamist terrorism remains the primary threat, followed by extreme right-wing terrorism, the overall threat picture is changing to include a growing cohort of young people radicalised online who do not align with any particular ideology and instead have fixations with violence. Recent Prevent statistics showed most referrals were for individuals with a vulnerability but no ideology or counter-terrorism risk.

To address this, the Home Secretary also outlined reforms to strengthen Prevent, the UK’s programme which diverts people away from radicalisation.

These will ensure that the programme keeps pace with the increasingly complex and evolving terrorist threat, stopping people from being drawn towards dangerous and extremist ideologies, carrying out acts of terrorism or supporting terrorism. The measures include:

A new permanent independent Prevent commissioner will also be recruited with the specific remit of reviewing the programme’s effectiveness, identifying gaps and problems before they emerge.

The independent commissioner will oversee the implementation of the new measures outlined by the Home Secretary.

Security Minister, Dan Jarvis said:

There has been a serious emerging trend of increased youth radicalisation across the country, with the proportion of MI5 investigations into under-18s surging threefold in the last 3 years.

Our first duty will always be to keep the public safe, and the measures we’ve set out today will help ensure the Prevent programme keeps pace with the threats we face and has the tools it needs to succeed.

The government will continue to take every possible step to counter dangerous ideologies and stop people from becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism.",Creation of new youth diversion orders and reforms to the Prevent programme,Legislative,Administrative,id25_508

Cutting-edge science projects to drive innovation, growth and create jobs in the UK’s high performing science sector, will benefit from a £300 million boost as part the government’s long term economic plan, Science Minister David Willetts will announce today (11 March 2014).

Ahead of a speech at Jodrell Bank Observatory, the home of radio astronomy, David Willetts said:

Investment in science is a crucial part of this government’s long-term economic plan. It’s about investing in our future, helping grow new industries and create more jobs – and that will mean more financial security for people across the country.

Speaking to an audience of scientists, apprentices and school children, the minister will confirm the following new investments:

These investments will see British scientists and businesses working together on some of the most exciting scientific projects of the future.

The UK is 1 of the most productive science nations in the world - with only 1% of the world’s population we publish 16% of the world’s top quality research.

And every £1 spent on research generates 50p for the wider economy every single year after.

Today’s (11 March 2014) announcements also build on the £270 million investment in quantum technologies announced by the Chancellor in his Autumn Statement last year (2013).

Quantum technologies create entirely new ways of communicating, measuring and processing information that are beyond the capability of existing systems. They already deliver satellite navigation, data storage and encryption – the industries of the future will be built on these capabilities and Britain will be at the forefront.

Paul Nurse, President of the Royal Society said:

International collaboration is central to scientific progress and is essential if we are to deliver projects on the scale of the Square Kilometre Array, the European Spallation Source and the M3 Space Mission.

Many scientific projects can only be pursued through such large scale collaboration and it is great that the government has decided that the UK will play its full part. Investment in these projects is also an investment in British innovation and in the creation of sustainable economic growth built on our world leading science.

British companies are already benefitting from the UK’s role as a global leader in science and innovation, and especially participation in the European Space Agency (ESA) Space Science programme. Astrium UK were awarded a contract in 2012 to lead the Solar Orbiter mission to study the Sun, and to build the spacecraft. UK participation in the nextESAspace mission will further increase the number of space sector jobs and bring wider economic benefits to the UK economy.

Innovative British firms, like Airbus, also have a real opportunity to play a role in providing the technological and manufacturing processes to meet demands of these cutting edge projects, directly generating economic growth and securing several hundred jobs.

UK science is quite literally reaching for the stars and opening up galaxies of opportunity for British firms by investing in these projects.

Professor Paul Hardaker, Chief Executive of the Institute of Physics, said:

We’re delighted to see this clear commitment to our international partners to invest alongside them in these world-leading scientific activities. The facilities being developed not only push forward our scientific understanding but will also deliver results that can have an impact on our everyday lives. It is involvement in these sorts of projects that will keep the UK at the forefront of global science.

President of the Royal Society of Chemistry, Professor Lesley Yellowlees said;

We welcome the investment in scientific infrastructure announced today (11 March 2014) by the government and the access to world class facilities and equipment this will give to researchers in the UK.

The global and UK economies and the well-being of nations and individuals are dependent on the chemical sciences. If we are to resolve global challenges - from developing and securing sustainable energy supplies to tackling antibiotic resistance and understanding and ameliorating climate change – then long-term investment in our world-leading scientific base is essential.

This is a welcome step in the right direction and we look forward to the forthcoming long-term strategy for science and innovation which the government will publish later this year (2014).

David Southwood, President of the Royal Astronomical Society said:

Everyone can appreciate the primary goal: PLATO is about establishing where our Earth and Sun sit in the scheme of the universe as a whole. The mission is not just a big step for space astronomers but what it sees will be used to exploit ground based telescopes as well. The whole astronomy community has something to gain.

An infographic highlighting how the UK punches above its weight in global science is available to view here-http://www.flickr.com/photos/bisgovuk/13059061204.

Subject to the completion of international negotiations, the UK will invest around £100 million in the Square Kilometre Array and around 10% to the construction costs of the European Spallation Source, about £165 million up to 2020 to 2021.

Science and innovation are proven to be key drivers of economic growth and jobs in the UK, with economists estimating that 70% of economic growth in the long term will come from innovation. It’s evident that firms who are innovative and persistently invest in research and development are more profitable, more likely to export and less likely to fail.

Government has protected the £4.6 billion science ring fenced budget and now have sustained capital investment in science guaranteed at £1.1 billion a year, year after year to 2020.

The government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries’. It set 4 ambitions in the‘Plan for Growth’, published at Budget 2011:

Work is underway across government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review.

Both our …",Department of Energy & Climate Change and The Rt Hon Chris Huhne,24 February 2011,"Denmark and the UK are in agreement that our future prosperity depends on stimulating green growth, and getting off the oil hook.

Both our countries are working on radical and transformative plans to decarbonise our energy supplies and support new green innovation. And we’re working together on initiatives such as the North Seas Offshore grid and the development of smart grid technology, while our businesses are driving forward ambitious offshore wind development.

The Danish ‘Energy Strategy 2050’ outlines an impressive long-term plan towards realising the Danish government’s goal of achieving independence from coal, oil and natural gas by 2050. Increasing energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy are key to delivering these results.

The UK’s Coalition Government has demonstrated the importance of taking ambitious action at home on low-carbon policies at the same time as setting out a long-term vision for transforming its economy.

Decarbonising further, faster, can keep Europe ahead in the global low carbon race, but the UK and Denmark can’t do that alone. That’s why the EU Commission’s forthcoming 2050 roadmap must kick-start the debate in Europe by offering a cost-effective, credible and ambitious pathway that enables member states to take the decisions that will stimulate low-carbon investment and take Europe beyond the cul-de-sac that’s the current 20% cut target.

      Six illustrative ‘2050 Pathways…",Department of Energy & Climate Change and The Rt Hon Chris Huhne,27 June 2010,"The UK’s energy and climate change policy was today recalibrated for the long term, supported for the first time by comprehensive analysis of plausible pathways to a secure, low carbon energy system in 2050.

In the first ever Annual Energy Statement to Parliament, Energy and Climate Change Secretary The Rt Hon Chris Huhne MP set out 32 actions being taken to accelerate the transformation of the energy system and wider economy.

Groundbreaking ‘2050’ analysis is published alongside, including six illustrative ‘pathways’ showing that meeting the target of an 80% cut in emissions by 2050 is ambitious but achievable, and compatible with maintaining security of energy supplies. A do-nothing ‘reference’ scenario highlights the risks of a high carbon future. An online ‘2050 Calculator’ also goes live today, enabling the public to explore the trade-offs inherent in designing the future secure, low carbon energy system and wider economy.

The Rt Hon Chris Huhne MP said:

“The coalition brings resolve and stability to energy and climate change policy. Today’s Annual Energy Statement sets out 32 important actions to introduce the transparency, certainty and long-termism needed to unlock investment.

“Our future energy system is too important to rely on crystal ball gazing. The 2050 Calculator provides the most comprehensive, long term analysis ever undertaken by Government. The decision to publish this material is a watershed in government’s honesty with the public about what’s needed in the long term. It will guide the decisions we make during this Parliament about the energy system we want in 40 years’ time.

“The challenge is ambitious but achievable. We’re already on track to cut the UK’s emissions by 34% by 2020, and will do more if we can win the case for greater ambition across the whole EU. But our line of sight needs to extend much further, through to the middle of the century.

“The era of cheap, abundant energy is over. We must find smart ways of making energy go further, and value it for the costly resource it is, not take it for granted. And even as we reduce overall demand for energy, we may need to meet a near doubling in demand for electricity, as we shift industry, transport and heating onto the grid.

“There are big choices and big trade offs in how we do this. The six pathways described today are only illustrative, but they highlight the scale and urgency of the task.

“Choosing the high carbon alternative would be high risk. It would lock in exposure to volatile oil prices, declining global reserves and rapidly increasing global energy demand. We’d risk having a dead end economy lagging behind those with the foresight to grab a share of growth in green industries.”

An annual statement to set strategic energy policy and guide investment was a commitment made in the coalition’s Programme for Government. The Rt Hon Chris Huhne MP’s oral statement in the Commons today is accompanied by a fullAnnual Energy Statementsetting out the programme and timetable for decisions - 32 actions in four key areas:

Announced/published today as part of the Annual Energy Statement:

A first session Bill will be published later in the year to legislate to put in place the legislative framework for the Green Deal and a number of other measures to improve the security of energy supplies, require further information on energy bills and ensure that access to offshore oil and gas infrastructure is available to all companies.

The ‘2050 Pathways Analysis’ is the Government’s first comprehensive, long-term look at the UK’s energy supply and demand sectors and greenhouse gas emissions to 2050. It shows some of the energy choices and trade-offs which we will all have to make over the next 40 years to ensure that we have secure low carbon energy supplies for the future.

The accompanying online ‘2050 Pathways Calculator’ allows people to explore the combinations of effort in each sector which combine to meet the UK’s emission reduction targets while also matching energy supply and demand. There are four levels capturing the range of futures for each sector and those can be combined to create hundreds of pathways that achieve our target to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050.

The analysis includes six pathways as illustrative examples of the possible pathways to 2050, plus one other pathway that shows what the world would look like if we choose a path reliant on heavy fossil fuel usage. These do not represent policy decisions and none of these is a preferred route.

These pathways differ but there are common conclusions:

The analysis is upfront about the potential costs - nobody has ever said that a move to a low carbon future would be cheap but our initial analysis suggests it can actually be less expensive than conventional energy generation under other mainstream fuel price scenarios and it may better protect us from fossil fuel price shocks.

The initial cost analysis only covers the cost implications of the illustrative pathways for the large scale power generation sector, as one of the areas where some of the biggest changes are required. The analysis is necessarily high-level, and it does not attempt to provide a full picture of the trade-offs between different pathways or of the costs in other sectors beyond the large scale generation sector.

The Government has worked with academics and members of the different industries to develop the figures and look at the potential for each sector. The publication of this work will enable a public debate about how the UK achieves its goals and ensure that all efforts add up to what is required. In the Call for Evidence the Department welcomes feedback on the assumptions, analysis and data used in this documentation.

Christine McGourty, Director of Energy UK,which represents the gas and electricity sector, said:

“This is a very interesting new way of examining the options ahead. Meeting the 2050 climate targets presents challenges for all sectors of the economy and the way we all lead our lives. The new Calculator could be very useful tool in allowing people to consider the different pathways ahead and contribute to the vital debate about how we develop a low-carbon economy , while keeping our energy supplies secure and affordable. “

Dr Simon Buckle, Climate Policy Director, Grantham Institute for Climate Change, Imperial College London, said:

“The Calculator is a very welcome initiative from DECC. The scale and complexity of the necessary low carbon transition makes charting a path to 2050 extremely challenging. The Calculator provides an accessible and valuable tool with which to begin to explore the main policy options and trade offs. While we also need to understand the costs and dynamics of the different potential pathways, I expect the Calculator to play an important role in informing and shaping the debate and decisions about our low-carbon future.”

Energy Technologies Institute Chief Executive Dr David Clarkesaid:

“The ETI welcomes the analysis in this 2050 Pathways Analysis report, which highlights some of the major challenges facing the UK in developing an affordable, secure, low carbon energy system that will help meet the UK’s legally binding targets for reducing greenhouse gases for 2020 and 2050.

“The scale of re-development highlighted in some of the DECC report scenarios, the Calculator, and in our own work, in supporting the UK’s economic growth, means substantial and sustainable development of UK supply chain capability and capacity is needed. We will play a key part in putting this in place.”

“The 2050 Pathways Analysis Report should help to inform and stimulate a wide ranging discussion about the assumptions and issues it covers. Engaging the public and industry in identifying the necessary solutions to meet the 2050 targets will become a key part of successfully delivering a low carbon economy for the UK.

“Our Energy System Model will help to build on this by highlighting the industry capability and economics of delivering affordable, low carbon energy system for the UK and we look forward to working with DECC to develop the Pathways further.

“The ETI thinks and acts strategically using a robust view of the whole UK energy system to make targeted investments in large scale engineering projects which reduce risk for the whole industry through the shared expertise and experience of our industrial members.

“The DECC report highlights that over the next 40 years there will be a need to increase electricity delivery in the UK whilst also supporting the long term goal of de-carbonising the energy system. Many of the technical issues identified in the scenarios align with the ETI’s technology programme, including how to create sustainable sources of bio energy, the challenges of developing more affordable large-scale carbon capture and storage facilities and establishing more cost effective offshore renewables.”",2050 Pathways Analysis & Online Calculator,Informational,,id25_512

“Yes, emissions were down in 2009 but so was the economy so this is no time for back slapping. A low-carbon approach has to be a vital part of kick starting and future proofing our economy, getting us off the oil hook and onto long-term green growth. That’s why we’re wasting no time in reforming the electricity market, setting up the Green Investment Bank, and legislating for the Green Deal.”

In 2009, UK emissions of the basket of six greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol were estimated to be 566.3 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e). This was 8.7% lower than the 2008 figure of 620.5 million tonnes. Between 2008 and 2009 there were decreases in emissions in all sectors, including 11.0% (24.2 MtCO2e) from the energy supply sector, 11.8% (11.5 MtCO2e) from the business sector, 36.5% (6.0 MtCO2e) from industrial processes, 4.2% (5.4 MtCO2e) from the transport sector, and 5.8% (4.8 MtCO2e) in the residential sector.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main greenhouse gas, accounting for about 84% of total UK greenhouse gas emissions in 2009. In 2009, UK net emissions of carbon dioxide were estimated to be 473.7 million tonnes (Mt). This was around 9.8% lower than the 2008 figure of 525.1 (Mt). There were decreases in emissions of 11.5% (24.1 Mt) from the energy supply sector, 13.1% (11.5 Mt) from the business sector, 4.2% (5.2 Mt) from the transport sector, and 5.9% (4.7 Mt) from the residential sector.

The overall decrease in emissions has primarily resulted from two factors: a significant fall in energy consumption across all sectors, and an increase in the use of nuclear power rather than coal and natural gas for electricity generation. As the UK economy contracted during 2009, this resulted in an overall reduction in demand for electricity, together with lower fossil fuel consumption by businesses and households.

All the sectoral breakdowns included in this statistical release are based on the source of the emissions, as opposed to where the end-user activity occurred. Emissions related to electricity generation are therefore attributed to power stations, the source of these emissions, rather than homes and businesses where electricity is used.

      Up to 100,000 insulation jobs by 2015  
    
  


Thousands of new insulation workers will…",Department of Energy & Climate Change and The Rt Hon Chris Huhne,2 November 2010,"Thousands of new insulation workers will soon be hitting Britain’s streets as part of a national effort to make people’s homes warmer and cheaper to run.

The Rt Hon Chris Huhne MP, Energy and Climate Change Secretary, today said that by 2015 up to 100,000 Green Deal workers could be employed in the effort to upgrade Britain’s homes. Currently around 27,000 work in the insulation industry. Legislation to start the process of establishing the Green Deal is due to be introduced into Parliament next month.

The Green Dealis the Government’s new and radical way of making energy efficiency available to all, whether people own or rent their property. The work to upgrade the property will be paid back from the saving on energy bills.

The Rt Hon Chris Huhne MP, visiting British Gas’ Energy Academy in Thatcham, said:

“The Green Deal’s about making people feel as warm as toast in their homes. I want Britain to say goodbye forever to leaky lofts and chilly draughts. At a time of increasing gas prices energy efficiency is a no-brainer.

“It’s also a massive economic and job opportunity which could help Britain’s economy turn the corner. With up to 100,000 green jobs up for grabs over the next 5 years, and even more in the long term, this is about growing our economy in a way that’s good for jobs, the environment and energy security.”

The Green Deal, which is expected to be available from autumn 2012, will be open to homes and businesses and will involve a 3-step process:

**Step 1 **- an independent energy survey of the property, giving clear advice on the best energy efficiency options, such as loft or cavity wall insulation.

**Step 2 **- Green Deal finance to be provided by a range of accredited providers, which will be repaid through savings on energy bills, making properties cheaper to run from day one.

**Step 3 **- Homes and businesses will then receive their energy efficiency package. Only accredited measures will be installed by appropriately-qualified installers, overseen by Government, giving consumers confidence that the deal they are getting is high-quality and will save them money.

The Government has today also announced measures to improve the energy efficiency of the private rented sector. With Green Deal, landlords will face no upfront costs when improving their properties. The forthcoming Energy Bill will create powers allowing any tenant asking for reasonable energy efficiency improvements to receive them from 2015 onwards. It will also allow local authorities, to insist that landlords improve the worst performing homes. Whether or not we use these powers will be subject to a review.

In September, British Gas announced its plans to “go early” on the Green Deal by investing £30 million in installing energy efficiency measures in its customers’ homes at no up-front cost. Repayments from customers will be made via savings in their energy bill.

To help deliver these energy efficiency services, British Gas plans to recruit a total of 3,700 “green-collar” jobs by the end of 2012. Today, British Gas announced that it has now filled 1,000 of these “green collar” roles across insulation, in-home advice, renewable generation and smart metering.

Phil Bentley, Managing Director of British Gas, said:

“With rising energy prices, there’s never been a better time to improve the energy efficiency of Britain’s homes. That’s why we’ve worked quickly to set up the British Gas Green Deal, a £30million investment in our customers’ homes. And today, we’re pleased to announce the recruitment of our thousandth green collar worker, who will help deliver the British Gas Green Deal. In total, we aim to have 3,700 green collar workers in place by 2012.”

In the build up to the Green Deal, 3.5 million more homes across Great Britain are likely to benefit from insulation by 2012 as part of changes to the obligation on energy suppliers announced in June. As part of the changes, 15% of homes helped will be the lowest income households more at risk of fuel poverty.

**Ian Cheshire, Group CEO Kingfisher plc and Chairman of B&Q, **said:“The Coalition Government’s flagship ‘Green Deal’ scheme offers great potential to revolutionise the home energy efficiency market. This will go a long way towards helping the UK to meet its ambitious climate change targets. We look forward to working together to help people save money and cut carbon in their homes.”

**National Insulation Association Chief Executive Neil Marshall, **said:“The Green Deal is an exciting new initiative which has a key role to play in significantly increasing the uptake of insulation, creating new jobs, whilst also reducing energy bills and tackling climate change. The NIA and its members look forward to continuing to work with Government in developing a robust delivery plan which will ensure a major increase in insulation volumes whilst maintaining the highest levels of quality and customer service.”

Stephen Radley, EEF’s Director of Policy and External Affairs, said:“The Government’s Green Deal promises to put money-saving energy efficiency measures within the financial reach of many small businesses for the first time. It also has the potential to open up a whole new market for energy efficient materials and equipment.”

Brian Berry, Director of External Affairs at the Federation of Master Builders (FMB),said:“The Government’s Green Deal to cut carbon in buildings has the potential not only to transform the existing building stock to make it more energy efficient but also to open up a new market worth at least £3.5 billion every year for construction SMEs. The challenge will be to ensure that small contractors have the opportunity to access the work as well as to demonstrate that they have the required skills to ensure public confidence in the scheme. The FMB as the largest trade association the building sector with 11,000 members across the UK is well placed to rise to the challenge and is now working with the Government to ensure the Green Deal is a success.”

The newCarbon Plansets out what has to happen and by when if the Government is to live up to its green ambitions, meet tough domestic carbon targets and encourage greater action internationally. It is focused on the jobs and economic opportunities of the low carbon economy and on policies that will help insulate Britain from future energy price shocks.

The Carbon Plan is published in draft today with the Government inviting the public and organisations to give their views on the contents. A final version will be published in the Autumn and then updated annually.

In a foreword to the document, the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and Energy and Climate Change Secretary The Rt Hon Chris Huhne MP write:

“This Carbon Plan sets out a vision of a changed Britain, powered by cleaner energy used more efficiently in our homes and businesses, with more secure energy supplies and more stable energy prices, and benefiting from the jobs and growth that a low carbon economy will bring.

But it does more than that. It shows exactly how we will deliver that vision and play our part in the global effort to tackle climate change and build a green economy through specific, practical action across government, month by month and department by department.’’

The draft Plan highlights three key changes that will be required across the UK economy, including:

Internationally, the plan sets out how the UK will work within the European Union and with other countries to promote ambitious action on climate change; support developing countries to limit emissions and adapt to climate change; and seek further progress towards a global climate change agreement.

The document details a range of deadlines and actions that a number of Government departments will have to meet. These include:

The entire public sector is working together to deliver the low carbon economy and local government in particular has a vital role to play in harnessing the enthusiasm that exists at the local level for tackling climate change.

To enable local councils the opportunity to take the lead in reducing emissions The Rt Hon Chris Huhne MP will be signing aMemorandum of Understandingwith the Vice-Chair of the Local Government Association, Richard Kemp this week, which will set out how DECC and the Local Government Group will work together to help and encourage all councils to take firm action to:

It is generally accepted, however, that the majority of football grounds are safer and more comfortable than they were twenty years ago. Before any change in the legislation, there would have to be a very clear demand, as well as very clear evidence that any such change meets stringent safety standards, presented from all the relevant authorities responsible for stadium safety, including the police, as well as it being clear that this is something all parties want.

In meetings with the football authorities and clubs, there is no appetite to change the current policy and no compelling case has been made. It is also worth noting that the Hillsborough Family Support Group state that “we are totally against any form of standing whatsoever. We are absolutely against it and always will be. Our football clubs should remain all-seater stadiums; we just believe there’s no such thing as safe standing in this country”.

We understand those that have to manage or licence/certify stadia generally hold the view that the introduction of all-seated stadia are better for public safety, and also have improved crowd management, crowd behaviour and policing. They provide higher standards of comfort to enjoy football matches and a defensible space for supporters, both of which help encourage inclusivity and diversity amongst those attending.

Whilst regulatory visits to sites that could cause serious environmental harm are continuing in the pandemic, in certain instances the organisation has carried out virtual inspections of permitted waste sites to check they are complying with regulations.

Using online services such as Zoom, checking CCTV video footage and requesting specific evidence to prove the sites are storing waste correctly, the Environment Agency has been successfully carrying out its inspections.

These remote ways of working have been used to carry out checks of permitted waste sites throughout the Midlands, including Tom White Waste, which has 3 permits for its two sites in Coventry.

David Hudson, Area Environment Manager for the Environment Agency, said:

We’ve been able to innovate and use technology to continue to regulate throughout this pandemic. Working remotely, we have received all of the necessary paperwork and photographs from Tom White Waste and carried out a meeting with them on Zoom, which included a site tour via their real time CCTV, to check their sites comply with the regulations of their permits. In this case we were satisfied the company has shown good practice and complied with the regulations.

Coronavirus is not an excuse to operate illegally. We are continuing to work closely with businesses and industry to help them meet their legal requirements and we are continuing to enforce regulatory requirements, while following the government’s guidance on social distancing.

We make clear in our approach to regulation and enforcement that we expect operators to take all reasonable steps to comply with regulatory requirements using contingency plans to help them comply.

Businesses and householders should carry out checks to ensure that they are using legitimate companies to deal with their waste. To check if a waste carrier is genuine visit the Environment Agency’spublic register.

The report will look at how much money is left abandoned in betting accounts and uncover the value of unclaimed winning tickets.

If the rightful owners of these winnings cannot be located, the cash could be put to good use, benefitting local communities through investing in sport.

“There is potential for some really good causes to benefit from this money - but we have to look at all the options first,” Mr Penrose said. “Every day thousands of people bet on the outcome of sporting events. Therefore it seems a natural fit that funds from abandoned betting accounts should be used to benefit grassroots sports projects.”

The review stems from a pledge in the Coalition Agreement to look into the best use of abandoned betting accounts.

Work will be done to determine how a betting account can be classed as ‘dormant’ and clarify any legal ramifications surrounding the use of the money. The potential legal rights of any claimants will need to be an important consideration. Customers will still be able to reclaim their money at any time, if they are able to prove their right to it.

Minister for Culture,Ed Vaizeysaid:

“It is wonderful that these treasures have been saved for the nation and this report highlights the important role of all those concerned in the export reviewing system. I am delighted that objects such as the great silver wine cistern of Thomas Wentworth and the Zodiac Settle by William Burges have been saved for UK collections, but I am of course disappointed that it has not been possible to save other important objects for the nation.

57th Annual Report of the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest.

The Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest is an independent body, administered by Arts Council England, which advises theSecretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sporton whether a cultural object, intended for export, is of national importance under specified criteria. Where the Committee finds that an object meets one or more of the criteria, it will normally recommend that the decision on the export licence application should be deferred for a specified period. An offer may then be made from within the United Kingdom at or above the recommended fair market price.

During the period of the Report i.e. 1 May 2010 - 30 April 2011 the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest was administered by the Museum, Libraries and Archives Council (“MLA”). On 1 October 2011 Arts Council England assumed responsibility for a number of the Cultural Property Functions previously carried out by the MLA including the administration of the Reviewing Committee.

Private Offers (“Ridley Rules”) - In May 1990 Mr Nicholas Ridley, the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, announced that in considering whether or not to grant an export licence for heritage items he proposed thenceforth to take account of an offer to buy the object during the deferral period from any source, whether public or private. In 1997 following consultation the policy was varied so that such private offers could only be taken into account by the Secretary of State if they were accompanied by undertakings guaranteeing reasonable public access, satisfactory conservation and security arrangements and retention of the object for a minimum period. This remains the policy today as set out inparas. 56 - 59 of Arts Council England’s Procedures and guidance for exporters of works of art 2011 Issue 1.

The Committee’s annual report was published today, together with the seventh annual report to Parliament by the Culture Secretary on the operation of the export controls on objects of cultural interest.  A copy of the report can be downloaded fromhttp://www.culture.gov.uk/.

The Minister’s ruling follows a recommendation by theReviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest, administered byArts Council England. The Committee recommended that the export decision be deferred on the grounds that the sculpture is of outstanding significance for the study of English sculpture in the 18th Century.

The white marble sculpture dates from 1702 and depicts the nude goddess Venus with her arms crossed, head turned to the right and half kneeling on a rectangular base. The figure is based on an antique prototype known as the Crouching Venus and may have been modelled on an antique work in the Royal Collection.  It is a rare surviving example of a classical subject in marble carved by the Netherlandish sculptor John Nost the Elder (d. 1710) working in England.

Lord Inglewood, Chairman of the Reviewing Committee, said: “This impressive and compelling figure of the goddess Venus is an important example of one of the earliest versions in England of an antiquity in marble, made for a British client.”

The decision on the export licence application for the sculpture will be deferred for a period ending on 3 January 2012 inclusive. This period may be extended until 3 May 2012 inclusive if a serious intention to raise funds with a view to making an offer to purchase the sculpture at the recommended price of £485,000 (plus VAT, amount to be confirmed, which can be reclaimed by most public institutions).

The Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest is an independent body, serviced by Arts Council England, which advises the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport on whether a cultural object, intended for export, is of national importance under specified criteria. Where the Committee finds that an object meets one or more of the criteria, it will normally recommend that the decision on the export licence application should be deferred for a specified period. An offer may then be made from within the United Kingdom at or above the recommended fair market price.

The details of the object are:

PROVENANCEProbably commissioned by Andrew Archer for Umberslade Hall in 1702First positively documented at Umberslade Hall in 1815 
Umberslade Hall was acquired by the Muntz family in 1856.Acquired by Thomas Coulborn & Sons from Robert Muntz Esq. in October 2007

The earliest existing documentation for the statue being at Umberslade Hall dates to 1815, when the Hall was described as “long-neglected”, and indeed had not been regularly occupied since 1778 so it is logical to suppose that the Venus must have been there some time before the death of the 2nd Lord Archer in 1778. While some internal decoration did take place in the time of Andrew Archer’s son Thomas (1st Lord Archer), who inherited in 1741, it is much more likely that the statue was commissioned by his father Andrew in 1702 as the house was constructed c. 1693-98.

The Minister’s ruling follows a recommendation by theReviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest, administered byArts Council England. The Committee recommended that the export decision be deferred on the grounds that the tables were of outstanding aesthetic importance and of outstanding significance for the study of 17th Century furniture and the history of taste and collecting in 19th Century Britain. The Committee awarded a starred rating to the tables meaning that every possible effort should be made to raise enough money to keep them in the country.

This pair of grand sculptural tables appears to have been made to celebrate the Venetian conquest of the Morea, or Greek Peloponnese, between 1685 and 1688. The pictorial marquetry tops are by Lucio de Lucci (fl. 1680-1700) and are made of different European and exotic hardwoods embellished with stained horn, ivory and pewter. The boxwood bases are attributed to the famous wood carver Andrea Brustolon (1662-1732), described by Balzac as the “Michelangelo of wood”. It is possible that they were made for the commander of the Venetian forces, Doge Francesco Morosini. They form part of a group of six tables by Lucio and Antonio de Lucci depicting events in the re-conquest of Eastern European territory from the Turkish Empire. This pair of tables is thought to have been acquired by the 5th Duke of Buccleuch during the 1830s and was sold by the 8th Duke in 1971.

Lord Inglewood, Chairman of the Reviewing Committee, said: “These magnificent tables are exceptional examples of 17th Century Italian baroque furniture, something that is under-represented in this country. They are undoubtedly of great interest to the history of taste and collecting in 19th Century Britain.”

The decision on the export licence application for the tables will be deferred for a period ending on 3 January 2012 inclusive. This period may be extended until 3 May 2012 inclusive if a serious intention to raise funds with a view to making an offer to purchase the tables at the recommended price of £735,900 (inclusive of VAT) is expressed.

Addressing more than 100 hoteliers, businesses and tourism bodies from across Cornwall, the Culture Secretary said that the region was one of the most stunning parts of the country, and that there were big wins to be had in 2012 for Cornwall - in particular its tourism industry.

Mr Hunt also revealed that the region would feature in major international and national marketing campaigns to promote UK tourism in 2012, and urged local tourism firms to sign up to a new 20.12 per cent discount scheme.

The event, which was hosted by Suzanne Bond, Chief Executive of theCornwall Development Company, showcased the business, tourism, cultural and sporting opportunities that the Games bring.

Other speakers includedJohn Penrose(Tourism Minister), Bill Morris (Director of Ceremonies at London 2012), David Fursdon (South West member of the London 2012 Nations and Regions group) and Lady Cobham (VisitEngland’s Chairman).

Jeremy Hunt said:

“Last year, 4.3 million visitors came to Cornwall, bringing £1 billion into the local economy. Next year, with the Games and our biggest-ever tourism marketing campaign we can do even better.  With the Torch Relay passing right through the area - including taking a balloon flight at the Eden Project - we have a once-in-a-generation chance to show the world the very best of Cornwall and the South West. From the atmospheric countryside of Bodmin Moor, to cultural and historic sites like St Michael’s Mount and Cornwall’s mines, and Michelin-starred restaurants like Driftwood and Restaurant Nathan Outlaw, Cornwall and the South West have it all- and we need to make sure the whole world knows.”

VisitEngland’s Chairman Lady Cobham said:

“I’m delighted to be here in Cornwall with the Secretary of State, Jeremy Hunt, and Tourism Minister, John Penrose. This exciting tourism roadshow launches England’s most high profile campaign to boost domestic tourism, and is designed to highlight the fantastic experiences Britons can enjoy literally on their doorsteps. 2012 offers the tourism industry a number of unprecedented opportunities.  Not only will England be showcased to billions of people all over the world, but we have the opportunity to grow domestic tourism by inspiring Britons to rediscover England and take a holiday at home next year. Spear-heading the promotion will be a high profile TV campaign and specially devised discounted offers. Our job as the national tourist board is to work with the industry to harness the pride we know is felt by local residents and to inspire them to act as ambassadors for their destinations for next year and beyond.”

Suzanne Bond, Chief Executive of the Cornwall Development Company said:

“We are delighted to welcome the Culture Secretary and Tourism Minister to Cornwall during their nationwide tour.  Their visit follows Cornwall’s recent successes in the 2011 British Travel Awards, where it not only won three top awards but is now confirmed as the top UK holiday destination for the third year running.  The 2012 Games provide the opportunity for Cornwall to attract new visitors to the county from traditional and emerging markets.  These visitors will have a first class experience of Cornwall’s outstanding tourism offer as well as witnessing first hand the pioneering and transformational changes across the county.”

Maria Miller said:

“The memorial to the heroes of Bomber Command in London’s Green Park is a solemn and beautiful tribute to the bravery of those who flew, and made the ultimate sacrifice, for us all during World War II.

“It is absolutely right that public funding be made available for this, and that we move decisively now to do so.  I am extremely grateful to John Caudwell in his efforts to bring this matter to closure, and to all those people whose generosity in making donations, large and small, have helped us to get to this point. Those surviving veterans from that campaign can rest easy tonight knowing that their fund-raising efforts are complete, and that they will not have to dip into their own pockets to make up the shortfall.”

John Caudwell said:

“I am delighted the government has chosen to recognise the importance of the need to relieve veterans and trustees of the Bomber Command Association of the worry associated with knowing there was a cash shortfall, and a very real danger of financial ruin for the trustees.

“In truth, this did drag on too long, and perhaps the least the government could do for the families, friends and colleagues of the 55,573 airmen from Bomber Command who gave their lives to give us the freedom we have today, was to make a further contribution in recognition of their sacrifice.”

The DCMS announced a grant of £796,000 towards the creation of a permanent memorial to honour the 55,573 men of Bomber Command who lost their lives in World War II in February this year.  A grant of £204,000 was also given to the project under the Government’s Memorials Grant Scheme, bringing total DCMS support for the project before today to £1 million.

The RAF Bomber Command Association (BCA) and the Heritage Foundation have campaigned since 2008 for a memorial to commemorate the 55,573 men of the RAF Bomber Command that lost their lives in World War II.Planning consent was granted by Westminster City Council in May 2010 to allow the memorial to be built in Green Park.  BCA opened the memorial in June 2012.The memorial has been funded mainly through donations from veterans and their families.  The total cost of the memorial is believed to be between £5m and £7m.

John Caudwell is an entrepreneur and philanthropist. John sold his mobile telecoms business, which included high street chain Phones 4u, in 2006, for £1.5 billion. He has since focused on philanthropic work, supporting causes as varied as the Bomber Command Memorial, the Prince’s Regeneration Trust, the Elton John AIDS Foundation, and the charity he founded, Caudwell Children, which assists children with severe, terminal or life-threatening conditions and illnesses.

‘Real aid’ is helping countries to beat poverty for good, say the charity, by gradually reducing reliance on foreign help and building up their own capabilities.

The new report finds that poor countries’ reliance on aid has declined by a third over the past decade and the UK is taking a global lead through high quality aid.

In the report,Real Aid 3: Ending Aid Dependency, the charity argues that effective aid helps countries to set their own development path. For example, by building up systems like tax collection, real aid helps countries to generate their own funds for development.

With the help of real aid, reliance on foreign help dropped from 47% to 27% in Ghana in the last ten years. In Mozambique dependency fell from 74% to 58%.

ActionAid’s Head of Economic & Social Development, Dr Anna Thomas said:

Our research shows that more developing countries are becoming less dependent on aid and are able to rely increasingly on their own resources to deliver essential services.

These results show we’re moving in the right direction - and means that good quality aid - real aid - is working.“Real aid is effective and has few strings attached. It puts developing countries where they should be - in the driving seat of their own development.”

The report echoes the direction of UK aid that was set out in the Department for International Development’s aid reviews earlier this year. In its new approach paper -UK aid: Changing lives, delivering results- the agency aims to help more countries to graduate from aid, reaching the point where they no longer require support and can meet the needs of their own people with their own resources.","UK aid: Changing lives, delivering results",Welfare,Other,id25_540

These are the key themes set to be discussed at the next meet up of the UN’sHigh Level Panel on the Post 2015 Development Agenda, later this month.

The public’s suggestions will be fed in directly to discussions at the panel’s meeting, which is due to take place in London from 31 October - 2 November.

The High Level Panel was set up to helpexplore the best way to fight poverty across the globe after 2015- the target date for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

The panel - set up by the head of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon - is co-chaired by Britain’sPrime Minister David Cameron, Indonesia’s President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Liberia’sPresident Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.

The Prime Minister appointedMichael Andersonas his Special Envoy on the Development Goals.

Mr Anderson said:

The panel is in listening mode. Panel members want to hear from people and organisations around the world - to hear their experiences, to understand their challenges, and to share their priorities.

It is only by working together in this way that we can, as a global community, agree to a development agenda that will drive poverty eradication and meet new challenges once theMDGsexpire.

Staff will then complete the home test in the normal way, before reporting their results to the NHS using the provided gov.uk address.

The workplace testing programme uses lateral flow tests (LFD) to rapidly detect the virus in 30 minutes. Swift detection of cases means those who test positive can isolate immediately and, in doing so, break chains of transmission and suppress the virus.

Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said:

Rapid testing is a vital part of our roadmap, helping us to cautiously lift restrictions on our economy and society.

Around one in three people with coronavirus do not have any symptoms, so extending employee testing from the workplace to the home will help us identify more cases we otherwise wouldn’t find, prevent further transmission and save lives.

60,000 businesses across the country have already registered for free, regular and rapid tests and I encourage many more to take up the offer, helping to keep their employees and their families safe.

Businesses are encouraged to register before 12 April in order to access free tests until the end of June, even if they’re not yet open or are not able to start using the tests straight away.

As well as reporting their result directly to the NHS, employees should advise their employer of a positive result and take a confirmatory PCR test. Employers will retain an important role in encouraging their employees to take and report the results of their test.

Matthew Fell, CBI Chief UK Policy Director, said:

Mass, rapid workplace testing is an essential pillar of the roadmap for reopening, alongside the vaccine rollout. Having the option for staff to test at home will enable more firms to embrace workplace testing, as not all employers will have the space or facilities to run testing programmes on their premises.
The move to home testing reflects ongoing, high quality dialogue between business and government. We’d encourage as many firms as possible to register before the 12 April deadline, as part of their broader efforts to keep staff and customers safe.

Employers with fewer than 10 people can alternatively access regular testing through the community testing programme, which is now offered by all local authorities in England. Work is also underway to allow staff of small businesses to order tests online to be sent to their home.

Helen Dickinson, Chief Executive of the British Retail Consortium said:

The BRC welcomes the proposal to extend the workplace testing programme to include home testing. This is something we have called for as the next step for smaller businesses and stores where the space for testing at work is limited. It is also supported by employees as a practical approach.

Testing will form a crucial part of everyday life as parts of society reopen. Regular testing could be the difference between a workplace being able to stay open and operational, or needing to close due to a Covid-19 outbreak. For many employers on-site testing has already become an essential part of its employee offer and a routine part of working life.

Around 1 in 3 people with coronavirus don’t have symptoms, which means they could be spreading the virus in workplaces without knowing.

Regular, rapid testing is already in place for millions of people across the NHS, care homes and schools. The government has also confirmed twice-weekly home testing using lateral flow tests for free to all adults in households with primary, secondary school and college aged children and young people, including childcare and support bubbles.

This is in addition to the two home tests for all secondary and college students and staff per week. Staff in primary schools, and in private, voluntary and independent nurseries also have access to rapid testing through their workplace.

The announcement comes as a new set of statistics published on Friday, by the Official of National Statistics (ONS), revealed 86% of people testing positive for coronavirus are fully complying with self-isolation guidance for their full isolation period.

Data also showed 90% of the contacts reached by NHS Test and Trace are fully adhering with the rules and that 97% of NHS COVID-19 app users started to self-isolate within 24 hours of receiving a notification. The majority of respondents (68%) also fully understood the self-isolation guidance. Of people who did not fully comply, the most common breaches were to buy food, get medicines or medical appointments.

BT Chief Medical Officer, Dr Richard Caddis said:

BT is pleased to have been supporting this important government trial in England, offering rapid home testing to our field engineers who have done such an incredible job of keeping the country connected.

Eastwood Park CEO John Thatcher said:

We originally invested in testing kits for all staff and the hundreds of learners returning to our classroom and laboratory-based training. Now to benefit from support from the government providing kits for staff, which on average could mean 120 tests per week, is allowing us to focus on our learners. The additional security and ease presented by the new self-testing operation, sitting alongside all the other day to day measures, has been a big confidence boost for everyone.",Workplace testing programme (including home testing),Administrative,,id25_543

“Bill and Melinda Gates have proved an inspirational and unstoppable force in the fight against global disease and destitution. Today is the beginning of a close and productive relationship between their Foundation and our government. I am looking forward to working closely with Bill in the run up to this crucial summit. We agree that this would be the worst possible moment for the international community to retreat from our promise to help developing nations. The global economy has undergone a major trauma and the world’s poorest are being hit extremely hard.

“The New York talks are a huge opportunity to get the Millennium Development Goals back on track. With the 2015 deadline now around the corner, the time for warm words is over. National leaders have a duty to put in place a concrete plan to bring down the high death tolls of mothers, children and babies that are a blight on developing nations.

“The Coalition Government and Gates Foundation are committed to working together to eradicate polio, which is 99% eradicated but on which we need a big push to eradicate the final 1%. I can today confirm that the UK will provide the next phase of its support, vaccinating 15-20m children under 5 this year”.Mr Gates said:

“It was a pleasure to meet with Nick Clegg today. I appreciate the opportunity to gain a better understanding of the new government’s strategy on international development assistance, especially as the world prepares for the MDG Review Summit at the UN General Assembly in September.  I welcome the UK’s leadership on international development and its commitment to maintaining the nation’s promise to spend 0.7% of its Gross National Income on official development assistance, despite significant challenges to the British economy. I urge other donor nations, particularly those in the G8, to follow its lead.

“In the face of such challenging economic times, we must be even smarter about how resources are used and maintain our commitments to the world’s poor. I commend the Deputy Prime Minister and the new government’s determination to ensure that the resources of the Department for International Development are spent on programmes that focus on solutions and deliver positive results, like their work on the global elimination of polio.

“The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation, of which the UK and the Gates Foundation are the largest funders, is a good example of smart investing and effective partnerships. The GAVI Alliance funds vaccine programmes in 72 countries - providing one of the most cost effective innovations in global health.  Because of GAVI and other international organisations dedicated to improving the lives of children, we’ve seen a reduction in worldwide mortality in children under the age of five from 11.9 million deaths in 1990 to 7.7 million deaths in 2010. I look forward to working with the UK on these and the many other challenges facing us as we work to help give all people the opportunity to live healthy and productive lives.”",Providing support for vaccinating 15-20m children under 5,Welfare,Other,id25_544

The project will support the self-reliance agenda of the Afghan Government, through increasing levels of domestic tax revenue to help finance the delivery of basic services.

The Tax Administration Project (TAP) is a project administered by the Ministry of Finance’s Afghanistan Revenue Department. It ensures the Afghanistan Revenue Department is a modern, efficient and customer-focused revenue collection agency, and will further improve revenue collection.

The Secretary of State for International Development, Justine Greening said:

I am very pleased to be alongside Minister Zakhilwal to reaffirm the UK Government’s long term commitment to Afghanistan. At the Tokyo Development Conference we pledged to maintain our current development assistance of £178 million a year until at least 2017 in July.

Afghanistan has made significant progress over the last decade but there is still more to do. That’s why today we are extending our existing support to the Afghanistan Revenue Department -it’s already a successful partnership with the Ministry of Finance that’s seen tax rewards soar eight times from $250m in 2004 to $2 billion in 2012 so it makes sense to go ahead with this next phase.

This UK support will help the Afghan Government deliver one of the key areas of the five Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework commitments.

The Afghan Minister for Finance, Omar Zakhilwal said:

I would avail this opportunity to thank the United Kingdom, the fourth largest bilateral donor to Afghanistan, for its generous support over the past years. Our achievements on public finance management and especially revenue collection has been remarkable. We count on support from the UK and other partners in furthering reforms and striding towards reaching higher levels of fiscal sustainability.

Justine Greening was in Afghanistan for the first time to see for herself the significant progress that has been made over the past decade. During her visit she met with senior members of the Afghan Government including President Karzai. She travelled to Helmand and visited a UK funded health centre which has helped thousands of Helmandis access basic health services.

Since thePremier League 4 Sport(PL4S) programme began in 2009, it has provided more than 39,000 youngsters across the country with an opportunity to try badminton, judo, table tennis and volleyball. An additional £2 million of funding from the Premier League will double the number of Olympic sports with basketball, handball, hockey and netball now on offer.

“Football can be incredibly powerful in engaging young people,” Mr Hunt said. ”ThePL4Sscheme has already involved tens of thousands of young people and has given a huge boost to grassroots sport. The extra funding announced today by the Premier League means that the project will be able to offer even more sports. Initiatives like this will do a huge amount to help deliver the Government’s plans to encourage young people to develop a sporting habit for life.”

Premier Leaguechief executive Richard Scudamore said: “Our clubs bring unique qualities to a project like Premier League 4 Sport - and not just the power of the club badge to attract young people’s involvement. The dedication of the clubs and their staff to this project has ensured thatPL4Shas gone way past the targets first set in 2009. Delivering on the promises of London 2012 is not necessarily the job of the Premier League, but we say why not? We have the ability to do it and it is a yet another opportunity to work in partnership with Government and make a positive contribution.”

PL4Sis a joint venture between the Premier League,Sport Englandand theYouth Sport Trust. It was funded by a £3.8 million investment through thePremier League Creating Chancesprogramme in partnership with the Department of Culture, Media and Sport. The initiative has provided a blueprint for the idea of creating community sport clubs on secondary school sites.

The high level endorsement coincides with the IOC’s three-day inspection visit and the publication of the Government’s new legacy blueprint, “Beyond 2012” - which sets out for the first time the breadth and depth of the sporting, economic, regeneration and community legacy that will be delivered after the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

President Rogge will meet the Prime Minister in Downing Street to hear where London’s preparations are, and how the Government is helping to deliver not just a great Games, but also a real and lasting legacy. He will also be introduced to the new officialSainsbury’s School GamesAmbassadors: Olympians Denise Lewis, Darren Campbell and Jason Gardener, and Paralympian Ellie Simmonds.

David Cameron said:

“Legacy has been built into the DNA of London 2012. But by definition, of course, the true legacy of London 2012 lies in the future. Though much has been done, I am acutely aware that the drive to embed and secure the benefits of London 2012 is still to come. That is our biggest challenge. It’s also our greatest opportunity.”Jacques Rogge said:

“London has raised the bar on how to deliver a lasting legacy.  We can already see tangible results in the remarkable regeneration of East London.  This great historical city has created a legacy blueprint for future Games hosts.”

Seb Coe said:

“London 2012 will be a summer of sport and celebration like no other. But it will only be the start of the journey. My dream is that millions of young people, here and overseas, will witness the achievements of the finest sportspeople on the planet and be inspired to take up sport for themselves.”

Andrew Altman, Chief Executive of theOlympic Park Legacy Company, said:

“Legacy plans are more advanced than any previous Olympic host city. We are on track to build a new piece of the city in East London and over the next 20 years deliver an exciting mix of new homes, jobs and training, along with sporting, cultural and entertainment opportunities.  London has set the benchmark for using the Games as a catalyst for regeneration.”

There is no complacency amongst Games organisers, and there remains a huge amount to deliver before 27 July.  But, as the IOC President Rogge makes clear, the UK is setting the international legacy standard for all other bidding cities. The key aspects of London’s legacy - as set out in today’s new document - are:

After his meeting with Jacques Rogge, the Prime Minister will be joined by Her Royal Highness the Princess Royal and will host a reception in Downing Street for young people involved in the new School Games, as the Youth Sport Trust announce the athletes who will champion the competition as ‘School Games Ambassadors’.

Speaking about the School Games, Olympic heptathlon champion, Denise Lewis, said:

“I believe the Sainsbury’s School Games will provide the young competitors with a fantastic opportunity to taste what it is like to compete at the highest level at a multi-sport event.  Competing in some of the Olympic venues before London 2012 is something most young people can only dream of.”

Olympic gold medallist Darren Campbell added:

“At any major sporting event there will be a whole range of experiences that can both boost your performance, but also distract you from performing at your best. The Sainsbury’s School Games gives these young people a chance to understand the pressures and expectations of elite sport which can only benefit them in the future.”

Backed by National Lottery funding fromSport England, the School Games is a multi-sport event for school-aged elite athletes. The finals will take place from 6-9 May 2012. Around 1,600 young people will compete across 12 sports, six of which include disability competition.

The three bronze Edgar Degas sculptures have been temporarily allocated toThe Courtauld Gallery.

Corot was a leading French painter of the mid-19th century who influenced future generations of painters, particularly the Impressionists.

His portraits were for his own private pleasure, and were never exhibited by the artist during his lifetime. TheL’Italienne paintingdates from the last years of Corot’s life and is a fantastic example of Corot’s later works, where he often painted peasant figures, drawing upon the heroism of mythological paintings.

Edgar Degas was one of the greatest artists of the late 19th century, as versatile and inventive with paint and chalks as he was with sculpture. The three sculptures accepted in lieu from the Freud estate were cast from wax models that Degas prepared for his own private pleasure. Only one sculpture was ever exhibited in Degas’ lifetime.

The move is a key part of a £1 billion, five-year youth and community sport strategy published today that will deliver on Lord Coe’s 2012 Games bid promise to inspire a generation to get involved in sport.

The strategy, to be delivered bySport England, will see new school-based sports clubs established with links to one or more sports’ national governing bodies. Expert coaches will run sessions to help create strong ties between schools and local sports clubs already in existence in their area. Football has pledged that 2,000 of their clubs will be linked to secondary schools by 2017, rugby union 1,300 clubs, cricket, 1,250 clubs and rugby league and tennis 1,000 clubs each.

Also, for the first time, funding will be made available to open up school sport facilities for wider public use.  Three-quarters of sports halls and artificial pitches and a third of swimming pools in England are located on school sites and £10 million of funding will enable communities to make the most of these local sporting assets.

£100 million will be invested in creating the clubs and tackling the drop-off in sports participation that can happen when young people leave school. Of this, £50 million will be invested to boost sport provision at further education colleges and universities.

The funding will also provide a full-time sports professional for at least 150 further education colleges, to drive forward innovative sports provision.

Around £450 million will go to sports governing bodies between 2013 and 2017 for their ‘whole sport plans.’ Around 60 per cent will benefit young people aged 14 - 25 so that sports are completely focussed on helping to drive a sporting habit for life. The remaining 40 per cent will be aimed at the rest of the population. Funding to governing bodies will be on a payments-by-results basis with sports that fail to deliver putting their public funding at risk.

Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and SportJeremy Huntsaid:

Despite huge investment of public funds since we won the right to host the Games, participation by young people in sport has been falling. We need a radical change in policy to address the deep-seated problem of people dropping out of sport when they leave school. Our bold approach will see money going to organisations that deliver on youth participation, but also withdrawn quickly from those which fail to meet agreed objectives.

Sport EnglandChief Executive Jennie Price said:

Changing the sporting behaviour of a generation is a major challenge, which has not been achieved by any other Olympic host nation. With a new focus on young people and an even tougher, Government backed, regime of payment by results, Sport England and its partners are determined to deliver.

Alex Horne, General Secretary of theFA, said:

Football welcomes the Sport England strategy and the increased focus on youth participation. A priority will be taking 2,000 local football clubs into secondary schools across the country, offering expert coaching and creating the strong ties that will help young people make the move from school sport to community sport.

Ian Drake, Chief Executive ofBritish Cycling, said:

Looking ahead to the next funding cycle, we have ambitious plans to build further on the success we’ve achieved over the past few years, and to capitalise on the inspirational impact of London 2012 to increase participation. We look forward to continuing to work closely with Sport England on turning these plans into reality under the new strategy outlined today. We take our responsibilities seriously in terms of maximising the impact of the public money we receive. We fully appreciate the fact this funding is a privilege and not a right, and with that in mind it makes sense to tie-in continued funding to the achievement of agreed goals and objectives to help ensure the best return on investment across all sports.

David Collier, Chief Executive of theECB, said:

The ECB welcomes the new Sport England strategy and the reach down to 14 year olds.
This very much mirrors crickets own strategy to get more young people playing at school and in clubs and keep them involved in the game throughout their lives.”

Paul Clark, Chief Executive ofEngland Netball, said:

The success we’ve had in growing adult netball participation through our Back2Netball programme has clearly demonstrated that the participant-focused approach we take at England Netball is the right one. Our key challenge over the next four years will be to apply that approach and learning to drive increased participation in netball amongst young people aged between 14 and 25 years of age. This age group is critical to our ambition of encouraging and enabling engagement in Netball for Life.

There is also an additional £160 million to improve the nation’s sports facility stock between 2012 and 2017, building on Sport England’s existing £90 million ‘Places, People, Play’ legacy facilities investment, while a new £40 million local sport fund will also be set up to help local authorities improve sport provision.

TheYouth Sport strategywill build on the success of, and complement, the £150 million ‘School Games’ that is rejuvenating competitive sport for young people with over 11,000 schools signed up.

We want to see bids that are distinctive, ambitious, and represent their local area. As well as demonstrating cultural excellence, the panel and I want to see partnerships with innovation that will engage a huge range of audiences.

Hosted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the meeting at Lambeth Palace on Friday (16 July 2010) was an opportunity for the leaders of the main faiths to discuss with government ministers the role of faith groups in helping to strengthen communities.

Mr Pickles said:

“We see the Big Society as a very practical way to put people in control of the decisions that affect them and to encourage everyone to take an active part in civic life.

“For years, faith communities have been quietly making a huge difference day-in and day-out, to every single neighbourhood in the country - something that has not been sufficiently recognised by central Government. Today has been an opportunity to do so and to explore how, in realising our ambitions for a Big Society, we can together build on the huge amount of experience faith groups have in getting out into the community.

“Some see religion as a problem that needs to be solved. The new government sees it as part of the solution. I want to send an important signal that we value the role of religion and faith in public life. The days of the state trying to suppress Christianity and other faiths are over.”

Dr Clark commented:

“Faith communities make a vital contribution to national life: guiding the moral outlook of many, inspiring great numbers of people to public service, providing support to those in need. A ‘community of communities’, they often have the experience, volunteers and connections that can put them at the heart of their neighbourhood.

“Everyone has a part to play in building the Big Society. The government’s job is to make sure that religious groups and other grass roots organisations have the space in which to get on with their good work, unhindered by the barriers many of them currently negotiate.”

Today, the Prime Minister has fleshed out plans for developing the Big Society with the announcement of a Big Society Bank along with 4 areas - Liverpool, Sutton, Windsor and Maidenhead and the Eden Valley in Cumbria - who will lead the way in building the Big Society.

Game developers and publishers from around the world gathered for the annualBritish Academy Video Games Awardson Wednesday and it was a night to remember for some of Britain’s foremost developers.

Codemasters Birmingham won the Sports BAFTA for the game F1 2010, an ultra-realistic simulation of the 2010 Formula One world championship. The Multiplayer award went to another racing game, Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, developed byCriterion, the Guildford-based creators of the hit Burnout series. And Leicestershire-basedRaretook home the Family BAFTA for Kinect Sports, which uses a new technology to allow players to play “controller-free”.

In one of the highlights of the evening,Sir Ben Kingsley presented the Academy’s highest honour, the Fellowship, to Peter Molyneux OBE. The Surrey-born game designer is one of the best-known names in the industry and the creative force behind major titles such as Populous, Dungeon Keeper and the Fable series. Cumulative sales of his games are at approximately fifteen million worldwide.

“I remember back in 1967 watching the first BAFTA awards on television with my family and seeing them being so excited about those accolades,” Mr Molyneux said. “Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think it would be possible for me to accept one of the greatest honours the entertainment industry has to offer. My first thought on learning that I was awarded an Academy Fellowship was that to be in the company of some of the greatest talents the entertainment industry has ever seen is truly humbling and secondly that this is an award not just for myself, but for all the people I’ve ever worked with.”

British talent was also represented in this year’s BAFTA Ones to Watch Award, which went to That Game Studio, for Twang!, created as part of the University of Abertay Dundee’sDare to be Digital programme. The team behind the game included one of Abertay’s own graduates, 23-year-old Brit Thomas Finlay.

The ceremony marked another successful year for the British game development industry, which is responsible for globally-successful titles such as Grand Theft Auto, the Tomb Raider series and one of 2010’s BAFTA winners, Little Big Planet.

The funding package, which mixes private philanthropy, lottery cash and commercial funding, has been supported by today’s Government announcement about English Heritage reserves and road improvements.

Speaking at Stonehenge today, John Penrose said: “This is fantastic news for everyone involved in the project. It is a real step forward in making sure thisWorld Heritage Site- a unique and iconic symbol of our prehistoric past - is not simply preserved, but also presented in the best possible light for visitors in the future. Stonehenge is also an important draw for tourists from all over the world. But for too long the way it has been presented to visitors has been woefully inadequate - decades of dithering and indecision have got us nowhere. So it’s only right - and long overdue - that new thinking and cooperation between parties come together to ensure the whole visitor experience is world-class too.

“It was bitterly disappointing when the country’s dire financial state meant we had to withdraw government funding for the visitor centre here last June. But I - along with English Heritage and my colleagues across government - have been committed to finding other ways to support the project. The fact that we have now almost secured private funding is an example of the Big Society in action, with everyone working together to ensure a mix of funding solutions.

“The plans announced today mean that a successful outcome for this project is now a lot closer. There may still be a bit further to go, but we are optimistic English Heritage will be successful in securing the remaining funding that is required.”

Mike Penning added: “I fully recognise the importance of preserving this iconic heritage site and am delighted to help the Stonehenge improvements take an important step forward.

“I have agreed around £3.5 million funding to allow the Highways Agency to close the junction of the A303/A344 - improving the setting of one of the world’s most popular ancient monuments and aiding its conservation. This is subject to successful completion of statutory processes to remove traffic from the Wiltshire Council controlled A344.

“The funding would also allow the HA to increase capacity on the A360/A303 at Longbarrow Crossroads which will help ease congestion around Stonehenge, including for those travelling to the new visitors’ centre.”

Dr Simon Thurley, Chief Executive of English Heritage said:

“These are crucial steps which bring closer the transformation of the currently blighted Stonehenge landscape.

This is the second round of funding for ultra-fast broadband, with 10 of our largest cities already working on detailed plans to upgrade their networks.

The Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport Jeremy Hunt said:

This is a fantastic opportunity for 27 cities across the country to demonstrate how they’d revolutionise the way their residents and businesses get online.

These ultrafast speeds will allow more cities in the UK to compete with the fastest in the world, bringing new opportunities for growth, the development of high tech industries and the transformation of public services.

To be able to bid for the fund cities must have a Royal Charter and more than 45,000 homes and businesses, or more than 35,000 homes and businesses in Northern Ireland.

The eligible cities are Aberdeen, Brighton & Hove, Cambridge, Chelmsford, Coventry, Derby, Dundee, Exeter, Gloucester, Kingston upon Hull, Leicester, Londonderry / Derry, Newport, Norwich, Oxford, Perth, Peterborough, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Preston, Salford, Southampton, Stoke-on-Trent, Sunderland, Swansea, Wolverhampton and York.

Bidding cities will need to produce plans for how they will use their share of the £50 million and detailed bidding guidance will be published by 18 May.

Projects will have to include the creation of a contiguous area offering fixed ultrafast broadband of at least 80-100Mbps broadband as well as high speed wireless connectivity.

The fund can only be used to support the roll-out of ultrafast broadband to areas that will not be served by the private sector.

The resources the city proposes to bring to the project - either in funding or other contributions - will be a factor in assessing the bids and there will be a presumption in favour of match funding.

The winning cities will be announced in the Autumn Statement later this year.

The first round of applications for super-connected status saw the four national capitals and six other cities selected.

Ofwat will be taking forward a consultation to define the criteria for a ban. That could include successful prosecution for a Category 1 or 2 pollution incident – such as causing significant pollution at a bathing site or conservation area – or where a company has been found guilty of serious management failings.

The ban would apply to all executive board members and Chief Executives and would be expected to come into effect later this year, subject to consultation. If taken forward, Ofwat would implement the measures by changing the conditions of water company licences. For water companies in England this would be done using the powers given to the regulator through the Environment Act 2021.

Last year 10 water bosses received bonuses, totalling £2.5 million.

The measures form part of the government’s long-term strategy to tackle pollution, clean up British waters and ensure a plentiful supply for the future.

No-one should profit from illegal behaviour and it’s time that water company bosses took responsibility for that.

Tougher action is needed to address poor performance by water companies, which is why I am pleased Ofwat is going further today on bonus payments. In cases where companies have committed criminal breaches there is no justification whatsoever for paying out bonuses. It needs to stop now.

I will shortly be setting out more detail on further steps to clean up our waters, including reducing the reliance on water company self-monitoring in order to hold them to account and drive the improvements we all need to see.

The change follows the Environment Secretary’s recent meeting with water company chief executives where he set out his expectations on performance – and also builds onOfwat’s announcement last year to tighten restrictions on bonuses.

The policy would be expected to apply to FY24/25 bonuses from April onwards – but the government is clear that companies should follow these proposed new criteria for FY23/24 bonuses on a voluntary basis.",Ban on bonuses for water company executives following serious criminal breaches,Legislative,Welfare,id25_570

The State Pension age is regularly reviewed to make sure that the State Pension is affordable and fair. People are living longer, and spending a larger proportion of their adult life in retirement than in the past.

When the State Pension was introduced in 1948, a 65-year-old could expect to spend 13.5 years in receipt of it – around 23% of their adult life. This has been increasing ever since. In 2017, a 65-year-old can now expect to live for another 22.8 years, or 33.6% of their adult life.

Latestprojections from the Office for National Statisticsshow that the number of people over State Pension age in the UK is expected to grow by a third between 2017 and 2042, from 12.4 million in 2017 to 16.9 million in 2042.

Under the current law, the State Pension age is due to increase to 68 between 2044 and 2046.

Following a recent review, the government has announced plans to bring this timetable forward. The State Pension age would therefore increase to 68 between 2037 and 2039.

These proposed changes would have to be approved by Parliament before they are agreed.

Those affected by this proposed timetable will on average continue to spend longer in receipt of the State Pension than anyone reaching State Pension age in the last 25 years.

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, David Gauke, said:

I want Britain to be the best country in the world in which to grow old, where everyone enjoys the dignity and security they deserve in retirement.

Since 1948 the State Pension has been an important part of society, providing financial security to all in later life. As life expectancy continues to rise and the number of people in receipt of State Pension increases, we need to ensure that we have a fair and sustainable system that is reflective of modern life and protected for future generations.

Combined with our pension reforms that are helping more people than ever save into a private pension and reducing pensioner poverty to a near record low, these changes will give people the certainty they need to plan ahead for retirement.

The proposed changes were informed by theindependent recommendations made by John Cridland CBEin March 2017.

No one born on or before 5 April 1970 will see a change to their current proposed State Pension age.

The Government will develop a new, statutory plan to protect and restore our natural environment with delivery plans to meet each of our ambitious Environment Act targets. This will focus on cleaning up our waterways, reducing waste across the economy, planting millions more trees, improving air quality and halting the decline in species by 2030.

The review will engage with stakeholders across environment and nature, farming, resources, waste and water sectors, working hand in glove with businesses, local authorities and civil society across the country to develop new ambitious plans to save nature.

“Nature is dying.

“Britain is one of the most nature depleted countries in the world. Our animal species face extinction. Our precious landscapes are in decline. Our rivers, lakes and seas are awash with sewage and pollution. Air pollution continues to plague our towns and cities

“Nature underpins everything – the economy, food, health and society - but we stand at a moment in history when nature needs us to defend it.

“That is why today we begin to chart a new course. Working with civil society, business and local government, we will develop an ambitious programme to turn the tide and save nature.”

The announcement comes as the government publishes theEnvironmental Improvement Plan Annual Progress Report.

The Government is committed to protecting and restoring nature and delivering the Environment Act targets. This review is an important step in turning the page on nature recovery and will provide the foundations for delivering these targets. This includes the Government’s manifesto promise to expand nature-rich habitats such as wetlands, peat bogs and forests so people can enjoy and wildlife can thrive, including on public land.

The announcement comes as the government publishes theEnvironmental Improvement Plan Annual Progress Report. This covers the actions taken under the previous government to deliver the EIP between 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024 and reveals that dire state of the natural environment.

The all-species indicator has shown an overall decline to around 69% of its starting value in 1970. In Great Britain, 16% of species are threatened with extinction.

Beach litter remains abundant on UK coastlines, with plastic items constituting over 88% of the total litter collected.

The Government is committed to improving the environment, and the Secretary of State has set outfive new prioritiesfor this next parliament to:

clean up rivers, lakes and seas;

create a roadmap to move Britain to a zero waste economy;

boost food security;

ensure nature’s recovery and

protect communities from the dangers of flooding.

The agreement signals the Parties’ continued commitment to the sustainable management of North Sea cod, haddock, plaice, whiting, herring and saithe to ensure the long-term viability of these stocks. The agreement has also established plans to review the distribution and management of shared stocks such as hake – a measure that aims to safeguard stocks which are important for the whole UK catching sector.

Negotiating as an independent coastal State, the UK has agreed catch levels for 2022 with Norway and the EU that provide fishing opportunities estimated to be worth around £190 million to the UK fishing industry, based on historic landing prices. This will provide certainty and stability for the industry ahead of the new year.

Fisheries Minister Victoria Prentis said:

I am pleased to announce we have concluded trilateral negotiations between the UK, EU and Norway.

We are proud to have led discussion to a positive conclusion as we seek to set a gold standard for the entire fishing industry.

We are confident that this agreement has struck a balance that will benefit both our fishing industry and ensure our marine environment is healthy and viable long into the future.

UK Government Minister for Scotland Malcolm Offord said:

As an independent coastal State the UK has agreed catch levels that provide opportunities estimated to be worth around £190 million to our fishing industry. I welcome the outcome of these negotiations as they provide certainty and stability for fishermen in Scotland and the rest of the UK while championing sustainability.

Throughout negotiations the UK, as chair, has advocated for stock management decisions based on the best science available to ensure sustainable agreements are made and stocks are protected for the interests of our industry and a healthy, viable marine environment.

Catch levels for five of the six stocks have been set in line with, or lower than, the level advised by scientists at the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).

The catch levels agreed for 2022 (compared to 2021) are:

The UK Government has worked closely throughout the negotiations with the Scottish Government and other administrations to reach this consensus which seeks to benefit the entire UK fishing industry.

An assessment on the number of individual TACs set consistent with ICES advice will be published on the conclusion of the UK’s annual fisheries negotiations.

As part of the world-first national scheme, almost 1 in 5 of all smokers in England will be provided with a vape starter kit alongside behavioural support to help them quit the habit as part of a series of new measures to help the government meet its ambition of being smokefree by 2030 - reducing smoking rates to 5% or less. Local authorities will be invited to take part in the scheme later this year and each will design a scheme which suits its needs, including deciding which populations to prioritise.

In a speech today, Health Minister Neil O’Brien will also announce that following the success of local schemes, pregnant women will be offered financial incentives to help them stop smoking. This will involve offering vouchers, alongside behavioural support, to all pregnant women who smoke by the end of next year.

The government will also consult on introducing mandatory cigarette pack inserts with positive messages and information to help people to quit smoking.

Additionally, there will be a crackdown on illicit vape sales as part of measures to stop children and non-smokers take up the habit - which is growing in popularity among young people.

Health Minister Neil O’Brien will say:

Up to 2 out of 3 lifelong smokers will die from smoking. Cigarettes are the only product on sale which will kill you if used correctly.

We will offer a million smokers new help to quit. We will be funding a new national ‘swap to stop’ scheme - the first of its kind in the world. We will work with councils and others to offer a million smokers across England a free vaping starter kit.

The new policies will deliver the government’s 3 aims to help more adults quit smoking, stop children and non-smokers from taking up vaping, and using vaping as a tool for established adult smokers to quit.

For those who quit, the risk of heart attack is halved after one year of quitting, ultimately halving the likelihood of ending up in a hospital bed or worse.

Supporting more women to have a smokefree pregnancy will reduce the number of babies born underweight or underdeveloped with health problems requiring neonatal and ongoing care. It will also reduce the risk of miscarriage and stillbirth.

Cutting smoking rates reduces the number of smoking-related illnesses needing to be treated, in turn reducing the pressure on the NHS, helping to deliver on our priority to cut NHS waiting lists.

NHS figures for 2021 showed that 9% of 11 to 15 year old children used e-cigarettes, up from 6% in 2018.

In recognition of the sharp increase, Minister O’Brien will launch a call for evidence on youth vaping to identify opportunities to reduce the number of children accessing and using vape products - and explore where government can go further.

Working with enforcement agencies and learning from the government’s work with Trading Standards on illicit tobacco, £3 million of new funding will also be provided to create a specialised ‘illicit vapes enforcement squad’ to enforce the rules on vaping and tackle illicit vapes and underage sales.

As part of the measures, HMRC and Border Force will also be publishing an updated strategy this year to tackle illicit tobacco. It will lay out strategically how we continue to target, catch and punish those involved in the illicit tobacco market.

Smoking prevalence in England in 2021 was 13% - the lowest on record thanks to measures such as doubling duty on cigarettes since 2010 and continued funding to local stop smoking services.

In 2021 to 2022, £68 million of public health grant funded was spent on stop smoking services by local authorities and nearly 100,000 people quit with the support of a stop smoking service.

In addition, £35 million has been committed to the NHS this year so that all smokers admitted to hospital will be offered NHS-funded tobacco treatment services.

However, 5.4 million people in England smoke tobacco which remains the single biggest cause of preventable illness and death. Up to 2 out of 3 lifelong smokers will die from smoking and recent data shows 1 in 4 deaths from all cancers were estimated to be from smoking.

Throughout this process, the UK’s approach has been evidence-based and in line with our commitments under the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). We have licensed vessels where sufficient evidence has been provided that demonstrates that a vessel qualifies for access under the TCA. Where that evidence has not been provided, licences have not been issued.

On direct replacement vessels, we have taken an approach in line with the TCA which provides stability and ensures the sustainability of our fisheries. Last night, following receipt of new evidence from the Commission, the UK licensed 18 replacement vessels on the basis of this methodology. Further technical work on 7 more licences for direct replacement vessels is scheduled to conclude on Monday.

Jersey has today announced that it can, following receipt of new data this week, issue permanent licences to an additional 5 qualifying vessels currently on temporary licences. This will take the total permanent licences issued by Jersey to 130.

In recent months, robust steps have been made under the Plan for Water withall 15,000 storm overflows now monitoredand the cap on civil penalties for pollution removed. Last week,Defra went further in announcing that water bosses are set to be bannedfrom receiving bonuses if a company has committed serious criminal breaches.

The Environment Agency (EA) is already ramping up inspections on water company assets, with over 930 completed this financial year. Today’s announcement goes further as water company inspections carried out by the EA will rise to 4000 a year by the end of March 2025, and then to 10,000 by April 2026. This will include an increase in unannounced inspections – strengthening oversight of water companies and reducing the reliance on water company self-monitoring, which was established in 2009.

Increased inspections and enforcement will be backed by around £55 million each year. This will be fully funded through increased grant-in-aid from Defra to the Environment Agency and additional funding from water quality permit charges levied on water companies, subject to apublic consultationclosing in March 2024.

We are clear that we need to get much tougher with unannounced inspections to bring an end to the routine lawbreaking we have seen from water companies, which is what this announcement will deliver.

We are going further to quadruple the Environment Agency’s regulatory capacity – allowing them to carry out 4,000 water company inspections by the end of the next financial year.

Last year we set out measures to transform the way we regulate the water industry to uncover non-compliance and drive better performance.
Today’s announcement builds on that. Campaign groups and the public want to see the Environment Agency better resourced to do what it does best, regulate for a better environment.

Proposals to get extra boots on the ground to increase inspection visits will help further strengthen our regulation of the industry.”

With 100% of storm overflows now monitored, data-driven analytics will also help the Environment Agency map discharges against rainfall more effectively so they can quickly direct new specialist officers to any sites at risk, identify any non-compliance and take action.

The EA is already conducting the largest ever criminal investigation into potential widespread non-compliance by water and sewerage companies at thousands of sewage treatment works. Since 2015, the EA has concluded 59 prosecutions against water and sewerage companies securing fines of over £150 million.

Patient safety is our top priority. There is no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children.

Paracetamol remains the recommended pain relief option for pregnant women when used as directed. Pregnant women should continue to follow existing NHS guidance and speak to their healthcare professional if they have questions about any medication during pregnancy. Untreated pain and fever can pose risks to the unborn baby, so it is important to manage these symptoms with the recommended treatment.

Our advice on medicines in pregnancy is based on rigorous assessment of the best available scientific evidence.  Any new evidence that could affect our recommendations would be carefully evaluated by our independent scientific experts.

We continuously monitor the safety of all medicines, including those used during pregnancy, through robust monitoring and surveillance. We encourage anyone to report any suspected side effects to us via the Yellow Card scheme.

Paracetamol is recommended as the first-choice painkiller for pregnant women, used at the lowest dose and for the shortest duration. If pain does not resolve, then patients are advised to seek advice from their healthcare professional. See NHS Guidance –Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility while taking paracetamol for adults

The MHRA regularly reviews the safety of paracetamol during pregnancy to ensure that the benefits to the patient and unborn baby outweigh any risks.

Patients should not stop taking their pain medicines as untreated pain and fever can pose risks to the unborn child.

Members of the public and healthcare professionals are encouraged to report any suspected side effect from medicines, including paracetamol, to the MHRA’sYellow Card scheme.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is responsible for regulating all medicines and medical devices in the UK by ensuring they work and are acceptably safe. All work is underpinned by robust and fact-based judgements to ensure that benefits justify any risks.

The MHRA is an executive agency of the Department of Health and Social Care.

The FCLP, launched at the inaugural Forest and Climate Leaders’ Summit, is a voluntary partnership of 26 countries committed to delivery, accountability and innovation following the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use, which was endorsed by more than 140 world leaders at COP26 last year to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation this decade. If achieved, this would deliver 10% of the climate mitigation action needed by 2030 to deliver on the Paris Agreement.

Chaired by the United States and Ghana, FCLP members represent a range of regions, major forest areas, and centres of commerce and finance. 60% of global GDP and over  33% the world’s forests are covered in this partnership.

All members of the FCLP are united by a common goal; each member must be committed to leading on at least one of the FCLP’s action areas. Through the FCLP, countries will lead the initiatives which will scale and drive delivery. The goal is to identify strategic areas where the FCLP can help implement or scale up both new and existing solutions, working closely with the private sector, civil society and community leaders.

As part of this, the United Kingdom has committed £1.5 billion finance for forests, as part of a wider £3bn ring fence for nature. As part of this, the UK is announcing a further £65m for the nature pillar of the Climate Investment Fund, which will place Indigenous people and local communities, who shoulder the burden of climate change, at the heart of forest protection across rainforests, cloud forests and island forests. The UK is also today announcing that we are working on a new programme of £90 million towards the protection of the Congo Basin as part of our promise to support this region. The Congo Basin is the world’s most efficient carbon sink, supports the livelihoods of over 80 million people, and is home to 10,000 species of tropical plants – as well as endangered species like forest elephants, chimpanzees and mountain gorillas.

Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak said:

For too long the world’s forests have been undervalued and underestimated. They are one of the great natural wonders of our world, and with the loss of our forests accounting for more than 10% of global emissions, protecting them is one of the best ways of getting us back on track to 1.5 degrees.

That’s why the UK put nature at the heart of COP26, and countries home to 90 per cent of the world’s forests committed not just to halting but reversing forest loss and land degradation by 2030.

Let’s build on what we have achieved and together secure this incredible legacy for our children and the many generations to come.

H. E Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, President of Ghana, said:

Forest loss can be averted. There is, however, the need for a dedicated space, globally, to provide the needed support and accountability checks to countries that are committed to delivering the Glasgow Leaders Declaration. The FCLP is a first and key step towards this goal, and Ghana supports and endorses, fully, the FCLP.

Olaf Scholz, Chancellor of Germany, said:

Our joint global commitment to halt deforestation and restore forests needs to be translated into concrete and scaled action on the ground that will benefit people, biodiversity and the climate. Germany has joined the Forests and Climate Leaders’ Partnership today since we are convinced that it provides a strong forum for international collaboration to progress on this front. To underpin our commitment, Germany will support the establishment of the partnership’s secretariat and is doubling its initial contribution to the Global Forest Finance Pledge to a total of 2 billion EUR.

At the inaugural Forest and Climate Leaders’ Summit, an alliance of government leaders, companies, financial actors and Indigenous peoples’ will report on progress. This includes:

Contributing countries demonstrating unparalleled levels of accountability and transparency. 12 countries will report a combined spend of $2.67 billion to support activities in developing countries, including restoring degraded land, tackling wildfires and supporting the rights of indigenous communities.

The FCLP will hold annual meetings to encourage accountability, including leader-level events at climate COPs. Starting in 2023, the FCLP will also publish an annual Global Progress Report that includes independent assessments of global progress toward the 2030 goal, as well as summarising progress made by the FCLP itself, including in its action areas and initiatives.

At the Summit, those who spoke alongside Prime Minister Rishi Sunak included: President Emmanuel Macron of France, President Akufo-Addo of Ghana, President Denis Sassou Nguesso of Congo, President Petro of Colombia, Chancellor Scholz of Germany, and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.","Financial commitment (£1.5 billion for forests, £65m for nature pillar, £90m for Congo Basin)",Welfare,,id25_579

Asked if they would be published at the same day every month, thePMSsaid, the plan would be for them to come out towards the end of each month.

Asked if there had been any research done on any possible impact to Britain’s Armed Forces if Trident was paid out of the Defence Budget, thePMSsaid the key thing was that the government was committed to a nuclear deterrent. The Strategic Defence Review (SDSR) was on going, as was the Spending Review and departmental spending will be considered in the round as part of this.

Asked if Trident should come out of the MoD Budget or the Treasury Budget, thePMSsaid that these were decisions for the Treasury as part of the Spending Review.

Asked if it was a decision that had to be taken from the very top, thePMSsaid the government is committed to the nuclear deterrent. The SDSR was on going, so too is the Spending Review.

Asked if the Prime Minister agreed with the Chancellor that the cost of replacing Trident should be part of the Ministry of Defence budget, thePMSsaid we are committed to the nuclear deterrent and all decisions regarding departmental spending plans were to be considered by the Chancellor and it was the Chancellor’s decision.

Asked if the Prime Minister was alarmed by two of his most senior Cabinet colleagues negotiating/arguing about this in public, thePMSsaid that the Prime Minister had already said he would not get into discussions between the Chancellor and Cabinet Ministers regarding the Spending Review.

Put that the Home Secretary thought that Trident should be a priority for MoD spending and did the Prime Minister agree, thePMSsaid the decisions would be made in the Spending Review.

Asked if the Prime Minister had accepted Iain Duncan Smith’s view that marginal pension rates had been made worse in the Budget, thePMSsaid the Work and Pensions Secretary had been very clear both in his speech and the media interviews this morning that our welfare system needed fundamental reform.

Asked for the Prime Minister’s view on the possibility of the programme costing more money, thePMSreferred to comments of the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions that over the last 10 years we had spent £60 billion more on the benefits system which is unsustainable. We need to get people out of the poverty trap, stuck on benefits, and in to work, which would benefit the economy.",Strategic Defence Review (SDSR) and Spending Review,Institutional,Other,id25_581
582,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/bypass-is-best-a5036-option-says-highways-england,Press release,Bypass is best A5036 option says Highways England,Highways England has reiterated its view that building a new bypass is the best option to replace the A5036 Port of Liverpool route in Merseyside.,Highways England,21 December 2017,"The company confirmed today it would formally defend its decision to opt for a bypass after Sefton Council applied for a judicial review on the basis that a tunnel option was not included as part of the public consultation.

Following the consultation earlier this year, Highways England announced in August it had decided to take forward the design of a new bypass through Rimrose Valley rather than try to improve the existing route between the port and Switch Island junction where the road meets the M57 and M58 motorways.

Highways England announced in the summer it had chosen the bypass option (above)

Highways England chief executive Jim O Sullivan said:

The considerable cost and disruption of constructing a tunnel and ongoing maintenance and operational costs meant it was never going to be a viable solution.

A bypass will provide similar long-term benefits to a tunnel – an almost junction-free link between the port and motorway network - at a significantly lower cost with less construction disruption and a much shorter delivery time when pressure on the existing road is increasing all the time.

We want to continue talking to the council and local people to ensure we deliver an A5036 Port of Liverpool route which can support the local and regional economy.

The existing route is often heavily congested with vehicle numbers increasing

Explaining why a tunnel was never put forward as an option at the consultation, Tim Gamon, Highways England’s regional delivery director for the North West, said a bypass would deliver the same economic benefits as a tunnel but while a tunnel would cost more than £1.5 billion the cost of a bypass was around £250 million.

Mr Gamon said:

The tunnel simply does not provide value for money.  Furthermore, the impact of delivering a tunnel through the park would mean the whole of the Rimrose Valley would potentially be ‘out of bounds’ for recreational use - including the sports pitches – for up to 6 years due to the scale of the construction and safety zones required.

Highways England is working on ideas to help mitigate the impact of a new bypass on the country park, park users and people living nearby, with a package of mitigation and environmental improvement measures including landscaping, planted screening, noise barriers and improved leisure facilities and pedestrian and cyclist links through the valley.

An artist's impression of how the current A5036 could be transformed if replaced by a bypass

Delivering a bypass would mean handing back the existing A5036 to local people to provide a clear separation of local traffic from commercial and commuter traffic between the port and motorway network.  Highways England will transform the existing A5036 - delivering improved cycling facilities, better crossing and footpaths, improved connectivity on the inter-city routes crossing the road to benefit local communities.

Following extensive consultation with industry and manufacturers, the mandate provides them with the certainty they have called for to safeguard skilled British jobs.

Technology and Decarbonisation Minister Anthony Browne will visit a newbppulse hub in London today to mark the occasion, where he will see their ultra-fastEVchargers in action and meet drivers who are benefiting from the facility.

The zero emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate sets out the percentage of new zero emission cars and vans manufacturers will be required to produce each year up to 2030. 80% of new cars and 70% of new vans sold in Great Britain will now be zero emission by 2030, increasing to 100% by 2035.

This follows the pragmatic decision taken by the Prime Minister to delay the ban on new diesel and petrol cars from 2030 to 2035, putting theUKin line with other major global economies such as France, Germany, Sweden and Canada. This allows time for consumers to make the choice to switch to electric, and to level up our charging infrastructure.

TheUKhas overdelivered on every carbon budget to date, having cut greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 50% since 1990. Recent Climate Change Committee analysis shows our more pragmatic approach has no material difference on our progress to cutting emissions, and households will now have more time to make the transition, saving some thousands of pounds at a time when the cost of living is high.

Technology and Decarbonisation Minister Anthony Browne said:

Alongside us having spent more than £2 billion in the transition to electric vehicles, our zero emission vehicle mandate will further boost the economy and support manufacturers to safeguard skilled British jobs in the automotive industry.

We are providing investment certainty for the charging sector to expand our charging network which has already grown by 44% since this time last year. This will support the constantly growing number ofEVsin theUK, which currently account for over 16% of the newUKcar market.

In a boost for the economy, the new laws will help households make the switch to electric, supporting growth ofEVsales in the second-hand market and incentivising charging to roll out more widely across the country.

The government’s schemes to lower the upfront and running costs of owning anEVincludes theplug-in van grantof up to £2,500 for small vans and £5,000 for large vans until at least 2025 and £350 off the cost ofhomeplace chargepoints for people living in flats.

Lateststatisticsshow that there has been a 41% increase in zero emission vehicles registered for the first time.

TheUK’s charging network continues to grow at pace – there are now over 50,000 public chargepoints, with 44% more than this time last year, putting the country well on track to reach 300,000 chargepoints by 2030. The certainty of theZEVmandate will give industry renewed confidence to invest in our infrastructure.

Additionally, last month theUKandEUagreed to extend trade rules on electric vehicles, saving manufacturers and consumers up to £4.3 billion in additional costs and providing long-term certainty for industry.

Akira Kirton, Vice President,bppulseUK, said:

We are pleased to host the minister at our most powerfulEVcharging hub in central London to mark the start of theZEVmandate.

This mandate instils confidence in our strategy, reaffirming our plans to invest £1 billion over 10 years to continue to develop hundreds ofEVcharging hubs across the country by 2030 to bolster theUK’s charging infrastructure.

Our approach to decarbonising transport has already attracted record investment in gigafactories andEVmanufacturing, including:

The government also continues to support the rollout ofEVinfrastructure. Applications for the first round of the £381 millionLocalEVInfrastructure Fundare currently being assessed. This funding will deliver tens of thousands more chargepoints in local areas across England and transform the availability of charging for drivers without off-street parking. The government has also launched a £70 million pilot to support the deployment of ultra-rapid charging points at motorway service areas.

Andrew Brem, General Manager of UberUK, said:

London is Uber’s top city forEVsworldwide, with well over 10,000 electric vehicles on the platform in the capital. However, the availability and up-front cost ofEVscan still be a barrier for many drivers.

TheZEVmandate coming into force is a significant moment which will help to drive down the costs ofEVsand increase supply – accelerating the uptake ofEVsover the next decade.

As part of ourPlan for drivers, we intend to consult on ways to make installations cheaper and quicker for chargepoint operators, review the grid connections process for chargepoints, and also consult on the expansion of permitted development rights to make installations easier.

Through the Environment Bill, we will clean up the country’s air, restore natural habitats and increase biodiversity. The Bill will also outline how the government will reduce waste, make better use of resources, and improve management of water resources in a changing climate.

The Bill will crack down on water companies that discharge sewage into rivers and will include a world-leading legally-binding species target for 2030, aiming to halt the decline of nature and to protect beloved British animals, such as red squirrels and hedgehogs.

Welcoming the Environment Bill back to Parliament, Environment Minister Rebecca Pow said:

As we build back greener from the pandemic, it is vital that we address the twin challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss and protect and improve the environment for future generations.

The Environment Bill will ensure we deliver the most ambitious environmental programme of any country on earth, which is why it is essential that we complete its passage into law as soon as possible.

The Government has proposed a number of amendments to the Bill upon its return to Parliament.

We are aiming to halt the decline of nature by amending the Bill to require the Government to set and meet anew legally-binding target on species abundance for 2030. This builds on plans to boost biodiversity, protect our peatlands and create new woodlands as set out last week by the Environment Secretary.

The Environment Bill will also re-focus the Habitats Regulations towards our objective to conserve and enhance biodiversity, and the Government will publish a Green Paper on these reforms later this year. The Green Paper will set out how we plan to deliver our domestic ambitions, as part of our objective of protecting 30 percent of terrestrial land by 2030. We want to ensure our regulatory framework is fit for purpose to drive the delivery of our new 2030 biodiversity target and reverse declines of species, including iconic British species like the hedgehog, red squirrel and water vole.

As announced in the Queen’s Speech on 11 May, we will also be bringing forward amendments later this year toreduce the harm from storm overflows to our rivers, waterways and coastlines. New duties will require the government to publish a plan to reduce sewage discharges from storm overflows by September 2022 and report to Parliament on the progress towards implementing the plan.

Work on implementing Environment Bill policies has continued at pace. We have already started work on developing legally binding environmental targets, and launchedconsultations on the deposit return schemes for drinks containers, extended producer responsibility for packagingandconsistent recycling collectionswhich will transform the way we deal with our rubbish.

We haveappointed Dame Glenys Stacey as Chair of the new, independent Office for Environmental Protection (OEP), which will be created to hold the Government and public bodies to account for their environmental credentials. From July, it will be set up in an interim, non-statutory form, providing independent oversight of the Government’s environmental progress and accelerating the foundation of the full body. The OEP will formally commence its statutory functions after the Bill receives Royal Assent.

We have also published adraft Principles Policy Statementwhich will put protecting the environment at the heart of future policy.

The legislation builds on this Government’s decisive action to protect the environment asset out in our 25 Year Environment Plan. Our binding commitment to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 andhost the COP26 climate change conferencethis year will keep the UK at the forefront of international work on these issues.",New duties requiring the government to publish a plan to reduce sewage discharges from storm overflows by September 2022 and report to Parliament on the progress towards implementing the plan.,Administrative,Legislative,id25_584

One of the Prime Minister’s priority sectors for economic growth, the creative industries are a global British success story growing at more than 1.5 times the rate of the wider economy over the past decade and contributing £108 billion in gross value added (GVA) annually.

Employment in these industries has grown at five times the rate of the rest of the economy since 2011. Speaking at the London Tech Week conference on Monday, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that Britain’s creative industries were “going like gangbusters” and represent a “unique strength” for the country.

Developed with industry via the Creative Industries Council, theCreative Industries Sector Visionpublished today sets out shared ambitions to build on that success and maximise the growth of the creative industries by £50 billion by 2030, creating one million extra jobs and delivering a creative careers promise that builds a pipeline of future talent.

Framed around the key principles for driving growth - facilitating innovation and investment, alongside building a skilled workforce - the Sector Vision is backed by £77 million in new government investment for the sector.

The Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, said:

The creative industries are a true British success story, from global music stars like Adele and Ed Sheeran to world-class cultural institutions like the National Theatre.

These industries have a special place in our national life and make a unique contribution to how we feel about ourselves as a country.

We want to build on this incredible success to drive growth in our economy - one of my key priorities – and to ensure that UK creative industries continue to lead the world long into the future.

Backed up with significant new funding, this ambitious plan will help grow the sector by an extra £50 billion while creating one million extra jobs by 2030.

Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer said:

The imagination and ingenuity of British designers, producers, content creators, writers and artists are spearheading growth right across our economy.

The government is backing our creatives to maximise the potential of the creative industries. This Sector Vision is about driving innovation, attracting investment and building on the clusters of creativity across the country. And from first days at school to last days of work, we will nurture the skills needed to build a larger creative workforce to harness the talent needed for continued success.

Working with the industry this vision is helping the UK creative sectors go from strength to strength - providing jobs and opportunities, creating world leading content and supporting economic growth across the country.

Jeremy Hunt, Chancellor of the Exchequer, said:

Our Creative Industry isn’t just about the glitz and glam of the red carpet in Leicester Square. It brings in £108 billion a year to help fund our public services, supports over 2 million jobs, and is world renowned.

That’s why we’re backing it as an industry to drive our economic growth, keeping the UK at the top of the world’s cultural charts with a multi-million pound boost.

This includes £50 million to grow clusters of creative businesses in locations all over the country, and more funding to help start-ups scale-up and to turn creative entrepreneurs into CEOs.

New investment will help the next Adele, Ed Sheeran or Sam Smith break into overseas markets, alongside financial support for new video games studios and hundreds of grassroots music venues. The government will continue to offer competitive creative industries tax reliefs to incentivise production of film, TV and video games in the UK.This sector vision builds on more than £230 million in government spending on the creative industries since 2021, which includes £75.6 million to build the largest virtual production research and development network in Europe to put the UK at the forefront of advancements in visual effects, motion-capture technology, and AI for the screen industries and live performance. Today the government has announced regional research labs will be based in Yorkshire, Dundee and Belfast with a national lab in Buckinghamshire. The programme will be supported with an additional £63 million investment from industry.

Alongside investment, the Sector Vision commits the government to a new creative careers promise - a pledge backed by a comprehensive package of actions to open up more opportunities, particularly for young people, to pursue careers in the creative industries.

Sir Peter Bazalgette, industry co-Chair of the Creative Industries Council said:

The Creative Industries are coming of age with this ambitious policy framework for economic growth and cultural value. Our Sector Vision, developed jointly with government, champions R&D-led innovation and future skills, drawing on the talent of all our communities. It also promotes positive impact on health & wellbeing, the environment & Britain’s global reach. Helped by the government’s new spending commitments, the work starts now to deliver on this growth agenda.

Four new state-of-the-art research and development facilities will be set up to drive the next generation of screen technology and on-set virtual production, with £63 million of new industry investment announced today on top of the government’s £75.6 million investment. UKRI’s Convergent Screen Technologies and performance in Realtime (CoSTAR) programme is expected to create more than 820 new jobs across the UK.

The government will invest at least £50 million in the next wave of UKRI’sCreative Industries Clusters programme. This funding will be used to identify and support at least six new clusters specialising in creative subsectors, helping entrepreneurs and businesses in these areas innovate with new technologies, secure investment, and access global markets. It comes as more than 300 creative companies across the UK receive a share of £13 million in government grants today to help them innovate and reach their high growth potential.

DCMS will increase the budget of theCreate Growth Programmeby £10.9 million, bringing it to a total of £28.4 million until 2025. The increased funding will enable it to double the number of regions it covers to twelve and support 2,000 businesses to commercialise their ideas and access resources, knowledge and private investment to scale up - turning today’s creative entrepreneurs into tomorrow’s CEOs.

Funding for theMusic Exports Growth Scheme, which provides grants to support touring and help emerging musicians break into new global markets, will be expanded to £3.2 million over the next two years. Past recipients include BRIT award winners Wolf Alice, Dave and Catfish and the Bottlemen, as well as Mercury Prize Winners Young Fathers and BRIT Rising Star nominee beabadoobee.

DCMS will expand Arts Council England’s highly successfulSupporting Grassroots Music Venues Fund, providing an additional £5 million over two years to support around 400 grassroots music venues projects, as the lifeblood of our world-leading music sector and cornerstones of communities.

TheUK Games Fundwill receive a £5 million uplift bringing its total funding to £13.4 million over the next two years. Since 2015 the fund has been developing talent and awarding grants to young video game developers and early-stage studios to turn their drawing board ideas into working prototype games and showcase them to investors. The additional funding will mean it can help maturer start-ups grow their businesses and attract even more private investment into our booming video games industry.

Acknowledging UK excellence in holding international showcase events which enhance our soft power and boost creative exports, ministers have agreed new funding of £2 million will go to London Fashion Week for 2023-25 and £1.7 million for the BFI to deliver the London Film Festival 2024.

The Sector Vision’s creative careers promise commits the government to working closely with the industry to give young people from all backgrounds more opportunities to participate in creative activities from an early age, in order to build a highly-skilled, productive and inclusive creative workforce. To support these aims, DCMS and the Department for Education will:

Publish the Cultural Education Plan later this year, deliver last year’s National Plan for Music Education which includes £25 million for musical instruments, and explore opportunities for enrichment activities as part of the government’s wraparound childcare provision.

Work with industry to ensure post-16 technical skills routes work effectively for the creative industries. This will include supporting the rollout of T-Levels in creative subjects and increasing provision and take-up of high quality creative apprenticeships.

Support lifelong learning in the creative industries and enable the sector to retain and retrain the existing workforce by working with local and regional partners to maximise the opportunities of Skills Bootcamps and to develop Local Skills Improvement Plans across England.

Business and Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch said:

The UK has a global reputation for creating, writing and producing amazing music and the Creative Industries generate over £50 billion in exports for the UK economy and are a key driver for UK growth. The Department for Business and Trade is committed to championing our world class artists and businesses around the world by doubling creative trade missions and expanding support for exporters in the creative industries.

UK Research and Innovation Creative Industries Sector Champion, Professor Christopher Smith, said:

The creative industries are a UK success story, key to the UK’s prosperity, wellbeing and resilience. From design to screen, fashion and textiles to heritage, they are generating high-quality employment and innovation.

UKRI’s creative industries investments, including CoSTAR, Creative Catalyst and the Creative Industry Clusters Programme, will catalyse the research and innovation that are crucial for this fast-growing and important sector.

The creative industries are now firmly embedded in the research and development ecosystem, ensuring that the UK remains a genuine world leader in the industries of the future.

Caroline Norbury OBE, Chief Executive, Creative UK & Creative Industries Council member

The UK Government’s Sector Vision recognises and cements the Creative Industries’ immense capacity for growth, and rightly prioritises much-needed investment in the sector. Creative UK, our members, and colleagues across the Creative Industries, stand ready to further unleash the power of creativity, so that together we can drive inclusive growth across all parts of the UK.

BRIT Awards Rising Star nominee beabadoobee said:

The funding from the Music Export Growth Scheme came at a great point in my career and gave me a helping hand. I’m happy to know the scheme is being extended and more money will be coming into music to help even more new artists breakthrough. This will all help in building artists fanbases in the UK and around the world.

The national CoSTAR lab and three regional R&D labs will ensure the UK has the skills and infrastructure to stay on the cutting-edge of new virtual production techniques in film, TV and live events which involve using computer-generated imagery (CGI), augmented reality and motion capture to create ‘virtual sets’. Instead of adding visual effects and CGI in post-production, virtual production allows filmmakers and theatre directors to create large-scale digitally-generated environments using LED panels that performers can interact with in real-time, as a quicker and less expensive alternative to green screens. The technology has been used in the ABBA Voyage live concert and the Batman and Minecraft immersive experiences in the UK, as well on Disney’s hit show The Mandalorian.

Today’s announcement of the preferred bidders for CoSTAR is subject to internal government approvals processes, and where relevant, commercial discussions with external partners. Partner organisations such as BT, the National Film and Television School, Vodafone, Studio Ulster and Screen Yorkshire have today announced they will invest at least £63.3 million in CoSTAR. The programme will also include an Insight and Foresight Unit led by Goldsmiths and the BFI. More information on the CoStar preferred bidders:

Creative Industries Clusters programme

The creative industries tend to concentrate in geographic areas, forming ‘clusters’ - groups of creative businesses which grow quicker together by collaborating and competing with each other. Since 2018, the Arts and Humanities Research Council’s Creative Industries Clusters programme has supported nine creative clusters in the UK.

Further quotes from recording artists who have previously benefitted from the Music Exports Growth Scheme:

Femi Koleoso from Ezra Collective said:

Touring is one of the most important ways we’ve been able to connect with our fans - it’s such a special moment to see music that you’ve written and recorded connect with people in real life. We’re so thankful to the smaller, grass roots venues across the country and further afield as part of our worldwide touring that offer a sanctuary and a first chance for so many artists. They are vital to the infastructure of touring, and for artists that are really looking to build a career in music. Playing a Hammersmith Apollo show has an extra special meaning when you’ve played a show at Fox and Firkin as part of the journey. And playing St Davids Hall means the most when you kicked off your live journey in Cardiff at the Gwidhw. There’s no Glastonbury festival without being given a chance at Thekla.

Tom Speight said:

The Creative Sector Vision and its investment into music is to be welcomed.  As an artist who has directly benefitted from Music Export Growth Scheme funding in the past - helping me to land a No.1 single in Brazil - and who is looking to grow my fan base across the UK from playing grass route venues to performing to thousands of people, I know only too well just how much of a difference any kind of funding boost will make. I hope this acts as a base for more support in future.

Yazmin Lacy said:

Being able to tour my debut album was an incredibly special opportunity - and without the support of MEGS current cost and visa pressures would have literally meant this to be impossible. It would have meant an opportunity to realise the true potential of my music and lay solid foundations to grow and move towards considering myself a career artist would have had to have been abandoned. I am so grateful to be able to build further on the amazing foundations MEG funding enabled me, specifically in North America - already planning a return headline tour based on the reception to my first. It’s quite honestly invaluable and there’s no other way I would have been able to take that leap otherwise.

Stephen Page, Chair of Faber & Faber said:

The golden thread of education and skills pathways that support careers for all in the creative industries is vital to their continued growth and outstanding success. I welcome the Sector Vision’s commitment to building the future workforce our industry needs, with opportunities for people from all backgrounds, and look forward to continued close working between Government and Industry towards realising that goal.

Sophie Jones, Chief Strategy Officer and Interim CEO of the British Phonographic Institute said:

At a time when UK artists face greater competition than ever before in a now truly global music market, the Music Export Growth Scheme is an invaluable resource for those independent artists and music companies looking to export their music around the world. The scheme is already well over-subscribed, and with this additional investment, the scheme will be able to help even more deserving artists achieve global success. We are delighted that the Government has recognised the excellent return on investment that MEGS presents and has moved to support independent artists and music in this way.

Daniel Wood, Co-CEO of video games trade body Ukie said:

The games industry welcomes the Secretary of State’s ambition to boost the creatives industries. Today’s vision cements what we have always said that the UK games industry is an engine of economic growth - creating high quality jobs across the whole of the UK, contributing over £5 billion in GVA with 80 per cent outside London and Southeast.

We are also pleased to see that the government continues to recognise the importance of the country’s games industry and is committing an additional £5 million to the UK Games Fund. Today’s announcement of additional funding will support even more UK games businesses to scale up by accessing the finance they need to create the next generation of games, whilst also developing the innovative and original content a global audience of billions love.

Francesca Hegyi, Chief Executive of Edinburgh International Festival said:

I am pleased to welcome the launch of the joint Government and Creative Industry Council’s Sector Vision today and it fills me with optimism about the future of the creative industries in the UK. The vision sets a path for enhanced collaboration as well as a renewed focus on inclusivity and innovation. With the Council now embracing a truly UK-wide perspective, the potential for our industry to lead the way has never been stronger.

Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, Chief Executive of UK Music said:

This new investment is hugely welcome and will deliver a significant boost to the Music Export Growth Scheme and to grassroots music venues across the country.

In an increasingly competitive global environment, it’s vital we give our world-leading creative industries the support they need to continue creating high quality jobs and contributing billions to the economy.

We look forward to continuing to work with the Government to make the UK the best place to create, innovate, produce and consume music.

Welsh Government Deputy Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Dawn Bowden, said:

We welcome the new sector vision for the creative industries and the acknowledgement of the devolved nature of the majority of the activity included within it. It is positive that Wales now has a voice around the Creative Industries Council table and we look forward to working in partnership to help grow our vibrant creative industries in Wales.

The consultation presents the commission’s analysis of the proposals shortlisted by the commission last year: two for expansion at Heathrow Airport and one proposal at Gatwick Airport.

It invites public comment on the commission’s detailed consideration of each proposal. This includes analysis of the cost of each proposal, the effect on communities of noise, property loss and construction, and the economic benefits and environmental impacts.

Sir Howard Davies said:

Since ourInterim reportlast year we have undertaken a huge amount of work. We have carried out a thorough assessment, across a comprehensive range of subjects, looking at the benefits and impacts of each proposal.

We have not yet taken a view on which proposal strikes the most effective balance between the assessment criteria. It is important first that we provide an opportunity for this evidence to be examined, challenged and improved. This consultation gives everyone with an interest in the issue of airport expansion that opportunity.

Responses to this consultation will be a valuable addition to our evidence base and will directly inform our recommendation to the government when we publish our final report in the summer of 2015.

The information included in this consultation will enable respondents to give their view on the strengths and weaknesses of each short-listed option. It also invites comment on the commission’s review of the underlying evidence and analysis. These comments will then be taken into account and used to validate and challenge the commission’s assessments, ahead of the final report in the summer of 2015.

During the consultation the Airports Commission will hold open discussion sessions for local stakeholders in both the Heathrow and Gatwick areas. The consultation will close on 3 February 2015.

The Airports Commission was set up by the government in November 2012 as an independent body to examine the scale and timing of any requirement for additional capacity to maintain the UK’s position as Europe’s most important aviation hub. It will identify and evaluate how any need for additional capacity should be met in the short, medium and long term.

The Airports Commission is chaired by Sir Howard Davies. Its other members are:

In its interim report, published in December 2013, the commission identified a need for 1 net additional runway in London and the south east and shortlisted for detailed appraisal and public consultation three proposals to deliver this capacity:

In January 2014, the commission published for consultation a ‘Draft appraisal framework’ that it intended to use as the basis of its assessments of the 3 shortlisted options. Thefinalised ‘Appraisal framework’was published in April 2014.

In itsInterim report, the commission also announced its intention to carry out further study into the feasibility of an airport in the inner Thames estuary before taking a decision on whether or not to add this option to its shortlist. Following a wide-ranging call for evidence and 4 detailed feasibility studies, in September 2014 the commission announced itsdecision not to shortlist the inner Thames estuary option.

The detailed appraisal outputs for the 3 shortlisted options have been published for consultation today. The commission’s consultation documents have been published on GOV.UK.

The documents published today include:

The commission’s has also published the updated scheme designs submitted by the short-listed promoters in May 2014.

Theconsultation period will run for 12 weeks until Tuesday 3 February (2014).

Government websites rarely have mass appeal. But a few months ago, one of our sites got up to 18 million hits in a single hour. Indeed, the volume of traffic was so great, the servers crashed. Were we handing out free money? Not quite. The reason millions flocked to this site is because, for the first time, we published street-level crime maps, showing exactly what crimes had been committed across the whole of England and Wales.

This incredible demand shows the power of transparency, and why we need more of it. Information is power. It lets people hold the powerful to account, giving them the tools they need to take on politicians and bureaucrats. It gives people new choices and chances, allowing them to make informed judgments about their future. And it lets our professionals judge themselves against one another, and our entrepreneurs develop new products and services.

In so many ways, information is a national asset, and it’s time it was shared. That’s why, since last year, we have published stacks of new data. Right now you can go online and look at the salaries of senior officials, the contracts signed by central and local government, and the breakdown of public spending.But if the past 12 months have been about opening up Whitehall, the next 12 months must be about opening up public services. So today, we are making new commitments to transparency. For the first time, the raw data that will allow you to analyse the performance of public services will be made freely available.Some may say: what’s new here? After all, we already have things like school league tables. But what we’re proposing is something entirely different. League tables are once-a-year snapshots of what is happening in our education system, with an exclusive focus on exam results. With our new plans, you’ll be able to drill down into the performance of individual schools, checking their exam results by subject area, absence rates and the quality of teaching.

Our aim is to provide similar information on performance right across the public services. So now, you’ll be able to compare the health outcomes of individual GP practices and hospital departments. You’ll be able to see not just what crimes have been committed on your street, but what action the police have taken. You’ll also know about congestion on local roads and delays on your railway line. And in all these areas, the data will be updated regularly.

This is a complete revolution in transparency - and it’s going to have a profound impact. First, it will enable choice, particularly for patients and parents. Next week, we are publishing our White Paper on the future of our public services. Professionals will see their discretion restored. And we will have real freedom to choose which hospital we get treated in or which school our child goes to. But for that choice to be meaningful, it must be informed.

Second, it will raise standards. All the evidence shows that when you give professionals information about other people’s performance, there’s a race to the top as they learn from the best. For example, five years ago, it was made far easier for the public to access, understand and use data on survival rates following heart surgery. And guess what happened? Those survival rates rose dramatically. Our doctors, teachers and police officers are passionate about driving up performance and being the best. Speak to them and they’ll tell you they desperately want this information, and this opportunity.

Third, this information is going to help us mend our economy. To begin with, it’s going to save money. Already, the information we have published on public spending has rooted out waste, stopped unnecessary duplication and put the brakes on ever-expanding executive salaries. Combine that with this new information on the performance of our public services, and there will be even more pressure to get real value for taxpayers’ money.

But transparency can help with the other side of the economic equation too - boosting enterprise. Estimates suggest the economic value of government data could be as much as £6 billion a year. Why? Because the possibilities for new business opportunities are endless. Imagine the innovations that could be created - the apps that provide up-to-date travel information; the websites that compare local school performance. But releasing all this data won’t just support new start-ups - it will benefit established industries too.

Take pharmaceuticals, an industry that employs hundreds of thousands of people across the UK. The data we are releasing will enable medical researchers to look at how different drugs work in real-life populations, helping to make the UK the most attractive place in the world for research and development of the next generation of life-saving drugs. Not only will that benefit patients, but it will help to create new jobs and economic opportunities.

Sometimes in government you do things knowing that if another party came to power they might try to reverse them later. Sometimes, you do things knowing that the changes you make are here to stay. In the years to come, people will look back at the days when government kept all its data - your data - in vaults and think how strange it was that the taxpayers - the people who actually own all this - were locked out. But this whole process isn’t something government can do alone - you need to play your part too. Use this information, exploit it, hold your public services to account. They are there for you, so make them work for you.",Publication of street-level crime maps and performance data,Informational,,id25_587

Mr Cameron said that it was a real honour to turn on the floodlights for the first time.

He added:

Today we’re shining a light on this stadium and the brilliant work that’s been done on the Olympic Park so far. In 2012 a light will shine on all of our country as billions look on. I want the world to see that Britain is a confident, forward-looking country - a great place to live, work, invest and do business.

The stadium itself is lit by over 532 individual floodlights housed in 15 towers suspended 70 meters above the field of play - in order to meet the high definition TV standards required.

The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) has also announced that the installation of the spectator seats has been completed in the Stadium, ensuring that the venue remains on track to be finished more than a year before the Games in the summer of 2012.

Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport Jeremy Hunt said:

London’s Olympic Stadium is breathtaking. Seeing it lit up, like it will be for 2012 and beyond, is incredibly exciting. The switching on of the lights is a huge milestone in our preparations for what will be a fantastic Games in 2012.

Tens of thousands of charities providing vital services will benefit from direct cash grants to ensure they can meet increased demand as a result of the virus as well as continuing their day-to-day activities supporting those in need.

As part of a UK-wide package of support, £360 million will be directly allocated by government departments to charities providing key services and supporting vulnerable people during the crisis.

As well as this, £370 million for small and medium-sized charities, including through a grant to the National Lottery Community Fund for those in England, will support those organisations at the heart of local communities which are making a big difference during the outbreak, including those delivering food, essential medicines and providing financial advice.

The Chancellor also announced the Government will match fund whatever the public decides to donate to the BBC’s Big Night In charity appeal on 23 April, starting with a contribution of at least £20 million to the National Emergencies Trust appeal.

Today’s announcement builds on previous announcements by the Chancellor to support charities and businesses, including deferring their VAT bills, paying no business rates for their shops next year, and furloughing staff where possible with the Government paying 80% of their wages.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said:

Our charities are playing a crucial role in the national fight against coronavirus, supporting those who are most in need.

It’s right we do everything we can to help the sector during this difficult time, which is why we have announced this unprecedented £750 million package of extra funding.

This will ensure our key charities can continue to deliver the services that millions of people up and down the country rely on.

Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said:

Our brilliant charities are already playing a crucial role in our national effort to fight coronavirus - backed up by an army of volunteers. We’re determined to support them and match the generosity being shown by the British people. This package will make sure those on the front line are able to reach people who need help most, support communities and take pressure off our NHS.

Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock said:

The entire charity sector has stepped up as part of our national effort to tackle coronavirus – from helping our NHS heroes to ensuring the most vulnerable among us are cared for properly.

Hospices have suffered a huge challenge to their funding due to the outbreak of coronavirus but at the same time continued to play a vital role in delivering compassionate, quality end-of-life care for many people. I am delighted that this cash boost will provide further financial stability and support them to increase capacity of NHS Services and provide stability as we manage our response to coronavirus.

It’s vitally important we all continue to support our fantastic and hardworking hospices and their staff during this unprecedented time, and the whole country is grateful for the incredible work they do.

Charities providing vital services and helping vulnerable people through the current crisis will benefit from the £360 million allocated by government departments. These will include:

Departments will now work at pace to identify priority recipients, with the aim for charities to receive money in the coming weeks. The application system for the National Lottery Community Fund grant pot is expected to be operational within a similar period of time.

Where charitable services are devolved the UK Government has applied the Barnett formula in the normal way. We expect the devolved administrations to receive £60 million through the charities pot, and further significant Barnett allocations, dependent on the final proposals funded, through the direct grant pot. We encourage the devolved administrations to use this funding to support charities.

Reaction from charity sector:

Charlotte Moore, Director of BBC Content said:

“The Big Night In promises to be a fantastic evening of entertainment and we welcome this support. We want to help as many people as possible through this crisis. These funds will be shared by the huge number of smaller charities and projects who are making a vital difference to so many communities up and down the country.”

Tracey Bleakley, CEO from national charity Hospice UK, said:

Hospice UK is delighted that the Government is providing up to £200 million of funding per quarter to hospices to help support the NHS and respond to the COVID-19 emergency.

Hospices are on the frontline of providing care and support to almost a quarter of a million vulnerable people every year at the end of their lives. This unprecedented funding recognises the vital role that hospices play in supporting the NHS in its fight against COVID-19, and means hospices across the country can keep providing beds, specialist clinical care and staffing to relieve pressure on the NHS at this critical moment.

Hospices depend on the generosity of their local communities to care for people and families affected by terminal illness.  This incredible government support is very welcome but it’s still important that people continue to support their local hospice.

Hospice UK is working with the NHS to disburse this much-needed funding as soon as possible so we can continue to protect the most vulnerable people in our country during this national emergency.

John Herriman, Chief Executive of the National Emergencies Trust, said:

“This is very welcome money that builds on the success of the NET Coronavirus appeal to date and which will give thousands and thousands of people real and much needed help. By working collaboratively with many local grassroots charities and local community foundations we have been able to deliver support quickly, fairly and efficiently to those who need it most. We have seen many, many stories of people who have already received wonderful support, from food deliveries to helping those in isolation. This additional funding means we can do so much more, and we will work in partnership with the sector to ensure support continues to get to where it’s needed most.”

Dawn Austwick OBE, Chief Executive, National Lottery Community Fund, said:

“I’ve been inspired by how charities and voluntary groups have stepped up to support people and communities through this crisis. So this support from Government is welcome, we look forward to working alongside Government and others to ensure these new funds have the biggest possible impact in communities.”

Ruth Davison, Chief Executive of Comic Relief, said:

“The incredible support for the Big Night In means we will be able to provide vital funding to smaller charities across the UK who are working around the clock to help keep people fed, safe and supported throughout the pandemic.”

Sir John Low, Chief Executive of the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF), said:

The Charities Aid Foundation knows only too well that charities on the front line are facing incredible demands for their services just as income is squeezed. This set of measures from the Treasury will offer important and welcome support for civil society at this very difficult time for us all.

Recognising the humbling generosity of the British public right now is so vital as we rally together in the face of such a national challenge.

Charities at the front line and all those working to support our society need help to perform their vital function bringing people together at this time of enormous challenge.

Cardinal Bertone. The U.K. side was headed by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the Rt. Hon William Hague, M.P. Those present included a number of senior British government ministers and senior officials from the Holy See. The discussion covered a range of areas of shared interest between the UK government and the Holy See.

Her Majesty’s Government and the Holy See share a commitment to bringing an end to poverty and underdevelopment. On the eve of a summit in New York to review progress towards implementing the Millennium Development Goals, they share the conviction that more needs to be done to address the unnecessary suffering caused by hunger, disease and illiteracy. Strong political leadership and respect for the ethos of local communities are necessary in the promotion of the right to life, food, health and development for all.

The British government and the Holy See share a conviction of the urgent need for action to address the challenge of climate change. Action is needed  at every level from the governmental to the individual  if we are to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to set in motion the transition to a global low-carbon economy, and to assist poor and vulnerable countries to adapt to the impacts of climate change that are already inevitable.

There was a good exchange of views on a variety of social and economic issues, recognising the role played by faith in the lives of individuals and as part of the fabric of a strong, generous, tolerant society.

The visit of Pope Benedict XVI provided the opportunity to develop a deeper exchange of views between the Holy See and the UK government.  Tonight’s discussion provided a useful basis for both sides to continue to pursue initiatives and discussions on areas of common interest to the UK and the Holy See.",Commitment to bringing an end to poverty and underdevelopment,Welfare,,id25_591

The first-of-its-kind hotline is part of a two-year £8.55 million programme to fulfil the government’s pledge to end veteran rough sleeping. The Veterans’ Strategy Action Plan 2022-24 sets out the intention to achieve this within the current Parliament, but thanks to new funding this is set to be achieved ahead of schedule.

Run by social housing provider Riverside Group, the £500,000 housing hotline will give homeless veterans a single point of contact to get them the help they need. Op FORTITUDE staff will refer callers to a network of support, including housing providers, charities and local authorities.

Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, Rt Hon. Johnny Mercer MP, said:

Everyone deserves a place they can call home, not least those who have served their country. Today’s launch is a huge milestone in ending veteran homelessness and a clear demonstration of this government delivering on its promises.

There is a lot of great work being done across the country to help veterans get the right level of support. Op FORTITUDE is about bringing all of this together, so any veteran has a clear pathway to get local and customised care.

Transitioning from the armed forces remains a challenge for some. The programme has been designed to support 1,300 vulnerable veterans over two years across almost 60 housing complexes, ranging from apartment blocks to shared houses.

Projects by nine housing providers will target difficult problems so that veterans can get back on their feet and thrive in civilian life. Wraparound services include specialist medical care, connections with local communities and the tools they need to get jobs.

All nine projects will be ready to take Op FORTITUDE referrals by September, expanding the pathway’s network of housing providers from 10 to 14. This includes plugging into a network of 650 homes across Scotland with Veteran Homes Scotland, as well as a brand new consortium of housing across the North West of England.

Minister for Housing and Homelessness, Felicity Buchan, said:

Councils have a duty to ensure everyone has a roof over their head, especially veterans who are rightly given priority for accommodation. “We are already giving councils £2bn over three years to end homelessness and this vital new initiative will help us deliver on our mission.

Lee Buss-Blair, Operations Director, Riverside Group said:

Riverside are honoured to be the organisation chosen to deliver the Op FORTITUDE pathway. Its mission, to end veteran homelessness, is one that we are extremely passionate about.

Every veteran, including the most vulnerable, has the potential to make a positive contribution to their communities if given the right support. Ultimately our goal is to ensure that these veterans receive this support and can go on to fulfil their potential.

This is the first initiative designed to end veteran homelessness, and while the task is a big one, we think that the levels of veteran rough sleeping are such that it is one that we believe can be achieved with collaboration across many sectors.

To further support veterans in securing housing, the Office for Veterans’ Affairs has published guidance on gov.uk. This guide sets out the housing options and support available to veterans, service leavers and their families in England, including routes into both veteran-specific and civilian housing.

The guide can also be used by providers of housing and housing support services to determine the most appropriate course of action.

In the 2023 Spring Budget, the Office for Veterans’ Affairs secured £20 million for a Veterans Housing Capital Fund. The money will go towards providing extra housing for veterans through the development of new builds and the refurbishment of social and charitable housing for veterans.

“There are still many things that we do not know, including the level of demand we will be faced with. But Op FORTITUDE is an opportunity for us to develop a clear picture of the level of need which will support us to make sure that the veteran sector is structured to be able to effectively respond.”",Op FORTITUDE hotline and associated referral pathway,Administrative,Informational,id25_592

He praised the efforts of twelve people, including eight young cadets from across Mid Glamorgan, at his awards ceremony held at Pontypridd Army Reserve Centre on Thursday, 26 January 2023.

He said the Cadet Forces, which included a mixture of military training, youth work, civilian qualifications and community work, helped develop young people to be ready to take their place in society.

“The Cadet Forces would not operate but for the superb dedication and commitment of the officers and adult volunteers who give up their free time to make these organisations work,” said Professor Vaughan.

Able Cadet Brandon Jones of Rhondda Sea Cadet Corps; Able Cadet Anna-Maria Petter of Porthcawl Sea Cadet Corps, Cadet Flight Sergeant Scott Jones of No 3 Welsh Wing RAF Air Cadets; Cadet Flight Sergeant Emily Richards of No 1 Welsh Wing RAF Air Cadets and Cadet Corporal Casey Garland of Cardiff and Vale Combined Cadet Forces were appointed as Lord-Lieutenant cadets for Mid Glamorgan for 2023.

Brandon, 16, from Tonypandy, who aspires to join the Royal Navy, was delighted to form part of the cadet honour guard for the King’s first visit to Cardiff.

Anna-Maria, 16, from Bridgend, who attends Cardiff and Vale College is a keen musician who hopes to study music performance in the future. Her favourite activity is rowing and her greatest achievement in cadets was spending a week on board TS Royalist last year.

Scott, 17, who attends Bryntirion Comprehensive School in Bridgend, has been described as having ‘outstanding leadership’ skills and was awarded the Junior Cadet of the Year Award within his first 12 months. He oversees the Recruit Training Flight which now stands at over twenty cadets. He aspires to become an engineer either within the RAF or British Airways.

Emily, 17, of Merthyr, also attends Cardiff and Vale College, and aspires to become an engineer in the aerospace sector of the military. Among her achievements in cadets so far include flying in a Merlin helicopter and receiving a certificate of good service from the Air Commodore.

Casey, 17, from Aberdare, who attends Cardiff and Vale College, who travels 50 miles every week by public transport to attend cadets, says her greatest achievement so far was representing cadets at the King’s first visit to Cardiff Castle.

The five were selected for the prestigious Lord-Lieutenant’s cadet role after being put forward for nomination by cadet group leaders and the Reserve Forces’ and Cadets’ Association for Wales.

They will follow in the footsteps of Cadet David Morgan of Porthcawl Sea Corps; Cadet Corporal Nyah Pope of Dyfed and Glamorgan Army Cadet Force; Cadet Flight Sergeant Garyn Kiff of No 1 Welsh Wing RAF Air Cadets and Cadet Flight Sergeant Corey Luke of No 3 Welsh Wing RAF Air Cadets who were awarded the Mid Glamorgan Lord-Lieutenant Certificate and Badge for being the 2022 representatives.

The role of Lord-Lieutenant cadet includes attendance with the Lord-Lieutenant, who acts as the King’s representative, at a number of official engagements, including Remembrance events, Royal visits and parades.

Three adults were also recognised for their outstanding service and devotion to duty and awarded the Lord-Lieutenant’s Certificate of Merit.

They were Civilian Instructor Michelle Sussex of No 1 Welsh Wing RAF Air Cadets, Sergeant Stephen Hughes of 3rd Battalion The Royal Welsh and Acting Lance Corporal Rebecca Comer of Wales Universities Officers’ Training Corps.

Michelle from Merthyr Tydfil joined the civilian committee of 415 Merthyr Tydfil Squadron when her son joined as a cadet and within a few years was encouraged to become a Civilian Instructor and is currently the squadron and detached flight adjutant – an integral and exceptional member of the team.

Reservist Rebecca from Bridgend was an officer cadet with Wales UOTC during her time at university. Following university as part of Wales UOTC she was mobilised into Joint Military Command Wales in support of Operation Rescript during the pandemic, where she worked as part of the operations room team. Outside of her reservist work Rebecca is a police officer.

Reservist Stephen from Pontypridd works as a recruiter within 3rd Battalion The Royal Welsh and  has constantly over many years exceeded the recruiting quotas set and as such his success has led to him being employed three days a week. He keeps in touch with recruits in his own time to ensure they are informed and derives great satisfaction from helping others to become members of the Armed Forces.

There are nearly 5,000 cadets in Wales who gain skills and qualifications through working with local communities, charities and taking part in a variety of practical activities. The cadet syllabus is delivered by 1,500 volunteering adult instructors and civilian assistants, who give up their spare time on weeknights and weekends.

The awards ceremony, attended by around 80 people, was organised by the Reserve Forces’ and Cadets’ Association for Wales – an organisation that has supported the Armed Forces for over 100 years.",Recognition and Awards Ceremony,Other,,id25_593

The scheme,launched by the Government in March, provides separating couples with a £500 voucher for mediation services with the aim of finding amicable solutions to their disagreements and freeing up space in the family courts. It seeks to spare them the trauma of going through often lengthy and costly courtroom battles, which can have a damaging impact on children. Normally each mediation session is charged for unless one of the parties has access to legal aid.

Hundreds of people have already accessed this vital support with around 130 vouchers currently being used every week. Early data from the Family Mediation Council (FMC), who run the programme, has shown that up to three-quarters of participants have been helped to reach full or partial agreement on their dispute.

Ministers are determined to build on this success and have today confirmed an additional £800,000 will go towards the scheme – almost doubling an initial £1 million investment made earlier this year and helping around 2,000 more families.

Courts Minister, Lord Wolfson QC said:

Hundreds of separating couples have already benefitted from this scheme – resolving their disputes without the need for an often lengthy, costly and emotionally taxing court process.

This additional funding will allow even more families to access these services, while helping to lessen the pressure on our family courts as we build back better from the pandemic.

Mediation is often a quicker and cheaper way of resolving disputes, which can spare families the stress of attending court and the impact this can have on children. It involves couples working through their differences - led by a trained and accredited mediator – to reach agreements they are both prepared to accept, such as how to split assets or arranging child contact times, rather than have a judge decide for them. They can then ask a court to consider their agreement and make it into a legally binding and enforceable court order.

In one case, the parents of a three year old boy were able to avoid days in court by using the scheme to agree on future arrangements. Both mum and dad were mistrusting of each other and sceptical about mediation. The scheme helped them to move forward and their child now has parents who can talk to one another about his best interests with healthier relationships all around.

Jane Kerr, anFMCAccredited mediator, said of the scheme:

The mediation voucher scheme has been invaluable in providing clients with access to mediation at a time when money is tight and finances are feeling fraught. I have worked with several couples who were interested in the benefits mediation offered, however were not financially in a position to get started.

Two cases I have worked on over the last few months have concluded successfully with positive progress and outcomes for their children. They were clear examples of families who were in crisis, amid messy separations and who left mediation on a firmer footing with regards to their co-parenting relationship and having worked out practical arrangements.

The scheme is eligible for families seeking to resolve private law or financial matters relating to children – for example, child arrangement orders or financial disputes regarding a child’s upbringing.

If a case is eligible for vouchers, the mediator will automatically claim back the contributions from the Government.

The new investment in the scheme follows aCall for Evidence on dispute resolution, launched earlier this month, on the best ways to settle family, business and other civil disputes away from the courtroom.

The move forms part of recent action by the Government to help reduce family conflict, includingintroducing new laws to spare divorcing couples the need to apportion blamefor the breakdown of their marriage..

Today’s announcement also follows a major overhaul of the family courts announced last year to better protect victims of domestic abuse, including an automatic entitlement for special measures in courtrooms and stronger powers for judges to stop abusers repeatedly dragging their victims to court.

TheClean Maritime Demonstration Competition, announced as part of thePrime Minister’s 10 point plan for green industrial revolution, is supporting the development of innovative technology to propel the government’s commitment to have zero emission ships operating commercially by 2025 – creating hundreds of highly skilled jobs across the nation and establishing the UK as world leaders in clean maritime.

A fully automated net positive submarine fleet, powered entirely on green hydrogen, could help cleanse the oceans of toxic pollution by collecting microplastics on its pilot route between Glasgow and Belfast. While transporting cargo shipments, the fleet could secure significant emission savings of 27 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the first year of operation, with an overall mission to reduce 300 million tonnes ofCO2emissions as the fleet grows.

Also among the winners is an all-electric charge-point connected to an offshore wind turbine. The charge-points will be able to power boats using 100% renewable energy generated from the turbine. This offers potential savings of up to 131,100 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions a year – the equivalent of removing over 62,000 cars from our roads.

Similar to roadside electric vehicle chargepoints, these will be operated by semi-automated control, meaning that sailors can moor up by the wind turbine chargepoint, plug in, charge up, then sail on.

Announcing the winners in Greenwich, the heart of British maritime, on the state-of-the-art Royal Navy ship, HMS Albion, the Transport Secretary outlined how this is the latest in a string of government initiatives aimed at cutting emissions in the sector as part of London International Shipping Week – including joining other nations in supporting a world-leading absolute zero target for international shipping emissions by 2050.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said:

As a proud island nation built on our maritime prowess, it is only right that we lead by example when it comes to decarbonising the sector and building back greener.

The projects announced today showcase the best of British innovation, revolutionising existing technology and infrastructure to slash emissions, create jobs and get us another step closer to our decarbonisation targets.

This comes as Maritime Minister Robert Courts supports the opening of the UK’s greenest cruise terminal. The Horizon Cruise Terminal at the Port of Southampton, Europe’s leading cruise turnaround port, is the first of its kind, using an innovative mix of solar panel roofing and clean energy shore power plug-in charging for ships – pioneering the way towards greener cruising.

Maritime Minister Robert Courts said:

As the cruising sector bounces back from the pandemic, it’s important that our environmental commitments are at the heart of everything we do.

Building state-of-the-art green infrastructure at cruise terminals helps us move towards cleaner cruising, creating more spaces for these ships to dock and putting us on track to hit net zero by 2050.

Maritime UK chair Sarah Kenny said:

We have always been an island of maritime pioneers and today’s competition shows this will long continue with potential to rule the green waves of the future.

Through increased investment and closer collaboration with government our industry can rise to the challenge of steering the UK’s vessels in a green direction.

We still have a very long way to go, but today marks an important step towards our journey to net zero.

Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Oceanways, Dhruv Boruah, said:

We would like to thank our Transport Secretary Grant Shapps MP for selecting Oceanways to support the Department for Transport’s mission to decarbonise shipping and aid our Prime Minister’s commitment to build back better. Time is running out and it is imperative we don’t settle for 1% more efficiency in an existing system, but instead, radically rethink to create innovative solutions.

It’s not just #JetZero. Oceanways has assembled a world-class team to pioneer #SubZero by creating the new market of net positive underwater transport systems with zero-emission cargo submarines as an innovative tool to decarbonise shipping and clean up our ocean.

Paul Cairns, Managing Director of MJR Power & Automation, said:

We are delighted to have been selected as one of the winners of the Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition, which will enable us to demonstrate our world-leading technology for offshore charging of vessels, and our commitment to supporting decarbonisation of marine operations.

The support ofDfTandInnovateUKis crucial to delivering net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and we are proud to be recipients of their support.

Simon Edmonds, Deputy Executive Chair and Chief Business Officer, Innovate UK, said:

As the UK prepares to host COP26 in the maritime city of Glasgow, it is great that we can announce funding for these fantastic projects in the marine sector that will help the UK meet its net zero goals.

From this competition we saw a very high level of demand, we have seen the very best of British ideas from all over the country. It is clear that not only does the UK have a great maritime history, but also a bright and greener future, too.

The initiatives follow on from the government’s previous commitments outlined in the world-leadingTransport decarbonisation planto explore the establishment of a dedicated function for creating zero-emission shipbuilding andR&Dfor autonomous vessel sailings under the function of UK Shore.

Based inDfT, UK Shore will unlock the necessary industry investment in clean maritime technologies, tackling supply- and demand-side barriers, as well as developing infrastructure and consumer confidence in clean maritime technologies.

Well thank you very much for that introduction and it really is great to be here at this fabulous university that does a fantastic job as a university, but also is the headquarters for Team GB.  And I don’t know about all of you but I really feel that the pace is quickening, the sense of excitement is growing.  That sense of anticipation about what is going to come is really beginning to hit me.

I think the whole country is beginning to really feel that sense of excitement and the next few weeks are going to be simply amazing.  We are going to remember them all of our lives and our children will certainly remember them too.  These are four weeks in a British summer that are going to be like no other four weeks in a British summer.  They will be about  making the most of our country, being everything it can be and being at the centre of the world’s attention.

I think there is a lot to be proud of when it comes to these Olympic and Paralympic Games.  The bidding team and the last Government did a great job winning them for Britain and a great job getting them off the ground.  The Government I lead picked up the baton and I think has kept up the pace.  But of course there is another team that matters far more right now.

Later today I’m going to be seeing members of Team GB.  Their dedication is humbling.  I’ve already had the privilege of seeing some of them train.  But what I think counts is not just their immense skill, but that incredible commitment: putting in the effort day in, day out, carrying the torch for Britain - and winning.  And before anything else I want to thank every one of them for their efforts.  I know they will do us proud.  I’ll be cheering Team GB on all the way and I know the whole country and everyone in this hall will be too.

So, I think, we are all set for what should be an outstanding Games.  And along the way there have been all sorts of challenges to overcome.  When you think back to that moment in 2005 when we all cheered the success of London’s bid, there was that immense sense of pride.  But there was also some anxiety.  Would they be worth it?  Would the venues be completed on time?  Would the public really get onboard with the Games?  I think most of all, people were asking, would the Games bring the whole nation together and not just be a festival for London?

I’m not saying there are not big challenges to meet in the remaining days.  But predominantly the answer to all those questions I just posed, I think, is a resounding ‘yes’.

The Olympic Park is ready and it looks absolutely stunning.  The teams are arriving.  Our Games are on time and under budget and we are going to keep it that way.  And they are reaching all parts of our country with 37 Games venues and 200 training camps across every part of Britain.  And just look at the brilliant success of the Olympic Torch relay.  I think it really says something extraordinary about Britain.  Huge crowds, everywhere - like here in Loughborough, two days ago - already getting on for seven million people, more than anyone expected, have stood in the sun but mainly in the rain to cheer on their local heroes, the doers and the givers in society.

Think of that incredibly moving scene in Doncaster last week, when Lance Bombardier Ben Parkinson defied his terrible injuries inflicted in conflict to carry the torch through the streets of his own hometown.  The Torch has shown the Games are not just about London, or England.  Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all really embraced the torch relay and the Games.  There have been incredibly moving scenes and I think the whole United Kingdom has pulled together.

Of course, there’s still more to get right as the Games start.  There are going to be hiccups, there will be last minute worries and last minute challenges to overcome.  However well prepared we are, some things will come as a surprise.  For example, the crowds and strain on our transport system, for which we will all have to make allowances.  So we have got to be prepared for everything.

But now isn’t the moment to talk things down.  It’s a great trait in our national character that we can be quite self-deprecating but I think there’s no need to think that anyone - or any country - could have done these Games better.  We are doing these Games brilliantly and we are doing them in Britain and we should be proud of that.

So now we need to go beyond the question, ‘Can we stage an outstanding Olympics and Paralympics?’ because I believe we can and we will.  Instead we have to start answering the next question that matters just as much, which is, ‘How do we make the most of the Games?’  Not just in terms of medals won and visitors given a warm welcome, vital as those things are, but how much can we do in making the momentum of these Games last.  That, I think, is the biggest challenge ahead of us now.

For me, that vision is about buildings, it’s about people, it’s about sport, it’s about the economy, it’s about legacy, it’s about inspiration for the future - and frankly I want us to break records on every single one of them.

So let’s start with the things we are building and the places that we are creating.  Our inspiration should be the Great Exhibition of 1851, when the personal drive of one man, Prince Albert, created South Kensington - a new quarter of our capital that became a home to art, to science and to technology.  London 2012 needs to match that - and I believe it will.

When our bid won, we promised to use the Games to transform a derelict part of east London and to leave the city with better transport, new homes and busy venues.  Now, already, the benefits have been huge.  46,000 people worked on the Olympic Park during construction.  UK-based companies have won more than £6.5 billion worth of contracts.  And 75% of every pound spent on Olympic construction has gone towards regeneration.

Unlike many past Games, there’s no last minute panic with the paintbrush and we can concentrate on what comes next.  I don’t think any other Games before has ever prepared for the future quite like this.  Thanks to the work of two governments, the Games organisers and the Mayors, six of the eight major venues have operators ready for after the Games and the other two will follow this year.

This is important; it is not some distant prospect.  The first venues, having been used for the Olympics, will open to the public in 2013, helping create an estimated 10,000 extra jobs at the Park alone.  Take one example, the Aquatic Centre, which I have been to see myself: incredibly impressive.  We expect that to be used by 800,000 people a year after the Games - everyone from local families to our best sporting talent.  It is an incredible piece of physical legacy that we will really benefit from as a country.  And with a mix of permanent and temporary facilities that we’ve chosen, we will only be left with what we can use.  We really meant it when we said no white elephants.

But I wouldn’t be happy if all the Games left us could be summed up in steel and concrete.  When I talk about what the Games can do for Britain, I don’t just mean the physical structures that can be left behind.  I also mean the chance to strengthen our society, to give people a way to help others.  And our inspiration for that should perhaps be the Olympics of 1948 and the Stoke Mandeville Games that were held alongside.  A moment when the world came together after war and those who had been wounded proved that disability was no barrier to success.  And which led to the Paralympics, the second-largest sporting event on earth and another incredible part of this summer.

The lasting benefits of London 2012 can be just as great.  Already from Jubilee street parties to the Olympic Torch, this summer has unlocked a spirit of sharing that some thought might have gone for good.  When the organisers of London 2012 asked people to volunteer, an incredible number went ahead: almost a quarter of a million people put their names forward.  Of those 70,000 people - 70,000 people - have been chosen, contributing 8 million hours of volunteering.  On top of that, 8,000 Londoners have signed up to be Ambassadors welcoming visitors to the city and 15,000 local leaders are helping communities celebrate the Games.  That is people from right across the country, giving their time for free.  Without them London 2012 would simply not be possible.

And the point is this: if we can do this during the Games, why can’t we keep doing it for our society when they are over?  Not government telling people what to do - that won’t work - but the Games inspiring communities to do things to help themselves.It starts next month, the weekend after the Games end when the Join In Trust is aiming to get as many sports clubs as possible to open their doors to invite people to take part and volunteer.  Already, in just over a month, more than 1,000 events have signed up.

And that leads to one area in particular where the Olympic spirit of taking part can make a real difference to young people.  And that is school sport and helping to drive participation in sport itself.  Sustaining the momentum of the Games means opening people’s eyes to the possibility of sport.  Getting young people to follow their heroes and to take part and to get schools to take part as well and to make sure that this includes local clubs.

Our inspiration here can be London’s first Olympics of 1908, which saw the Games blossom in their modern form as rules were written, teams competed in a purpose-built stadium and paraded under their national flags for the first time helping sport become something that could be shared by everyone.  Some of the barriers that hold young people back are in their minds, about imagined barriers of aspiration and confidence.  The Olympics are a chance to break them down.

I’m not claiming that one Olympics will turn every child into tomorrow’s Mo Farah or Victoria Pendleton.  But just look where our great athletes have come from.  Seb Coe started running with the Hallamshire Harriers.  Amir Khan started boxing at Bury ABC.  Sport can really change lives.

So why is it that in so many schools, sport has been squeezed out and facilities run down?  The result is that in too many cases it’s independent schools producing more than their fair share of medal winners and too many children thinking taking part in sport just isn’t for them.

We’ve got to change that.  So we’re putting £1 billion into youth sport, including a massive expansion of after-school clubs for children who don’t think sport is for them.  Already, we’ve got 3,000 secondary and 4,500 primary sports clubs underway and I want to see 13,500 by 2015.

It’s not just about helping young people develop a sporting habit for life.  We’ve got to nurture the best talents for the future too.  I think it’s fantastic that more than 14,000 schools signed up to the Olympic-style School Games programme in its first year - that was from a standing start to a huge number of schools, 14,000 - and that 1,600 of our best young athletes took part in the inaugural School Games finals at the Olympic Park a couple of months ago.  I want to see that competition grow, I want to see it become a fixture in the lives of young people in our country.

Now there’s a further reason why the Games have got to be great for Britain, too.  They should be great for our economy.  We shouldn’t see them - and this is really vital - we shouldn’t see them as some sort of expensive luxury in tough times.  Because in my view it’s precisely because times are tough that we have got to get everything we can out of these Games to support jobs and to support growth in the economy.

And that is my personal mission for London 2012.  Because we have built the solid foundations for a successful Games, we are able to focus our efforts on making sure they’re a real boost for Britain.  That is what I’m going to be devoting my energy to: making sure that we turn these Games into gold for Britain.  Our inspiration here perhaps should be the Festival of Britain 1951, which was a showcase of national enterprise and innovation.  Now, as then, we really need to drum up business for Britain.  We need to sell Britain to the world on the back of British success.

No other country in the world has the chance to put on this show and to profit from it in the next few years like we do.  That’s why during the Games I’m hosting a Global Investment Conference and 17 Global Business Summits.  They will bring British businesses together with potential investors and trading partners from around the world.  I expect to see benefits to the British economy of over £1 billion.  I am confident that we can derive over £13 billion of benefit to the UK economy over the next four years as a result of hosting these Games.

I am certain that when you add in the benefits from construction the total gain will be even greater.  For instance, a study by Lloyds Bank published this week found the Games will contribute £16.5 billion to the economy by 2017.  Put that another way, that is more than the cost of holding the Games in the first place.  Already firms here in the East Midlands have won contracts for £360 million.

It’s great to see Sir John Armitt here today, and I’d like to personally congratulate him for all the work that he’s done to deliver such a superb set of stadia and Games.  Thank you very much.  As you say, John, in your report today, it is vital that we don’t allow the rules on Olympic marketing to block companies from making the most of that success.  So we’re working with the British Olympic Association and the IOC to make sure that Olympic marketing rules don’t get in the way.

It’s through things like this that the Games can help to ignite that vital spark of enterprise, helped too by things like StartUp Loans, nurturing the next generation of British business and today backed by Regus, who are offering help to 30,000 young entrepreneurs by giving them office space for free to help start their businesses.

We’ve already said that we can expect the Games to boost tourism to the UK, bringing in more than 4.5 million extra visitors and that’s £2.3 billion worth of spending over the next four years.  That alone will contribute to the creation of an extra 70,000 new jobs.

It will also, I believe, lead to a better reputation for Britain.  As part of the run-in to London 2012, we launched the GREAT campaign and I hope you’ve all seen the posters and the advertisements not just here, but being broadcast from all over the world.  From the sides of buses in Berlin to skyscrapers in Sydney, we’ve been pushing the message that Britain is a great place to visit, a great place to come and do business.  I believe it is working, and there’s no reason to stop so we’re going to keep it going after the Games have finished.

So this summer is going to be obviously a magnificent sporting event.  We’re going to be celebrating the medals, the heroes, the heroines.  It will be inspirational.  But we’ve got to make sure that these are the inspirational Games for the future.  Really making the most of them, we have got to make sure this inspiration is about more than a one-off, one summer wonder.

It can be so much more.  It can be one of those really special moments in our national story.  A time that caught the mood.  A time that lifted us.  A time that created something amazing.

So yes, there is an opportunity to regenerate communities, to bring people together as volunteers, to revive school sport and to bring prosperity and jobs to our country.  But the first prize is even more valuable: a national boost to our energy and inspiration, a chance to realise how great we can be and how much we can go on to achieve as a country.  These are Britain’s Games, Britain’s opportunity and Britain’s moment.  We’ve got to make the most of them and I believe that we will.  Thank you.

Thank you very much.  We’ve got time for some questions.

QUESTIONPrime Minister, thank you for acknowledging the benefits that tourism can bring through the way in which the Olympics can move forward.  We’re thrilled that last year we had an increase in spending which increased the number of jobs by 5% and we’re delighted that the Regional Growth Fund has given funds not only to VisitEngland but to other tourism projects.

It would be hugely appreciated if you could actively encourage all those departments who have a part to play in tourism, including the Treasury and Transport, to understand the benefits as you outline them.

PRIME MINISTERThank you.  I take a personal interest in this.  I think I’m the first prime minister to make a full speech dedicated to tourism and putting in place a proper tourism strategy, which I did in my first year in office.  Also I think I’m probably the first prime minister to appoint a tourism minister and keep him there for a serious amount of time.

So I think this is a great opportunity for us.  I took a personal interest in the GREAT campaign and saw all of the creative presentations.  I think it’s a really good campaign because it’s incredibly flexible: you can talk about sport being great; Loughborough being great; our universities being great.  Every part of the United Kingdom can use it and anyone who has any enthusiasm for any part of the United Kingdom can find a way to adapt it.

So I think this is a big opportunity for us.  We had a discussion in Cabinet this week - just to prove that I’m making sure every minister is behind this - we had a discussion in Cabinet this week about the issue of how we get a larger share of Chinese tourism; how do we make our visas simpler; how do we make it more cost-effective; how do we make sure that we compete with all the Schengen countries who offer one visa for more countries than we can offer.

We’re really on this, recognising this is an important industry for Britain.  It’s a very quick industry for turning jobs on and for getting young people trained.  We’re really alert to the opportunities and I think all government ministers, as you say, need to be behind this and they will be.

QUESTIONEverything’s inspirational at the minute, everybody’s got a really good feel factor.  We’ve had the Jubilee, we’ve got Andy Murray, we’ve got the Olympics.

PRIME MINISTERFormula One.

QUESTIONFormula One, absolutely (we’ll be there Saturday, Silverstone’s my area).  And everything is really good.  When you’re having all your summits, please could you keep at the heart - and I know that it’s at the top of your agenda - but really keep at heart the small businesses.

Tourism obviously is a major part of the Federation of Small Businesses but we have an awful lot of really good growing businesses out there that need help just to push them forward.  If you could, keep that really at the centre of things to move the economy on.

PRIME MINISTERI think you’re absolutely right.  Because the truth is everyone knows we need to rebalance our country and our economy.  The public sector’s become too big and the private sector is too small and we need to have a growth of enterprise, business and investment.

I think everybody also knows that, while some of our big companies are absolute world-beaters doing fantastic things, the jobs growth is going to come from the small- and the medium-sized enterprises.  Just two figures for you.  One is that actually last year, 2011, was a record year for the starting of new businesses and we need to get behind them and help them so that they can grow and expand, making it easier for them to take people on.

The other fact is that I think it’s one in five of our SMEs that export.  If we can make that one in four we’d eradicate our trade deficit.  So the agenda of helping SMEs is not just part of the economic strategy, it really is a mainstay of it.  Because without that we won’t get the growth, the jobs, the investment and the rebalanced trading system that we want to see.

QUESTIONYou mentioned earlier Sebastian Coe’s time with the Hallamshire Harriers and one of his favourite runs was around Chatsworth in the Peak District National Park.  We’re very keen this year to make our contribution to the GREAT campaign and to the long-term ways of encouraging people to take part in outdoor activities.  Great opportunities in Britain across Dartmoor, Exmoor, the Cairngorms and of course the Peak District.  Walking, climbing, cycling and a lot of other quite low-cost activities, again, for our times.  So we’re very keen to work with all of the departments on that agenda.  Thank you.

PRIME MINISTERWell you’ve got Penny Cobham from VisitEngland here.  I’ve long believed that we undersell our country in terms of tourism.  I think if you asked Americans, Japanese, Canadians they’d know that Scotland has got beautiful wilderness to go and walk in and enjoy but I don’t think they do know about the Peak District National Park, the South West Coast Path or some of the other incredible pieces of natural England that we have.  And also natural Wales and natural Northern Ireland, so I’m not accused of any bias here.

The strength of the GREAT campaign is that it enables every part of the country to use what it thinks is great about its part of the country to market to others.  So it’s very, very flexible but with a really good, clear message.

QUESTIONPrime Minister, I just wanted to say a personal thank you to the Olympic Delivery Authority and Sir John Armitt who came to visit our factory.  All I can confirm is that it did make a difference.  It maintained a level of workforce - and we’re a very small company in Derby - it made a great difference to us during the times of recession.  And our legacy is that we’re going to get the chance when the Games are finished to use our products and use the Games’ facilities as a wonderful showcase for what I consider to be breathtaking construction.

PRIME MINISTERFantastic.  Well, as I say, I think it’s unfair to single someone out but when you’re Prime Minister the thing you worry about most is whether it is going to be ready: the swimming pool is not going to be full of water, and the stadium won’t be finished.  And I think it’s been a remarkable construction and organisational feat.

I think it’s very important you’re able to market your success here elsewhere.  We want you out in Sochi, we want you out in Rio.  It’s not just Olympics:  there are so many sporting events around the world that I think will now need British help and expertise.

I also believe it’s been a good learning experience for us as a country.  One of the things I saw recently was what’s happening at Crossrail which, now the Olympics is done, is the biggest construction project anywhere in Europe.  And I think Crossrail has really learned from seeing how the Olympics got going with the training providers to make sure we could get more British people trained and working on the construction site.  Crossrail wanted to do that from the off, and I think they are doing that.

So, there is a lot for us to learn nationally and a lot for us to sell internationally.

QUESTIONThank you Prime Minister, an inspirational speech particularly around tourism.  How do you feel the Olympic legacy can specifically support driving improved levels of youth employment and apprenticeships in this country?

PRIME MINISTERAs I was saying, I think that part of the learning experience of the Olympics was how do you do more when you have big construction projects to make sure that you do not just immediately suck in labour from everywhere else but work with the training providers.

If you have a big project and you have a lot of work underway, you should be able to predict a bit more what skills you are going to need and at what stages you will need them at.  You can use that to work with the training providers and with local colleges to make sure you have a good passage of young people coming through and working on the site.

I have met some of the apprentices on the Olympics site and some of them have now been there for two, three or four years.  I think that is a really important part of what we do and what we have learnt.

I think the Government has to take lessons from that forward to think about how we get businesses to work even more closely with local colleges; how we make sure that the qualifications that we provide are really worthwhile and what young people want.

I think another big lesson is what we teach in schools.  I think, frankly, we have not been very good as a country in explaining the different pathways and options to young people in schools.

There is a very clear pathway to university: you take your A-levels, you fill in your UCAS form, and you go to university.  Everyone understands that.  The pathway for vocational training and apprenticeships has been much more confusing.

I have been struck by how many times over the last two years I have met people who have done a university course or part of a university course and then have gone into an apprenticeship.  When I have asked them, ‘What information did you get at school?’ they say, ‘Well we didn’t really get the proper guidance about what was available’.

So I think there is a culture change that needs to happen in the country and that needs to be helped by better explanation in our schools about what is available.

Of course the point we need to make is that an apprenticeship can lead to a university degree.  If you look at the board of Rolls Royce, half the people on it were apprentices.  So, this idea that one is high-grade and the other one is not is completely wrong.

QUESTIONPrime Minister, a sporting question: athletes across sport have improved immensely in their professionalisation, as we have enjoyed the support of your government and the previous government in supporting high performance athletes.  Do you see that continuing into Rio and beyond?  I should add that the support that we have had from many agencies, UK Sport and your government ministers has been quite outstanding and for which we are very grateful indeed.

PRIME MINISTERWell, thank you.  It was one of the early decisions I recall we had to make.  I am not blaming the last government, but they started off a very strong programme of funding elite sport but they had not, as it were, filled in the numbers for the years 2011 and 2012.  We had to find the money and fill in those years.

It would have been terrible to have stopped high funding levels for elite sport before the Olympics.  All I can say is that you have a very talented team of ministers in that department; they fight extremely hard for the funding that they need for sport as an important part of their department.

We are obviously going to go through a spending review all over again for the next spending period but I know that they will stand up and fight very hard for a good share.  What I hope the Olympics will show is that this is a very good investment; it not only, we hope, helps us to bring medals and brings us a sense of national pride; it inspires young people; it means more sport at school; it has all sorts of pull through effects.

It is often said when we do well at cycling, we sell more bicycles; when we do well at swimming, suddenly the swimwear is all sold out.  There is no doubt that what happens on the screen has an enormous effect on young people.

I often say this, politicians want to change the world; we have certain tools at our disposal: we make laws, we spend money, we issue press releases, we announce policies, and we make regulations.  But so often if you want to change the world, role models and inspiration can change far more than governments are able to change.

That is what we must hope about this Olympics, that the things people are going to see are going to inspire people to do great things.  Not only in sport, but as I have argued also in volunteering and playing a bigger role in society.  That is what it is about.

I think, without prejudging the spending review, the ministers in the Department of Culture, Media and Sport,  The Treasury will suck on their pencils and the First Lord of the Treasury eventually will have to step in and decide.  But I think they have a good argument to make.

Can I thank you all very much for coming?  Can I thank Loughborough for this wonderful setting?  I can see you have planned for both sorts of weather here, but it is immensely impressive and I am now very much looking forward to meeting some members of Team GB.

The 32 reports draw on nearly 2300 pieces of written evidence which together demonstrate why the EU needs ambitious reform to make it more open, competitive, flexible and democratically accountable, for the benefit of everyone in Europe.

The final reports in the series cover: economic and monetary policy; police and criminal justice; information rights; education, vocational training and youth; enlargement; voting, consular and statistics; and subsidiarity and proportionality.

Welcoming the conclusion of the review, the Foreign Secretary, Phillip Hammond, said:

This two-year review to examine the impact of EU membership on the UK is unprecedented in its size and scale. Many themes that have emerged chime with priorities that the UK and European partners have pressed the Commission to pursue.  In particular, they underline the need for the EU to focus on those areas where it genuinely adds value, alongside pursuing an ambitious reform agenda for the benefit of all 28 Member States. There are many areas where action can and should be taken in Member States rather than at the EU level.

The review provides a wealth of material that anyone interested in reform can draw upon and the 32 reports provide evidence about every area of EU activity, allowing people to judge for themselves how the current arrangements are working. These reports provide further evidence of the need for a change in Britain’s relationship with the EU.

The 7 new reports were produced after extensive consultation with a wide range of interested parties in the UK and beyond, including businesses, professional bodies and representative organisations, civil society organisations, think tanks, academics and members of the public.

The final reports pick up on a number of themes which recur across the review:

strategy aims to tackle increasing threats to gender equality from climate change, humanitarian crises, conflicts such as the war in Ukraine, and recent attempts to roll back women’s rights, including in countries like Iran and Afghanistan

the Foreign Secretary also announces a new emphasis on supporting grassroots women’s rights organisations, and funding for a Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights programme that will support an estimated 10 million women

Women and girls will be put at the heart of the UK’s international work, with a new strategy that will tackle gender inequality across the globe.

Launching on International Women’s Day,the new strategywill set out how the UK will work to tackle global gender inequality at every opportunity, including combatting attempts to roll back women’s rights, and work with partners around the world to do the same. For the first time, this strategy commits the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office to more than 80% of its bilateral aid programmes including a focus on gender equality by 2030.

Progress towards gender equality is increasingly under threat. Climate change and humanitarian crises continue to disproportionately affect women and girls, there are attempts to row back on women’s rights including in countries like Iran and Afghanistan, sexual violence is happening in conflicts in Ukraine and elsewhere and violence against women is growing online.

Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said:

Advancing gender equality and challenging discrimination is obviously the right thing to do, but it also brings freedom, boosts prosperity and trade, and strengthens security – it is the fundamental building block of all healthy democracies.

Our investment to date has improved lives around the world, with more girls in school, fewer forced into early marriage and more women in top political and leadership roles.

But these hard-won gains are now under increasing threat. We’re ramping up our work to tackle the inequalities which remain, at every opportunity.

The Foreign Secretary will launch the new strategy in Sierra Leone, where he is visiting a school and a hospital in his mother’s hometown of Bo, to see how UK-funded projects are having a positive impact on women and girls.

In the hospital, he will see how UK support is improving blood banks and equipment, increasing electricity access and saving the lives of pregnant women. In the school he will hear about girls’ aspirations for the future. The UK is supporting students there to talk about preventing violence.

The strategy puts a continued focus on educating girls, empowering women and girls, championing their health and rights and ending gender-based violence – the challenges the UK believes are most acute.

It commits theFCDOto involving its entire network of high commissions and embassies around the world to deliver the strategy. This will include UK heads of mission developing plans and commitments specific to their host country and raising the most pressing issues with their host governments. The UK will also develop an ambitious new research offer to help the UK and its partners make investment decisions.

Alongside the strategy, the Foreign Secretary will announce a new women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights programme, focused on sub-Saharan Africa, which has some of the highest rates of child marriage and maternal mortality in the world.

Reaching up to 10.4 million women, the programme will receive up to £200 million and is expected to prevent up to 30,600 maternal deaths, 3.4 million unsafe abortions and 9.5 million unintended pregnancies.

Separately, the UK is also increasing support for women’s rights organisations and movements, recognising their critical role in advancing gender equality and protecting rights, and amplifying grassroots women’s and girls’ voices. Most of this £38 million programme will be delivered through a new partnership with the Equality Fund.

Jess Tomlin, co-CEO of the Equality Fund said:

We’re really excited about this partnership because it shows that every sector can come together – with boldness and urgency – to deliver resources to women’s rights organisations everywhere. A just, sustainable, thriving future depends on the solutions of feminist movements, and it’s time for all of us to trust and robustly resource their leadership at scale all across the world.

this is thefirst international Women and Girls Strategythat brings together all the UK’s development and diplomacy work. The Department for International Development (DFID) produced aStrategic Vision for Gender Equality in 2018. This new strategy is broader, reflecting all the work of the merged Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office

theFCDOWomen and Girls Strategy commits that at least 80% ofFCDObilateral Official Development Assistance (ODA) programmes targets gender equality as a policy objective by 2030. We will use the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)Development Assistance Committee (DAC) gender equality policy markerto track this

we are announcing up to £200 million towards the WISH (Women’s Integrated Sexual Health) Dividend Women’s Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights programme, focussed on sub-Saharan Africa

a new £38 million programme will support women’s rights organisations (WROs) and movements around the world. £33 million of this funding is for a new partnership with the Equality Fund. Up to £5 million is going to a consortium led by Gender Links, a South African-based women’s rights organisation

Facebook was a forum in which people were able to express their views and the Prime Minister had expressed his in PMQs. The PMS added that it was possible Facebook would be made aware of the Prime Minister’s comments at official level.

Asked if that would take place imminently, the PMS replied that it was possible that this afternoon we would put a call in to make sure they were aware of the comments. On whether it would be a No10 official, the PMS said he thought it would be.

Put that the Prime Minister had read out the names of British soldiers that had died in Afghanistan for the first time in two weeks and did he now recognise that PMQs was the proper place for such tributes, the PMS said that the Prime Minister read out the names at the earliest possible opportunity when he was in Parliament.

The Prime Minister had made a number of statements recently and had therefore taken the opportunity to read names out at those times.

Asked if there was a change in policy, the PMS said that there was not. The PMS said that this was true under the last Government; it had always been the case that the Prime Minister read out names at the earliest opportunity in the Commons.

Put that the former Prime Minister had always read out the names of soldiers, the PMS said that there had been no change of policy on that point either; the Government could only give out the names of soldiers when it was appropriate to do so.

Put that the Prime Minister had read out excerpts of Peter Mandelson’s book and had he spent a lot of time reading it, the PMS replied that the Prime Minister had seen the reports.

Put that the Prime Minister sounded exasperated when talking about the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), the PMS said that the Prime Minister was making the point that the system as it stood was not working. This was not about the rules, or about the fact that IPSA was independent; it was the way the system was working. It had been an ongoing issue and MPs from all sides had been making their views known.

Asked whether the Prime Minister would accept that the public would not have much sympathy for MPs moaning about a tighter expenses regime, the PMS said that it was not a question of it being a tighter regime; it was right that there should be a system that the public had confidence in and the Prime Minister had made that point in the House.

There was a separate point that the system needed to work, so that MPs could make the claims that they were allowed to.

Put that the Prime Minister had originally endorsed IPSA and what had changed since then, the PMS said that this had been an ongoing issue. There had been problems with the bureaucracy of the system and those problems had not been resolved. The Prime Minister was completely supportive of having an independent statutory body and having a cleaned up expenses system that was transparent and one that the public had confidence in.

Asked if the Prime Minister was concerned that it could look like people were ganging up on IPSA, the PMS replied that the Speaker’s Committee had an oversight role for IPSA.

IPSA was also accountable to the Public Accounts Committee because the NAO had an oversight role and audited IPSA. So there were ways by which IPSA was held to account, as people would expect of a body spending public money.

Asked what the Prime Minister had said to General Richards and what he wanted to see from his appointment, the PMS replied that General Richards did not take up his post for some time, so the current Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) remained in charge.

Asked what the Prime Minister wanted from the appointment, the PMS said that the appointment was made by the Queen, based on a recommendation from the Ministry of Defence. The Prime Minister was consulted on the appointment, which was made on merit.

Put that the Prime Minister had interviewed him, the PMS replied that the Prime Minister had met General Richards on several occasions.

When asked what the Prime Minister’s view was on Sir Jock Stirrup being publicly sacked in the Sunday Times, the PMS said that we had dealt with that in the past. Today’s appointment was about the new CDS.

Put that the Prime Minister had not given a full answer in the Commons, the PMS said that the position here was that these decisions were no longer for politicians. They were now for the NHS Commissioning Board. Whether or not there was a target of two weeks or not was a matter for the Commissioning Board. The PMS said that at the moment it remained in place, but whether particular targets remained in place in the future would be a matter for them.

Asked why Simon Burns had said a couple of hours ago that it would not be scrapped, the PMS said that it remained in place. Rather than the Secretary of State defining targets for the NHS, the people who knew about the NHS would define targets where they thought those targets would help in driving the right clinical outcomes.

Asked what the NHS Commissioning Board was, the PMS replied that it was the board that would oversee the NHS. Put that the Prime Minister had said in opposition that politicians should take responsibility for front line services, the PMS said that of course politicians took responsibility, but the decision on what targets were appropriate should be taken by the people who understood the processes in the NHS.",Appointment of Bronwen Maddox to the board of the Imperial War Museum,Institutional,Other,id25_599

David Cameron thanked Dr Fox for the “superb job” he has done as Secretary of State.

Prime Minister David Cameron wrote:

Dear Liam,Thank you for your letter.I understand your reasons for deciding to resign as Defence Secretary, although I am very sorry to see you go.We have worked closely for these last six years, and you have been a key member of my team throughout that time.

You have done a superb job in the 17 months since the election, and as Shadow Defence Secretary before that.You have overseen fundamental changes in the Ministry of Defence and in our Armed Forces, which will ensure that they are fully equipped to meet the challenges of the modern era.On Libya, you played a key role in the campaign to stop people being massacred by the Gaddafi regime and instead win their freedom.You can be proud of the difference you have made in your time in office, and in helping our  party to return to Government.I appreciate your commitment to the work of this Government, particularly highlighting the need to tackle the deficit, and  the relationship between Britain’s economic strength and our national security.You and Jesme have always been good friends, and I have truly valued your support over the years. I will continue to do so in the future.Yours ever,

David

The Prime Minister was responding to the letter of resignation written by Dr Liam Fox:

Dear David,

As you know, I have always placed a great deal of importance on accountability and responsibility. As I said in the House of Commons on Monday, I mistakenly allowed the distinction between my personal interest and my government activities to become blurred. The consequences of this have become clearer in recent days. I am very sorry for this.

I have also repeatedly said that the national interest must always come before personal interest. I now have to hold myself to my own standard. I have therefore decided, with great sadness, to resign from my post as Secretary of State for Defence - a position which I have been immensely proud and honoured to have held.

I am particularly proud to have overseen the long overdue reforms to the Ministry of Defence and to our Armed Forces, which will shape them to meet the challenges of the future and keep this country safe.

I am proud also to have played a part in helping to liberate the people of Libya, and I regret that I will not see through to its conclusion Britain’s role in Afghanistan, where so much progress has been made.

Above all, I am honoured and humbled to have worked with the superb men and women in our Armed Forces. Their bravery, dedication and professionalism are second-to-none.

I appreciate all the support you have given me - and will continue to support the vital work of this government, above all in controlling the enormous budget deficit we inherited, which is a threat not just to this country’s economic prosperity but also to its national security.

I look forward to continuing to represent my constituents in North Somerset.

The UK will invest up to £20 million in the African Union’s new ‘African Union Covid19 Response Fund’ to tackle coronavirus and save lives.

This makes the UK the largest national donor to the fund, which was announced by Cyril Ramaphosa, Chairperson of the African Union (AU) and President of the Republic of South Africa last month. It will support African leaders and technical experts to slow the spread of coronavirus and save lives in Africa and worldwide.

The fund will tackle the pandemic by recruiting African health experts and deploying them where they are needed most, strengthening global tracking of the pandemic, combatting potentially harmful misinformation, providing specialist coronavirus training for health workers and making information about the virus more accessible to the public.

Announcing the funding today, International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said:

“As the UK faces its biggest peacetime challenge in tackling coronavirus, it’s never been more important to work with our partners in Africa to fight disease.

“No one is safe until we are all safe and this new funding and support for African leadership will help protect us all – in the UK, Africa and around the world – from further spread of the virus.”

The announcement follows calls between Minister for Africa James Duddridge, AU Commissioner for Trade and Industry Albert Muchanga and AU Commissioner for Social Affairs Amira El-Fadil in which they discussed the risks Africa faces from the pandemic and how the UK is working with partners on the continent to tackle these shared global issues.

This new support for the African Union comes after the UK has already pledged over $900 million to the international fight against coronavirus. The UK is also using its existing aid programmes to help vulnerable countries in Africa to strengthen their health systems. It also comes ahead of the UK hosting the virtual Global Vaccine Summit on 4th June, to secure future funding for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which has already saved the lives of millions of children in Africa from infectious diseases

Many countries on the continent are beginning to see exponential increases in coronavirus case numbers, presenting a severe risk to fragile healthcare systems. The high prevalence of HIV, malnutrition and other illnesses in parts of Africa may also worsen the impact of the virus. In sub-Saharan Africa, there are on average just 2 doctors for every 10,000 people, compared to 28 per 10,000 in the UK.

If healthcare systems become overwhelmed, the worldwide spread of the virus will be difficult to slow, risking new waves of infection. The UK’s contribution to the Covid19 Response Fund will prevent this by working in partnership with the AU to help fight the virus, strengthen healthcare systems and save lives in the AU’s 55 member states.

Today’s announcement brings the total UK aid contribution to fighting coronavirus to up to £764 million ($935.6 million). This money is helping to find a vaccine, providing vital humanitarian relief, feeding the world’s poorest people, strengthening global healthcare systems and managing the risk of a global economic downturn.

The UK Conformity Assessed (UKCA) marking has been introduced as part of the UK’s own robust regulatory framework. It shows that products comply with our product safety regulations which are designed to protect consumers.

However, given the difficult economic conditions created by post-pandemic shifts in demand and supply, alongside Putin’s war in Ukraine and the associated high energy prices, the government does not want to burden business with the requirement to meet the original (31 December 2022) deadline.

The government will continue to recognise theCEmarking for 2 years, therefore allowing businesses until 31 December 2024 to prepare for theUKCAmarking. Businesses can also use theUKCAmarking, giving them flexibility to choose which marking to apply.

Business Secretary Grant Shapps said:

The government is determined to remove barriers to businesses so they can get on with their top priorities, like providing quality customer service, enabling growth and supporting their staff.

This move will give businesses the breathing space and flexibility they need at this crucial time and ensure that our future system for product safety marking is fit for purpose, providing the highest standard for consumers without harming businesses.

To support manufacturers, the government is also reviewing the wider product safety framework, ensuring we minimise the burdens on business while keeping our system up to date with new innovative methods such as e-labelling.

As part of this, the government will make it easier than ever for businesses to apply product markings.

This package will give thousands of businesses, including electronics and lift manufacturers, additional time to focus on delivering growth and creating jobs, while giving them flexibility in how they meet their legal obligations.

There will be different rules for medical devices, construction products, cableways, transportable pressure equipment, unmanned aircraft systems, rail products, and marine equipment. Government departments responsible for these sectors are making sector specific arrangements.

TheUKCAmarking covers most goods which previously required theCEmarking, known as ‘new approach’ goods, in addition to aerosols that previously required the ‘reverse epsilon’ marking.

Whilst theUKCAmarking can be used now this extension means businesses can choose to use theCEmarking until 31 December 2024.

This sits alongside measures to reduce the costs of retesting products and labelling.

To reduce labelling costs, we will allow businesses to affix theUKCAmarking and include importer information for products fromEEAcountries on an accompanying document or label until 31 December 2027.

We will also allow conformity assessment activities forCEmarking undertaken by 31 December 2024 to be used by manufacturers as the basis for theUKCAmarking, until 31 December 2027.

To extend the deadline, the government has today laid secondary legislation before Parliament which, subject to parliamentary approval, will implement these measures.

Businesses have been able to use theUKCAmark since 1 January 2021 to demonstrate their conformity with product standards in England, Scotland and Wales.

Under the terms of the Protocol, Northern Ireland will continue to recognise theCEmarking for goods placed on the market in Northern Ireland. They will need to use theUKNImarking if they use a UK Conformity Assessment Body to test their products.

The government has published theUK Market Conformity Assessment Bodies databasewhich businesses can use to identify the appropriate body to certify their products.

To find out which regulations apply to your product, businesses should read theProduct safety for businesses: A to Z of industry, guidance published by the Office for Product Safety and Standards.",Contribution of £25 million to the Marine Plastics Research and Innovation Framework,Monetary,Fiscal Incentives,id25_603

India, Canada and other Commonwealth nations have already signed up to be part of the new Marine Plastics Research and Innovation Framework – a hub where researchers will be able to connect and collaborate on the latest research and innovations to tackle marine plastics.

The UK will play a leading role in designing and running the Framework, encouraging the world to move towards clean growth through the government’s modernIndustrial Strategy. An international steering board will oversee the work.

The Prime Minister announced that theUK would contribute £25 million to the Frameworkduring the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London.

So far Unilever has committed £5 million in research and development, while Waitrose has pledged £0.5 million of research.

The British Plastics Federation, which represents more than 500 UK companies, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRiAP), RPC Group Plc and engineering giant Mott MacDonald are among those who have given their support, including access to their facilities, networks and expertise.

Energy and Clean Growth Minister Claire Perry said:

Plastics are not only polluting our waters, they are contributing to climate change and killing sea life.

With our funding, matched by research being developed by nations throughout the Commonwealth, this £50 million Framework will help develop options for alternative uses to prevent plastics from ending up in our seas. It also ensures that the UK is at the forefront of encouraging the world to move towards clean growth, tackling the threat from marine plastics and protecting our oceans for future generations.

Minister of State for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation, Sam Gyimah said:

Plastics are clogging our oceans and threatening our sea life to devastating effect.

This hub will bring together the brightest minds in UK science and innovation to solve this problem.

Chief Executive Officer of Unilever Paul Polman said:

It is critical that governments, businesses and others from across the Commonwealth work in partnership to step away from our take-make-dispose model of consumption.

We are delighted to be contributing £5 million worth of research and development to the Framework.

She said: “Today’s report provides a wake- up call. It recognises that there is no part of our society which is immune from the effects of climate change. Which means that every part of our society must think about its resilience.

”This Government is pushing ahead with measures to ensure that climate change adaptation becomes an ingrained part of how we manage our natural environment - particularly in critical areas such as water efficiency, biodiversity and food production.

“Adapting to climate change may also offer some major opportunities. The transition to a low carbon, well-adapted global economy could create hundreds of thousands of sustainable green jobs. But we must - all of us - take steps now to recognise the problem, analyse the risk and plan ahead.”

The ASC’s report concludes that, with the impacts of climate change already being felt in the UK, people must start preparing now. It recognises that progress has been made by Government in raising awareness, and identified five priority areas where more action needs to be taken - land use, planning, infrastructure, buildings, natural resources and emergency planning.

In response to the report, Defra has prepared a Strategic Statement, exploring how work will be taken forward in these areas.

Earlier in the week (13 Sept) Environment Minister Lord Henley welcomed the CBI’s report, ‘_Whatever the weather - Managing the risks from a changing climate’ _and stressed the need for businesses to rise to both the threats and opportunities of a changing climate in order to build a globally competitive, green and thriving economy for the UK.

The Adaptation Sub-Committee (ASC) is a sub-committee of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), established under the Climate Change Act 2008. The ASC is an independent statutory body that provides advice to Government to ensure that their programme for adaptation enables the UK to prepare effectively for the impacts of climate change.",Appointments of William Cockbain and David Macdonald to the Natural England Board,Institutional,,id25_605

(Our guidance was published in February 2016. This press release was published in February 2013 and has not been updated since)

All dogs in England will need to be microchipped to help tackle the growing problem of strays roaming the streets, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson announced today.

The Government is bringing in compulsory microchipping for all dogs from 6 April 2016 to help reunite owners with lost or stolen pets, relieve the burden on animal charities and local authorities and protect the welfare of dogs by promoting responsible dog ownership.

Support from Dogs Trust, the UK’s largest dog welfare charity, means a free microchip will be available for all unchipped dogs in England.

Environment Secretary, Owen Paterson, said:

It’s a shame that in a nation of dog lovers, thousands of dogs are roaming the streets or stuck in kennels because the owner cannot be tracked down. I am determined to put an end to this and ease the pressure on charities and councils to find new homes for these dogs.

Microchipping is a simple solution that gives peace of mind to owners. It makes it easier to get their pet back if it strays and easier to trace if it’s stolen. The generous support of Dogs Trust will mean that this valuable service can be offered for free to pet owners across the country.

Currently there are around 8 million pet dogs in the UK. Nearly 60 per cent are already chipped.

Owners will be able to get their dog microchipped for free at any of the 18 Dogs Trust centres across the UK, and free microchips will be offered by Dogs Trust to local authorities, housing associations and veterinary surgeries.

Battersea Dogs and Cats Home have announced that free microchipping will be offered at their three centres, and the Blue Cross will also offer free microchipping to dogs and cats at their 16 hospitals and centres across England.

Clarissa Baldwin, Chief Executive of Dogs Trust, said:

We are delighted that the Government has taken this prescient move to introduce compulsory microchipping for all dogs in England. This immediate method of identification is essential to improve dog welfare.

This will help to reduce the number of dogs that needlessly end up with an uncertain fate in council pounds and rescue centres when their owners simply cannot be traced. We urge dog owners to view microchipping as part and parcel of dog ownership and, importantly, also take responsibility for keeping their contact details up to date.

Kim Hamilton, Blue Cross chief executive, said:

Compulsory microchipping will make a huge difference to the work of charities like Blue Cross as we struggle to find homes for an increasing number of stray and unwanted pets. We will be offering both cats and dogs microchipping at Blue Cross rehoming centres and animal hospitals across England. We also welcome plans to allow more flexibility on kennelling suspected banned breeds, as this will have a lasting impression on pet welfare and the wellbeing of dogs.

Claire Horton, Chief Executive of Battersea Dogs & Cats Home, said:

Battersea warmly welcomes today’s Government announcement on microchipping in England. It’s so worrying for owners when a dog strays from home, yet a tiny microchip the size of a grain of rice means charities like Battersea can often reunite pets with their owners within hours. Having no chip in a dog can mean any reunion can take days to happen, if it happens at all. So our three centres around London will help by offering dog owners free microchipping for their dog.

Owen Paterson also announced that the police are being given new powers to tackle dangerous dogs and keep the public safe.

The laws on dog attacks will be extended to cover private property, closing a loophole which has meant that dog owners whose animals have attacked people on private property are immune from prosecution.

Eight children and six adults have been killed in dog attacks since 2005, with many of these attacks taking place in the home. In the last year alone, over 3,000 postal workers were attacked by dangerously out of control dogs, and 70 per cent of these attacks happened on private property.

Householders, however, will be protected from prosecution if their dog attacks a burglar or trespasser on their land.

Mr Paterson added:

Most people take proper care of their dogs but there are a small minority of people who behave irresponsibly, allowing their dogs to threaten and attack people.

People like health and postal workers, who have to go on private property just to do their jobs, deserve protection under the law. By giving the police extra powers to clamp down on law-breakers, those responsible for the worst offences will be held to account regardless of where the attack takes place.

Government measures will also allow the police, when dealing with any dogs which are subject to court proceedings under the Dangerous Dogs Act, to decide whether a suspected prohibited dog needs to be kept apart from their owners until the outcome of court proceedings. Previously all such dogs had to be kennelled until after proceedings had concluded, even if they posed no risk to the public.

The changes follow a consultation which ran from 23 April 2012 to 15 June 2012. Over 27,000 people responded to the consultation and abreakdown of their responsesis available.",£37.5 million subsidy to support Post Office network and £20 million boost for postmasters,Welfare,,id25_607

Work to be completed quickly with those affected to determine appropriate redress for those without criminal convictions

Government confirms £37.5 million subsidy to support Post Office network as company sets out £20 million boost for postmasters

Today the government has officially recognised Capture, the software which preceded Horizon, could have created shortfalls affecting postmasters. It has asked the Post Office to urgently review its files and evidence so the CCRC and SCCRC can ensure no one was wrongfully convicted of a Horizon-style injustice.

Responding to the independent Kroll report into the software, the Business Secretary has promised to provide redress for postmasters who suffered losses as a result of Capture. The government will work swiftly with victims to determine its form and scope, alongside eligibility criteria, by Spring 2025.

The Capture accounting system was rolled out across some Post Office branches from 1992 before it was replaced by Horizon in 1999. The government commissioned the independent report following postmasters coming forward publicly in January indicating they had faced detriment due to the Capture system. In its report, Kroll concluded Capture could have created shortfalls.

The response comes as the government marks £499 million paid to more than 3,300 Horizon victims. We are delivering on our promise to ensure swift and fair redress to postmasters, more than doubling the amount of redress paid out since coming into government 5 months ago.

It is thanks to testimony of postmasters that this has been brought to light and failings have been discovered.

We must now work quickly to provide redress and justice to those who have suffered greatly after being wrongly accused.

I’d like to encourage anyone who believes they have been affected by Capture to share their story with us so we can put wrongs to right once and for all.

It’s taken a long time to reach this point which is why my priority now is to deliver justice and redress to postmasters as swiftly as possible.

We will do everything we can to correct the mistakes of the past and ensure they are not repeated.

Postmasters have raised concerns with me that their income has not kept up with inflation over the past decade. The Government therefore welcomes that the Post Office is going to make a one-off payment to postmasters to increase their remuneration.

Due to the length of time which has passed since the Capture system was in use several issues have complicated the investigation including:

Far greater timescales, meaning a greater population of the users may have sadly died

Loss or destruction of relevant evidence for example relating to shortfalls, suspensions, terminations, prosecutions, and convictions

At least 19 different operational versions of the Capture software during the period

Ambiguous number of users during this period

Unlike Horizon, it is currently uncertain how many criminal prosecutions were based on Capture evidence. These challenges also mean it will be difficult for claimants to corroborate their claims with evidence.

The Post Office has indicated it holds further information on convictions and prosecutions during the Capture period. The government has asked them to carry out their review of these records urgently and send information to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) and Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC).

Ensuring postmasters receive the justice they deserve is an immediate priority for this government. The Kroll report does not take a view whether any possible convictions were unsafe. We will continue to facilitate the provision of information to the CCRC and SCCRC, alongside the Post Office, in connection with the review of cases involving the use of Capture as the approach to redress is developed at pace.

Minister Thomas will also announce the government is supporting the Post Office network with a further £37.5 million subsidy. It comes as the Post Office today announces a £20 million boost for postmasters to address their concerns that their income has not kept up with inflation over the past decade.

Under the Plan for Change, this government will make public services deliver for working people once more. The Post Office is an important British institution at the heart of local communities, but for too long neglect has enabled significant issues to take root. We will strengthen the Post Office network – pledged in our manifesto - so the people’s trust can be restored.",Call for evidence and subsequent legal requirement,Legislative,Other,id25_608

The 8-week consultation aims to bring everyone into the conversation about what’s working well and what could work better in the curriculum and marks the next step in the government’s independent review.

Responses will be invaluable in shaping the direction of the review and pivotal to the recommendationsProfessor Becky Francis and her expert panelput forward in 2025.

Today’s call for evidence covers a range of specific areas, including how best to provide an excellent foundation in English and maths, support for children from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, and access to a broad and balanced curriculum.

The review will also take written and oral evidence from key stakeholders, alongside a series of regional engagement events from mid-October to meet and take input from young people and staff on the frontline.

Spanning from key stages 1 to 4 and 16 to 19 education, the review will look closely at the key challenges to attainment for young people, and the barriers which hold children back from the opportunities and life chances they deserve – in particular those who are socio-economically disadvantaged, or with special educational needs or disability (SEND).

Professor Becky Francis said:

The curriculum belongs to the nation. And especially, it must work for the young people who follow it, and the teachers and lecturers that communicate it.

As such, it’s imperative that we hear perspectives and evidence from as wide a range of people as possible including children, young people, parents, education professionals and other stakeholders.

The launch of our call for evidence today enables that. And we have sought to keep questions broad and wide-ranging, to enable people to have their say.

There is much that is working in the present curriculum, but this is a chance to refresh, to address areas which aren’t working well, and to ensure excellence for all. I hope as many as possible will respond and I look forward to reading the responses.

The review will look at ensuring all young people aged 16 to 19 have access to rigorous and high-value qualifications and training that will give them the skills they need to seize opportunity, as well as ensuring they are ready for the changing workplace.

It will also look at whether the current assessment system can be improved for both young people and staff, while protecting the important role of examinations.   
Following the review, all state schools – including academies which currently do not have to follow the national curriculum – will be required by law to teach the national curriculum up to age 16, giving parents certainty over their children’s education.

TheImproving the curriculum and assessment call for evidenceruns from 25 September to 22 November 2024.

Some 67 WTO members, including both developed and developing countries, have delivered an agreement on Services Domestic Regulation which cuts red tape around licensing and qualifications and is set to reduce services trade costs by up to 7% annually.

The UK has been a strong and vocal participant throughout negotiations since they were launched at the 11th Ministerial Conference in Buenos Aires in 2017, particularly after formally taking up our independent seat at the WTO last year. As the world’s second-largest services exporter, the UK is among the countries positioned to benefit the most from its terms.

British businesses consistently cite complex administrative procedures as barriers to accessing international markets. The new rules will make it easier for businesses of all sizes – particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – to navigate foreign markets and obtain authorisation to export overseas.

Once the new rules are in force, businesses can expect licensing applications to be processed in a timely manner, acceptance of electronic copies of qualifications by competent authorities, and an end to unreasonable and hidden fees.

The UK will be among a handful of nations applying the new rules across the broadest possible range of services sectors, including financial services. The biggest savings are likely to be in finance and tech – helping ensure London retains its position as Europe’s leading financial centre.

“We are delighted to have played our part in bringing about this historic deal, which shows exactly the kind of cooperation we want to see at the WTO and demonstrates it can deliver trade rules fit for the 21st century.

“As the world’s second largest services exporter, the UK is particularly aware of how important it is to cut red tape and get trade flowing to build back better from the pandemic.”

“This agreement will be celebrated by the UK’s financial and related professional services industry. It is an essential step towards removing the types of trade barriers most often experienced by services exporters.

“This necessary and innovative agreement will reduce costs for UK businesses, support women’s economic empowerment, and is a significant win for the WTO and wider multilateral economic cooperation.”

“Sixty-seven WTO members coming together to agree on an outcome which delivers Services Domestic Regulation is a meaningful achievement that has real commercial value for services providers all around the world.

“Services Domestic Regulation brings increased predictability and transparency to the technical standards, licensing and qualification requirements and procedures that affect services providers every single day when they work internationally.”

“We are delighted to see the approval of rules on domestic regulation. This sends a strong signal about the continuous relevance and importance of multilateral rules for services providers in an increasingly globalised world.

“We believe that rules on domestic regulation will set common principles for enacting laws on the provision of services, which will help create more transparency.

“For the legal sector, this will mean greater predictability and information about the applicable regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions. This, in turn, will help reduce the compliance costs and uncertainty for many services providers.”

“This is a welcome development for the UK financial and professional services sector, with global services providers set to benefit from the removal of unnecessary administrative processes that can act as barriers to market access around the world.

“Services trade is a key driver of prosperity and this announcement will help to support the global post-Covid recovery.

“We hope that the WTO can carry this momentum into other important future policy challenges.”

In a first of its kind for the WTO, the agreement contains a provision on gender equality. This will support the participation of women entrepreneurs in global services trade and improve the inclusiveness of services trade.

The deal has also created a new baseline in international services trade. The UK has already used it as a foundation when striking free trade agreements with Japan, the European Union, and Australia, building enhanced provisions on services trade upon it.

Hand-and-pole line fishermen of under-10m vessels, which includes some of those affected by the zero Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for pollack, will be able to benefit from fast-tracked applications for a share of £6 million in grant funding available through the Fisheries and Seafood Scheme.

Separately, they will also have the opportunity to be paid for their participation in a new scientific study which will aim to understand more about the stock structure of pollack – and sell the pollack that they catch as part of the study.

During recent fisheries negotiations with the EU, it was decided pollack can only be caught as bycatch in 2024. This followed advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) to set the TAC for pollack to zero.

The government’s approach to negotiating catch limits is based on the latest scientific advice, balanced with commitments to economic sustainability and providing opportunities for the UK fleet, consistent with the objectives of the Fisheries Act.

We fully recognise the impact that the bycatch-only pollack fishery has had on many fishermen in the South West and today’s measures will provide support to those most affected.

Grant funding will help to support them to diversify and explore other income streams, whilst their participation in a new scientific study will not only provide additional support but help to improve our understanding of the pollack stock as we look to improve its sustainability into the future.”

TheFisheries and Seafood scheme (FaSS)has relaunched for 2024, with approximately £6 million in match funding available to projects that support the development of the catching, processing and aquaculture sectors, and those enhancing the marine environment.

Administered by Marine Management Organisation (MMO) on behalf of Defra, applications from all fishermen are encouraged, but hand-and-pole line fishermen of under-10m vessels, which includes some of those affected by the zero TAC for pollack, will see their applications fast-tracked, with processing time reduced from eight weeks to four weeks.

This will help to get support to those most affected more quickly, helping them with diversification and to explore new forms of income.

Separately, affected fishermen will also have the opportunity to supplement this income through taking part in a new scientific study led by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas).

The study will be open to all fishermen and will see collaboration between scientists and fishermen to increase understanding about the stock structure of pollack.

Fishermen will catch pollack for use in the study, receiving payments for their initial training and for their participation in the study – and would be able to sell the pollack they have caught.

Applications, along with detailed eligibility criteria, will be open as soon as possible.

To improve the longer-term management of pollack, the UK will work with the EU via the Specialised Committee on Fisheries (SCF) towards an improved assessment of the stock.

The government will continue to work with industry representatives as part of this. This joint work will also help to improve our understanding of the recreational fishery, with a view to the introduction of limits where appropriate and where these are likely to be effective in reducing pressure on the stock.","New code of practice with retail, hospitality and property sectors",Administrative,,id25_611

The extension, until the end of September, comes alongside further support to help local businesses plan for economic recovery following the coronavirus pandemic.

A newcode of practicehas been developed with leaders from the retail, hospitality and property sectors to provide clarity for businesses when discussing rental payments and to encourage best practice so that all parties are supported.

These interventions are in addition to the comprehensive financial package provided by the UK government to businesses during this difficult time and is in recognition of the strain that the sector is currently under.

The code is voluntary for businesses and is relevant to all commercial leases held by businesses in any sector which have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.

It encourages tenants to continue to pay their rent in full if they are in a position to do so and advises that others should pay what they can, whilst acknowledging that landlords should provide support to businesses if they too are able to do so.

The suspension of the forfeiture of evictions will come as a relief in particular to pubs, cafes and restaurants, after the hospitality sector called upon the government for action in this area.

Communities Secretary, Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:

As our high streets come to life and our town centres open for business, it is crucial that both landlords and tenants have clarity and reassurance as they seek to keep their finances stable and bounce back.

That is why we are extending measures to protect those who are unable to pay rent from eviction so that businesses have the security they need to plan for their futures.

And in recognition of the strain that the virus has had on our high streets, our new code, backed by leaders across the industry, will help unlock conversations on rent and future payments whilst ensuring best practice is displayed across the board as we confront the challenges of this pandemic.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma MP said:

From clothes stores to our local book shop, we want as many high street businesses as possible to emerge from the pandemic, in the best position to bounce back.

During this particularly challenging time for businesses, our retail stores are safely welcoming shoppers back and taking the necessary steps to drive economic recovery.

By putting a stop to unreasonable evictions, these measures will protect jobs and provide further flexibility to our high street businesses that were trading successfully before the COVID-19 emergency, so they can focus on continuing to deliver for their customers and communities.

Across the UK, the code will encourage tenants and landlords to be transparent in their discussions and to act reasonably and responsibly whilst recognising the impact that coronavirus has had on businesses’ finances.

The UK government has confirmed the following changes to the existing package of measures for the commercial sector:

UK Finance has alsoconfirmedits members’ continued support for commercial landlord customers including amendments to facilities and capital payment holidays.

The UK government’s financial package of measures to support businesses during the economic emergency includes:

View thecode of practice.

It was developed and coordinated by the UK government alongside a working group of the following, who have all endorsed the code; British Chambers of Commerce, British Property Federation, British Retail Consortium, the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council, Revo, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and UKHospitality.

The working group was also supported by Trowers & Hamlins LLP who provided expert legal advice during the code’s development.

To date, a number of other organisations have also endorsed the code including; Agricultural Law Association; Association of Convenience Stores; British Beer and Pubs Association, British Independent Retailers Association, Central Association of Agricultural Valuers, Country Land Association, Federation of Small Businesses, Property Owners Forum, Scottish Property Federation, Tenant Farmers Association and Tenant Farmers Association Cymru, UKActive and UK Major Ports Group.

Jane Gratton, Head of People Policy, British Chambers of Commerce said:

The pandemic has created severe cashflow problems for many SMEs, who will need time to rebuild and recover.  This code will help landlords and tenants to work together constructively to find solutions that keep businesses open and people in work.

Melanie Leech, Chief Executive, British Property Federation said:

The majority of property owners and occupiers are already working well together, creating shared solutions to mitigate the impact of coronavirus on their businesses. The code of practice published today builds on the many examples of good practice and reinforces the importance of constructive collaboration – not only over the next few months and once the government’s temporary legislative interventions come to an end later this year, but for the long term.

The success of landlords and tenants working together as economic partners is vital to the UK’s recovery and to help ensure that viable businesses in distress as a result of coronavirus are supported, to protect both people’s jobs and the local authorities, savers and pensioners who own the majority of our town centres.

Helen Dickinson, Chief Executive, British Retail Consortium said:

The ongoing pandemic presents an enormous threat to the survival of thousands of retailers, and the millions of jobs they support. The necessary closure of most shops during lockdown has created a gaping hole in many retailers’ finances. This has been exacerbated by continued rent demands on stores around the country, even where most have been closed for business. A solution is needed.

This code is a first step toward improving the dialogue between retailers and their landlords. An extension to tenant protections against aggressive behaviour from some landlords is essential to underpin it, and we warmly welcome the government’s commitment to this.

However, all parties should recognise that the code does not provide a solution for those retailers who are simply unable to pay what is being demanded, and we now look forward to continuing our constructive dialogue with government and other parts of the property sector to address these unpayable rents. Without further action, both retailers and landlords remain in a precarious situation that could lead to substantial numbers of redundancies as soon as tenant protections expire.

Peter Cosmetatos, Chief Executive, Commercial Real Estate Finance Council said:

Commercial real estate investment and finance markets are a complex, interconnected ecosystem; the pandemic-related stress affecting so many rent-paying businesses also threatens their landlords, and their investors and their lenders, with potential implications for economic recovery.

This code cannot magically plug revenue holes, but it sends a strong signal that good faith engagement and financial transparency are essential if commercial tenants and landlords are to find their way through this crisis.

Vivienne King, Chief Executive, Revo said:

Revo is pleased to support the government code of practice, which offers guidance to property owners and occupiers in navigating temporary rent arrangements through the pandemic, whilst underwriting the sanctity of existing contractual terms.

There are many cases of owners and occupiers collaboration in managing loss of income, which the code of practice reflects and we will continue to support government in identifying the potential measures to address this loss of income, which not only impacts owners and occupiers, but the wider economy including the savers and pensioners who depend upon it.

Paul Bagust, Global Property Standards Director, Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said:

We are pleased to have helped government in shaping this code which will increase constructive engagement and transparency between landlords and tenants at this challenging time. We believe it will provide a basis for negotiated measures which recognise the mutual importance and interdependence of landlords and tenants in contributing to the economy.

Kate Nicholls, CEO, UKHospitality said:

The near-total wipeout of income from the hospitality sector has left it unable to meet its rent obligations. This code goes some way to bringing together landlord and tenant in the pursuit of a negotiated solution to allow hospitality businesses to move on and revert to the new normal, but this must be recognised as a first step that needs to be built on by all parties.

We remain of the view that further time and support is needed to facilitate a recovery for the hospitality sector, that is at the heart of our social lives and communities. The extension of the moratorium on aggressive enforcement and forfeiture is a welcome measure to allow this process to take place.

Rishi Sunak said the newBounce Back Loans scheme, which will provide loans of up to £50,000, would help bolster the existing package of support available to the smallest businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

The scheme has been designed to ensure that small firms who need vital cash injections to keep operating can get finance in a matter of days, and comes alongside the £6 billion awarded in business grants, supporting 4 million jobs through the job retention scheme and generous tax deferrals supporting hundreds of thousands of firms.

The government, which has been consulting extensively with business representatives about the design of the new scheme, will provide lenders with a 100% guarantee for the loan and pay any fees and interest for the first 12 months. No repayments will be due during the first 12 months.

The loans will be easy to apply for through a short, standardised online application. The loan should reach businesses within days- providing immediate support to those that need it as easily as possible.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, said:

Our smallest businesses are the backbone of our economy and play a vital role in their communities. This new rapid loan scheme will help ensure they get the finance they need quickly to help survive this crisis.

This is in addition to business grants, tax deferrals, and the job retention scheme, which are already helping to support hundreds of thousands of small businesses.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma said:

Our small businesses are vital in ensuring our communities thrive and will be crucial in creating jobs and securing economic growth as we recover.

This rapid loan scheme offers additional protection so small companies across the country can get access to the finance they need immediately, as part of the unprecedented package of support we have put in place.

The scheme will launch for applications on Monday 4 May. Firms will be able to access these loans through a network of accredited lenders.

The government will work with lenders to ensure loans delivered through this scheme are advanced as quickly as possible and agree a low standardised level of interest for the remaining period of the loan.

Our Covid-19 support schemes have provided over £15 billion for business in just a few weeks. We’ve put in place:

Mike Cherry, Federation of Small Businesses National Chairman, said:

This crucial new initiative should enable thousands of small businesses to access the working capital they need quickly, helping to protect the millions of jobs they provide in every part of the UK.

This step forward marks another decisive intervention from the Treasury and the Business Department, building on existing support in an innovative way. Swift delivery is now key, and we also look forward to working with government in the long-term to enhance market competition, including that provided by non-bank lenders.

We are pleased to see the Chancellor and the Business Secretary listening to the needs of small businesses, and we will continue to work with them to make sure small firms and the jobs they provide are protected throughout this public health challenge and that small firms are at the forefront of leading the recovery.

Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI Director-General, said:

The Chancellor’s new 100% guaranteed loan scheme for small businesses is transformational. Sole traders, micro-firms and entrepreneurs will now have a simple route to fast finance to stay afloat, without red tape or time-consuming checks.

Thousands of businesses could be saved by this lifeline. Banks now need to continue their work in overdrive to get the loans flowing faster.

It’s good to see the Chancellor listening to business, proving that where there’s a need to adjust schemes, he will do what it takes. It will be vital to maintain this approach in the months to come. Every job saved today will ensure a faster recovery tomorrow.

Jonathan Geldart, IoD Director General:

This is a welcome intervention, which should help ensure more firms can access the finance that could see them through this crisis. Business leaders will appreciate the government’s continued flexibility in adapting their response to what’s happening on the ground.

It’s crucial that the government’s support cuts through to those who need it. Having a quick and simple process will be vital, and we need to remember that taking on debt is always a difficult decision for small firms.

Entitlement to Statutory Maternity Pay, as well as the other forms of Parental or Adoption Pay, are currently calculated through someone’s average earnings over an 8-week assessment period. For Maternity Allowance, entitlement and the rate payable is also determined by looking at average earnings over a 13 week period.

The statutory instrument laid in Parliament today will ensure workers whose period of family-related pay begins on or after 25 April will be assessed on their usual, full pay.

The changes will ensure those intending to take time off following the birth, adoption, or death of a child will not see their entitlement to pay affected as a result of being furloughed in the wake of the impacts ofCOVID-19.

Business Minister Paul Scully said:

Maternity and other forms of parental leave are pivotal times in people’s lives, and they should absolutely be protected from the impacts ofCOVID-19.

We are supporting workers and businesses in a way never seen before, in response to the unprecedented effects ofCOVID-19. These measures will ensure those on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme continue to receive the parental leave and pay they are entitled to.

Lords Minister for the Department for Work and Pensions, Baroness Stedman-Scott said:

At an already challenging time for families, peace of mind that they can rightly take time off and receive their full entitlement will provide much needed reassurance.

Throughout this health emergency we’ve taken unprecedented steps to help those affected make ends meet, and today’s new measures further extend vital financial support.

Pregnant women and new mothers are entitled to take up to 52 weeks of Maternity Leave. Up to 39 weeks are paid. For women who qualify for Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP), this is paid at 90% of usual earnings for the first 6 weeks, followed by 33 weeks at the statutory rate (currently £151.20). Adoption Leave and Statutory Adoption Pay (SAP) are the same.

To be eligible forSMPorSAP, a person’s average weekly earnings must be at least equal to the Lower Earnings Limit (currently £120 per week) over a prescribed 8-week test period. A person’s earnings over this period are also used to determine the earnings-related rate ofSMPorSAPfor the first 6 weeks.

Maternity Allowance is a benefit paid to working mothers (including self-employed mothers) who do not qualify forSMP– this is worth up to £151.20 a week for up to 39 weeks. Entitlement toMA, and the rate payable, are determined by reference to 13-weeks earnings in a 66-week test period.

Statutory Paternity Pay is up to 2 weeks long and is paid at the lower of £151.20 per week, or 90% of average earnings.

Shared Parental Pay is up to 50 weeks long and is paid at the lower of £151.20 per week, or 90% of average earnings.

Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay is 2 weeks long and is paid at the lower of £151.20 per week, or 90% of average earnings.

To be eligible for Paternity, Shared Parental and Parental Bereavement Pay, a person’s average weekly earnings need to exceed the Lower Earnings Limit (currently £120 per week) over a prescribed 8-week test period.",Formal commitments from Virgin Holidays (undertakings),Legislative,Administrative,id25_614

Even when customers were informed by Virgin Holidays that they would receive a refund, many had to wait for an unreasonably long time, with some being told they would have to wait 120 days to receive their money back. Since 1 March 2020, the company has received 53,000 refund requests.

The CMA has now secured formal commitments from Virgin Holidays – known as ‘undertakings’ – that ensure all of its customers receive their money without undue delay and by the following dates:

If Virgin Holidays does not repay customers by these dates, the CMA is prepared to take the company to court.

Virgin Holidays will also ensure that people who are entitled to a refund for a holiday cancelled on or after 1 November 2020 will be paid within 14 days.

These undertakings apply to all Virgin Holidays businesses that offer package holidays, including Virgin Holidays Cruises.

To ensure that Virgin Holidays adheres to its commitments, the company must provide the CMA with regular reports on the progress of its repayments.

Andrea Coscelli, Chief Executive at the CMA, said:

People whose holidays have been cancelled due to coronavirus deserve a prompt and full refund.

Our action means that Virgin Holidays customers should receive all their money back without further delay.

We are continuing to investigate package holidays in relation to the coronavirus crisis. Should we find that any business is not complying with consumer protection law, we won’t hesitate to take action.

Today’s announcement follows significant action by the CMA in relation to holiday cancellations.It has written to over 100 package holiday firms to remind them of their obligations to comply with consumer protection law, and has alreadysecured refund commitments from TUI UK,Sykes CottagesandVacation Rentals.

In order to help businesses to understand their legal obligations with regard to consumer protection law, theCMA published a statement on its view of how the law relates to cancellations and refunds due to coronavirus.

Announced by the Science Secretary Peter Kyle today (Friday 26 July), the hubs will bring researchers and businesses together to use their scientific expertise and talent alongside the commercial know-how and resources to develop groundbreaking quantum technologies that will directly impact people’s lives in areas like healthcare, security, and clean energy.

The new innovations in quantum will not only help deliver the government’s first mission to kickstart economic growth by creating new technologies in hubs that can be sold and exported to drive up GDP, but by innovating in the science and technology industry, it will support the delivery of the government’s missions to rebuild Britain, with quantum technology helping to build a more efficient NHS that is fit for the future and future-proofing cyber security to keep our streets safe.

The Science Secretary made the announcement on a visit to the University of Glasgow, who will lead one of the hubs aiming to develop quantum technologies for resilient position, navigation and timing systems in national security and critical national infrastructure. This technology can offer enhanced accuracy and reliability in sectors including aerospace, autonomous vehicles, finance, maritime, and agriculture. The hub will also develop smaller, lighter devices that use quantum technology. These devices could be used in transportation systems like roads, railways, and underground networks by replacingGPSand improving systems that help vehicles find their way.

These new hubs will be centres for advancements in areas like quantum-enhanced blood tests, fasterMRIscanners, and new surgical interventions and treatments. This could mean faster detection of diseases like cancer, allowing for earlier medical interventions and potentially saving lives. Ultimately, these breakthroughs could translate to better patient outcomes and easing pressure on our hardworking NHS.

They will also explore technologies crucial for national security. This could see aircraft operating with improved positioning systems that are resistant toGPSjamming, or submarines able to operate for extended periods without relying on satellites. Additionally, research into a ‘quantum internet’ could create secure and future-proof communication networks, safeguarding sensitive data and communications infrastructure – helping protect citizens and the economy.

Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, Peter Kyle, said:

We want to see a future where cutting-edge science improves everyday lives. That is the vision behind our investment in these new quantum technology hubs, by supporting the deployment of technology that will mean faster diagnoses for diseases, critical infrastructure safe from hostile threats and cleaner energy for us all.

This isn’t just about research; it’s about putting that research to work. These hubs will bridge the gap between brilliant ideas and practical solutions. They will not only transform sectors like healthcare and security, but also create a culture of accelerated innovation that helps to grow our economy.

The University of Birmingham will develop advanced sensing technologies with the ability to ‘see the invisible’. This could mean detecting gas leaks before they become a danger, or pinpointing hidden objects that pose safety risks. These advancements will significantly improve public safety and infrastructure maintenance.

These five new hubs will be led by leading universities across the UK and will work closely with industry partners. This collaboration ensures that research translates into real-world applications that benefit the public. The Quantum Technology Hubs are:

The hubs will be delivered by theUKRIEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), with a £106 million investment fromEPSRC, theUKRIBiotechnology and Biological Research Council,UKRIMedical Research Council, and the National Institute for Health and Care Research.

EPSRCExecutive Chair Professor Charlotte Deane said:

Technologies harnessing quantum properties will provide unparalleled power and capacity for analysis at a molecular level, with truly revolutionary possibilities across everything from healthcare to infrastructure and computing.

The five Quantum Technology Hubs announced today will harness the UK’s expertise to foster innovation, support growth and ensure that we capitalise on the profound opportunities of this transformative technology.

The government’s investment in these quantum hubs signifies a commitment to developing technologies that directly improve people’s lives. From revolutionising healthcare to bolstering national security, these hubs have the potential to shape a safer, healthier, and more secure future for all.

Supportive quotes from the quantum hubs:

Professor Gerald Buller, Director of the IQN Hub, said:

The Integrated Quantum Networks Hub will provide the underpinning research required towards the establishment of a UK-wide quantum network. Harnessing excellent research from a wide range of partners, it will delivering quantum networks at different scales, from local data centres to inter-city links and up to global satellite connections. Establishing a widescale quantum internet could have impact across all sectors, predominantly allowing future-proof security for data communications, as well as linking up quantum computers and sensors with benefits ranging from healthcare to materials research, artificial intelligence and many others.

Professor Rachel McKendry, Co-Director of the Q-BIOMED Hub, said:

Q-BIOMED is the first UK Quantum Research Hub dedicated to health and positions the UK at the forefront of this exciting new field globally. We are bringing together an outstanding team of researchers from academia, the NHS, charities, government, regulators and industry to help accelerate advances in quantum for human health and societal good. The ultimate beneficiaries of earlier diagnosis will be patients through faster access to life- saving treatment, and the NHS though more cost-effective models of care. We also hope to grow an innovation ecosystem working with industry and international networks of excellence with leading researchers worldwide.

Professor Douglas Paul, Project Lead for the QEPNT Hub, said:

Much of the UK’s critical infrastructure relies on the accurate measurements of time, direction and speed which enable us to stay in constant contact with communications satellites. Currently, those connections are vulnerable to disruption through technical problems or deliberate malicious actions like signal-jamming.

If those connections are lost for any reason, it would have a huge impact on key industries like energy, finance, communications and transport, causing an estimated economic loss of a billion pounds a day until service is restored.

This new hub will support the development of new and improved forms of atomic clocks, quantum gyroscopes and quantum accelerometers. Those technologies, integrated into portable and affordable future devices, will help reduce our reliance on satellites by providing new ways to locally measure position, navigation and timing.

Unlike current technologies, they will work indoors, underground and in all weathers, helping to bolster the UK’s national security and offering new applications for industry.

Professor Michael Holynski, Director of QuSIT, said:

We are delighted to form a new Quantum Technology Hub in sensing. Our aim is to accelerate the commercial development of quantum sensing, imaging and timing devices, which will result in real societal and economic benefits.

We look forward to working closely with our partners, the other new QT Hubs, our fundersEPSRC, and the wider academic and industry communities to ensure quantum technologies deliver their best for society.

Professor Dominic O’Brien, Director of the QCI3 Hub, said:

The QCI3 Hub brings together industry, academia and government partners to deliver new applications, ideas and innovations that will advance the field of quantum computing, impacting areas such as materials science, chemistry, finance and logistics. The Hub will train a new generation of scientists and engineers, providing the critical skills for a UK quantum economy, whilst also developing the commercial skills needed for those looking to play key roles in the UK’s growing quantum industry. Our rich partner network will ensure that our research is grounded around real-world problems and that we are able to transfer technology out of the lab to make meaningful impact.

A £25 million investment over the next 2 years will accelerate the development of new women’s health hubs to benefit women across England and help to ease pressures facing the NHS.

The hub models will be tailored to meet local women’s needs. They will focus on delivering services in the community that better fit around women’s lives and streamline access to women’s health services. Hubs aim to address fragmentation in provision, for example by providing management of contraception and heavy bleeding in one visit, or integrating cervical screening with other aspects of women’s health care. At the moment, women often need to attend multiple appointments and go to different places to access these essential services.

As well as improving women’s experiences of healthcare, hubs can create longer-term savings for the NHS through improving access to preventative care and reducing pressure on secondary care services.

Health and Social Care Secretary Steve Barclay said:

As we celebrate International Women’s Day, it is important we look back on the real progress made on the rollout of our Women’s Health Strategy - including making hormone replacement therapy more accessible and supporting women’s reproductive health in the workplace.

New funding of £25 million for women’s health hubs - which provide tailored services for women including menopause care, menstrual health and contraception - mean more women can get the right support that works around their daily lives.

Minister for Women’s Health, Maria Caulfield said:

Women make up 51% of the population and should not be an afterthought in healthcare.

Better access to specialist services is key to tackling health inequalities - the £25 million funding will create new women’s health hubs providing specialist care and advice to women across the country.

We are making excellent headway to meet our commitments set out in England’s first ever Women’s Health Strategy, aiming to boost the health and wellbeing of women and girls.

Early adopter women’s health hubs already exist in England including in Liverpool and Manchester. These have been well received by women in their area and are offering a significant increase in appointments for long-acting reversible contraception, alongside other services such as menstrual health, menopause, and pelvic floor care.

Other existing hubs make use of digital models to tackle inequalities in access to care and ensure services are delivered efficiently. These include City and Hackney women’s health hub which is leading the way with virtual menopause engagement events and group consultations, with follow up in a physical location hub where needed.

Based on consultation with more than 100,000 people across England, the Women’s Health Strategy sets out an ambitious ten-year plan for improving the health and wellbeing of women and girls and reforming how the health and care system listens to them.

As part of this, Professor Dame Lesley Regan was appointed as the Women’s Health Ambassador. Her role is instrumental in raising the profile of women’s health, increasing awareness of ‘taboo’ topics, and supporting implementation of the strategy’s priorities.

Professor Dame Lesley Regan, Women’s Health Ambassador:

As a practicing gynaecologist, I have first-hand experience of how important it is for women to have easy access to the right care when they need it.

Although a woman’s health needs change during her life course, most of them are predictable. It is crucial that we provide her with the best information and support at each and every stage of her journey.

Women’s health hubs offer us the opportunity to provide holistic care - including contraception, help with period problems, early pregnancy problems, pelvic pain, menopause and cancer screening. Timely access to high quality services will help to build women’s confidence in the healthcare system.

Expanding women’s health hubs across England is a key commitment in the first ever government-ledWomen’s Health Strategy for England, with an initial aim to see at least one hub in every integrated care system (ICS).

The Department of Health and Social Care is working collaboratively with stakeholders across the health and care system to develop resources to support local creation of women’s health hubs, including a best practice guide, possible care pathways for local adoption, case studies and a cost benefit analysis. This will be published in due course.

Expanding women’s health hubs is one of ministers’ top priorities for the first year of implementing the Women’s Health Strategy. The 8 priorities are:

NHS chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, said:

For too long, too many women have felt that their pain has been ignored, misunderstood or downplayed when they approach health professionals for help.

The NHS is continuing to find ways to ensure women’s health is prioritised, that more focus is placed on their needs, and that access to the care they need is as convenient as possible - whether that’s for menstrual problems, menopause or contraception.

So it is fantastic, particularly on a day where we are recognising women, that this new funding will be made available to support the NHS to expand these one stop shops across the country.

They are already making a huge difference where they are up and running and will hopefully go a long way in improving the health and experiences of women.

This comes following last week’s announcement that the government has appointed a Department of Work and PensionsMenopause Employment Champion. Helen Tomlinson will work with employers to ensure women affected by the menopause are properly supported in the workplace.

The Taskforce has seen increasing numbers of complaints in relation to cancellations and refunds, which now account for 4 out of 5 complaints being received. So far, concerns include people being pressured to accept vouchers for holiday accommodation which can only be used during a more expensive period, wedding venues refusing to refund any money and telling people to claim on their insurance, and nurseries asking people to pay very high sums in order to keep a place open for their child.

Based on the complaints received, the CMA has identified 3 sectors of particular concern:

The CMA will tackle these areas as a priority and then move on to examine other sectors, based on the information received by the CMA COVID-19 Taskforce.

The CMA acknowledges that most businesses are trying to do the right thing in these unprecedented circumstances but, at the same time, ordinary consumers deserve to have their rights protected. It also advises that businesses should not be profiting by ‘double recovering’ their money from the Government and from customers.

If it finds evidence that companies are failing to comply with the law, the CMA will take appropriate enforcement action, which could include taking a firm to court if it does not address its concerns.

As well as examining specific sectors, the CMA is todayissuing a statementon its views on consumer protection law in relation to cancellations and refunds during the current crisis.

The statement covers a range of consumer contracts and different situations. It includes that, in most cases, the CMA would expect a full refund to be offered if:

a business has cancelled a contract without providing any of the promised goods or services

no service is provided by a business, because this is prevented by restrictions that apply during the current lockdown or

a consumer cancels, or is prevented from receiving any services, because of the restrictions that apply during the current lockdown

Andrea Coscelli, CEO of the CMA, said:

Our COVID-19 taskforce is shining a light on some of the big issues facing consumers in wake of this pandemic. We are now seeing cancellation issues in their thousands. So far, the CMA has identified weddings, holiday accommodation and childcare as particular areas of concern.

The current situation is throwing up challenges for everyone, including businesses, but that does not mean that consumers should be deprived of their rights at this difficult time. If we find evidence that businesses are failing to comply with consumer protection law then we will take tough enforcement action to protect those rights.

If people have been affected by unfair cancellation terms in wake of coronavirus, they can report them to the CMA using theonline form.

Regular testing ensures the system is functioning correctly, should it be needed in an emergency.

The test will function like a real life Emergency Alert.

Emergency Alerts work on all 4G and 5G phone networks in the UK. Your mobile phone or tablet does not have to be connected to mobile data or wifi to get alerts.

However, you will not receive alerts if your device is: turned off; connected to a 2G or 3G network; wifi only; or not compatible.

There are approximately 87 million mobile phones in the UK.

Devices will vibrate and make a loud siren sound for roughly ten seconds. A test message will also appear on screens.

The message will say:

“This is a test of Emergency Alerts, a UK government service that will warn you if there’s a life-threatening emergency nearby.

“You do not need to take any action. In a real emergency, follow the instructions in the alert to keep yourself and others safe.

“Find simple and effective advice on how to prepare for emergencies atgov.uk/prepare.

“Visitgov.uk/alertsfor more information or to view this message in Welsh. Ewch igov.uk/alertsam ragor o wybodaeth neu i weld y neges hon yn y Gymraeg.”

Lots of other countries operate similar emergency systems and run regular tests, including Japan and the United States of America.

Some countries test their systems monthly, such as Finland, while other countries test their systems annually, such as Germany.

Data about you, your device or location will not be collected or shared.

The emergency services and the UK government do not need your phone number to send you an alert.

It is illegal to use a hand-held device while driving. Find somewhere safe and legal to stop before reading the message.

Emergency alerts contain life-saving information and should be kept switched on for your own safety.

However, there may be some scenarios where it is sensible to opt out of alerts, including victims of domestic abuse with a concealed phone.

The government will continue ongoing engagement with domestic violence charities and campaigners in the run up to the test, to ensure people know how to switch off alerts on a concealed phone.

How you opt out depends on your device.

Full instructions telling you how to opt out are available at [https://www.gov.uk/alerts/opting-out]

If you still get alerts after opting out, contact your device manufacturer for help.

During the test, audio and vibration attention signals will let you know you have received an alert, if accessibility notifications have been enabled on your mobile phone or tablet.

Bringing back the family doctor is central to the government’s plan to rebuild the health service, and the changes being made to cut through the current rules will help more patients get access to GPs and ensure more GPs are able to find roles, so that people in communities across England will receive the timely care they deserve this year.

Currently, under a scheme known as the Additional Roles Reimbursement Scheme, primary care networks (PCNs) can claim reimbursement for the salaries (and some on-costs) of 17 new roles within the multidisciplinary team - meaning more specialists are available to treat patients.

They are selected to meet the needs of the local population, but are currently prevented from using this to recruit additional GPs. The changes announced today (1 August 2024) mean that newly qualified GPs can quickly be recruited into the NHS through this scheme in 2024 to 2025.

It’s thought hundreds of newly qualified GPs could be without a job this summer in England. But thanks to this intervention, they will be able to be hired by the end of the year.

The government is listening to GPs, and this has been hard fought by the British Medical Association (BMA), the Royal College of General Practitioners and many other groups who petitioned for it, receiving over 11,000 signatures.

It comes as the government accepts recommendations of the pay review bodies in full, increasing GPs’ pay by 6% - their first meaningful pay rise in years.

Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting said:

It is absurd that patients can’t book appointments while GPs can’t find work.

This government is taking immediate action to put GPs to work, so patients can get the care they need.

This is a first step, as we begin the long-term work of shifting the focus of healthcare out of hospitals and into the community, to fix the front door to the NHS.

I want to work with GPs to rebuild our NHS, so it is there for all of us when we need it.

Dr Amanda Doyle, National Director for Primary Care and Community Services, said:

With hard-working GP teams delivering millions more appointments a month compared to before the pandemic, it is vital they are given the resources to manage this increase in demand.

Adding GPs to the scheme is something that the profession has been calling for in recent months to make it easier for practices to hire more staff - so I welcome this measure which is an important first step to increasing GP employment in the long term.

We will continue to work with GPs, theBMAand the government to avert any potential action, but in the meantime the NHS has a duty to plan for any possible disruption to ensure services continue to be provided for patients - so the public should continue to come forward for care in the normal way if collective action does go ahead.

This is an emergency measure for 2024 to 2025 to ensure patients are able to access GPs and GPs are able to find roles, while the government works with the profession to identify longer-term solutions to GP unemployment and general practice sustainability as part of the next fiscal event.

The government will ensure the NHS has the funding it needs to deliver this, paid for by £82 million from the existing department budget.

The River Wye and its surrounding area is cherished by residents and visitors, however, the condition of the river is declining due to pressures including climate change, invasive species, and pollution from various sources, including from farms across the catchment area. The government is working at pace to intervene after the condition of the River Wye Special Area of Conservation (SAC), which covers the stretch of the river in England, was downgraded to ‘Unfavourable – Declining’ last year.

TheRiver Wye Action Plansets out a range of measures to begin protecting the river immediately from pollution and establish long-term plans to restore it for future generations. This includes requiring large poultry farms to export manure away from areas where they would otherwise cause excess pollution and providing up to £35m in grant support for on-farm poultry manure combustors in the Wye Special Area of Conservation catchment to facilitate the export of poultry litter to where it is needed.

Combusting poultry manure provides a source of renewable energy and converts manure to a nutrient rich ash, which is a valuable fertiliser that is easier to transport and use on farms - reducing risk to the environment. Any new combustion units will need approval and we will work with local stakeholders and regulators to ensure robust assessments for protection of the environment and human health.

The Farming Minister has also appointed former Member of European Parliament, Anthea McIntyre CBE, as ‘River Champion’ in the Wye catchment. As a resident of the Wye Catchment and having represented the West Midlands Region as an MEP for eight years, Anthea will bring a deep understanding and appreciation for local issues – particularly in the water and agricultural sectors.

In this role, she will bring together key organisations and partners to protect and restore the Wye, including by supporting a long-term catchment plan. This will involve working alongside the local Catchment Partnership and citizen scientists, who have already made great progress in bringing together farmers and other land managers around a long-term plan to restore the river.

The River Wye Action Plan builds on significant measures already in place under ourPlan for Waterand farming schemes to help farmers speed up their transition to more sustainable agricultural practices.

The River Wye is facing real challenges, which is why the government is taking action to restore this important landscape and ensure it is better protected for future generations.

Our plan will dramatically reduce the amount of nutrients entering the river, mostly by helping farmers transition to more sustainable practices. This will include providing up to £35m for on farm poultry litter combustors and trialling the use of emerging technology to help farmers share organic nutrients with their neighbours.

I’m also pleased to announce the appointment of Anthea McIntyre, who as a local and a former West Midlands region MEP will spearhead government action on the ground to improve the health of the river.

I’m very honoured to be appointed as the River Wye Champion and look forward to working with all the committed partners in the Wye Catchment to improve the quality of our vitally important river.

Having lived close to the River Wye since my teens, and represented this area over many years, I am determined to work collaboratively with all the interested parties to ensure the river is restored and protected for future generations.

The River Wye is a beautiful and important part of our landscape, our resources and community wellbeing. The introduction of this wide-ranging plan allows the Environment Agency to capitalise on its work already underway with partners, local farmers and environmental groups to tackle the decline in water quality in the catchment. Together we can progress the long-term solutions needed to restore this vital waterway.

Since April 2023, the Environment Agency has carried out over 500 farm inspections across the Wye catchment, helping farmers comply with legal requirements and resulting in more than 315 actions identified to improve farm practices. These range from improving slurry storage to better management of nutrients. Our regulatory work will continue across the Wye, with Environment Agency officers inspecting farms as well as using technology such as satellite images and drone footage.

A healthy and thriving River Wye and the catchment is key to recovering nature in Herefordshire, so benefiting wildlife and people. We are pleased to see further action being implemented by the government to support the wide range of partners working to restore the Wye.

Natural England is delivering nature positive advice supporting hundreds of farms within the Wye catchment as part of the Catchment Sensitive Farming programme and backing the Wyescapes and Wye Valley – Ridge to River – Landscape Recovery Projects in the area, as well development of Herefordshire’s local nature recovery strategy.

The excellent work of citizen scientists has helped the government better understand the challenges the river is facing, and this Plan aims to build on their efforts to prevent and reverse damage.

Improved nutrient management will also deliver benefits for farmers, such as reducing reliance on inorganic fertilisers, a major input cost for farmers. We will continue to work closely with the community and partners in England and Wales to ensure we are taking the necessary steps to best protect the river.",Williams-Shapps plan for rail,Legislative,Other,id25_624

Funded by the Department for Transport, the upgrade allows up to 2 freight trains an hour in each direction, meaning more trains will be able to deliver vital goods to and from the port for import and export, meeting predicted demand for rail freight for the coming decades.

Work on the track along the Bootle line has been a long-term project and it reopened to freight traffic in September 2021. The upgrade is now alleviating pressure on the pinch point between the West Coast Main Line and the Port of Liverpool by doubling the previous 400 metre section of single track.

Not only has this enabled an increase in the amount of goods that can be transported, making an important contribution to the national economy, it will do so without adding more lorry journeys, congestion and emissions to our road network. Moving goods by rail results in just one-quarter of the equivalent carbon dioxide emissions compared to road, and rail freight supports the country in meeting our targets for net zero.

ThePlan for railoutlined this government’s strong commitment to the future of the railways in Great Britain for the benefit of passengers and rail freight customers. The upgrade of this important line in the North West not only demonstrates this but will also ensure that we continue to build back greener as we invest in more sustainable methods of transporting goods.

Chris Heaton-Harris Rail Minister said:

I am delighted that the upgraded Bootle line has opened, offering more opportunities for reliable, greener rail freight to transport goods to and from the thriving Port of Liverpool.

Rail freight is one of the most sustainable ways to move goods and it is exciting to see our investments in the North boosting the economy and levelling up the region.

Phil James, North West route director at Network Rail, said:

We have been delighted to work with Peel Ports and the Department of Transport to remove a bottleneck on the rail network for economically and environmentally important freight trains.

With a new 400 metre double-tracked railway successfully in place, it gives the Port of Liverpool increased capacity to transport more goods by train. This will cut carbon emissions and reduce congestion by taking lorries off our roads, helping the country build back better after the pandemic.

David Huck, Managing Director of Peel Ports, said:

This is truly transformational news for the Port of Liverpool and for the future of sustainable supply chains. The new rail line upgrade enables even more choice and connectivity for customers by providing 4 departures per day from the container terminal. This is in addition to our long-standing bulk rail services.

We can now reach the central belt of Scotland as well as East and West Midland destinations with ease. Combined with our significant investments in infrastructure, our people, processes and technology, the news further strengthens the proposition for Liverpool as a strong, viable alternative location to southern ports.

Key goods that pass through the Port of Liverpool and will benefit from this rail freight upgrade include the export of Scottish goods, such as shortbread and whisky, to American markets by DB Cargo.

A new GB Railfreight service between Liverpool and the East Midlands also launched in late 2020, aiming to take 20,000 lorry journeys off the roads and avoid some of the most congested motorways in the country.

This significant investment in the sustainable movement of goods is part of the delivery of the government’s enhancements to rail freight, set out within the Williams-Shapps plan for rail.

626,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/free-chickenpox-vaccination-offered-for-first-time-to-children,Press release,Free chickenpox vaccination offered for first time to children,A free chickenpox vaccination will be offered for the first time to children across England on the NHS from January.,"Department of Health and Social Care, NHS England, UK Health Security Agency and Stephen Kinnock MP",29 August 2025,"Thousands of children will be protected against chickenpox for the first time in England through a new vaccination programme that will keep kids in school and parents in work while also saving the NHS vital funds.

From January next year, GP practices will offer eligible children a combined vaccine for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) - the clinical term for chickenpox - as part of the routine infant vaccination schedule.

It will mean kids miss fewer days in nursery and school while parents will not need to take time off work to care for them. Research shows that chickenpox in childhood results in an estimated £24 million in lost income and productivity every year in the UK. The rollout will also save the NHS £15 million a year in costs for treating the common condition.

The chickenpox vaccine has been safely used for decades and is already part of the routine vaccine schedules in several countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia and Germany.

Minister of State for Care, Stephen Kinnock, said:

We’re giving parents the power to protect their children from chickenpox and its serious complications, while keeping them in nursery or the classroom where they belong and preventing parents from scrambling for childcare or having to miss work.

This vaccine puts children’s health first and gives working families the support they deserve. As part of our Plan for Change, we want to give every child the best possible start in life, and this rollout will help to do exactly that.

The vaccination programme forms part of the government’s wider ambition to raise the healthiest generation of children ever as part of our Plan for Change - boosting the nation’s health and ensuring the future sustainability of the NHS as we shift the focus of healthcare from sickness to prevention.

The vaccine will help reduce cases of chickenpox and protect children from serious complications that can cause hospitalisation, such as bacterial infections like strep A, brain and lung inflammation, and stroke.

Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, Deputy Director of Immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency, said:

Most parents probably consider chickenpox to be a common and mild illness, but for some babies, young children and even adults, chickenpox can be very serious, leading to hospital admission and tragically, while rare, it can be fatal.

It is excellent news that from next January we will be introducing a vaccine to protect against chickenpox into the NHS routine childhood vaccination programme - helping prevent what is for most a nasty illness and for those who develop severe symptoms, it could be a life saver.

We now have extensive experience from a number of countries showing that the vaccine has a good safety record and is highly effective. The programme will have a really positive impact on the health of young children and also lead to fewer missed nursery and school days.

The government’s decision to roll out theMMRVvaccine in January is based on expert scientific advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), following research showing the significant impact of severe cases of chickenpox on children’s health, hospital admissions and associated costs.

Private vaccinations for chickenpox at pharmacies and clinics currently cost around £150 for a full course of 2 doses. This rollout will mean the vaccination will be available free of charge on the NHS to eligible children.

Other countries where theMMRVvaccine is already offered - such as Germany, Canada and the United States - have seen substantial decreases in chickenpox cases and related hospital admissions since introducing their vaccination programmes.

Amanda Doyle, National Director for Primary Care and Community Services at NHS England, said:

This is a hugely positive moment for families as the NHS gets ready to roll out a vaccine to protect children against chickenpox for the first time, adding to the arsenal of other routine jabs that safeguard against serious illness.

We will work with vaccination teams and GP surgeries across the country to roll out the combinedMMRVvaccine in the new year, helping to keep children healthy and prevent sickness from these highly contagious viruses.

TheMMRVvaccine rollout forms part of the government’s overall aim to ensure young people thrive, as part of the10 Year Health Plan. This includes expanding access to vaccines, as well as free school meals, mental health support and dental care.

This is the first time protection against another disease has been added to the routine childhood vaccination programme since the MenB vaccine in 2015.

Meanwhile, the Department for Education has recently announcedplans to roll out Best Start Family Hubs in every local area, relieving pressure on parents and giving half a million more children the very best start in life.

The eligibility criteria for children will be set out in clinical guidance covering which age groups will get theMMRVvaccine and when, to ensure the most effective protection for children.

As with other childhood immunisations, parents will be contacted by their GP surgery to arrange an appointment if their child is eligible.",Drop-in session,Informational,,id25_626

In recent months, robust steps have been made under the Plan for Water withall 15,000 storm overflows now monitoredand the cap on civil penalties for pollution removed. Last week,Defra went further in announcing that water bosses are set to be bannedfrom receiving bonuses if a company has committed serious criminal breaches.

The Environment Agency (EA) is already ramping up inspections on water company assets, with over 930 completed this financial year. Today’s announcement goes further as water company inspections carried out by the EA will rise to 4000 a year by the end of March 2025, and then to 10,000 by April 2026. This will include an increase in unannounced inspections – strengthening oversight of water companies and reducing the reliance on water company self-monitoring, which was established in 2009.

Increased inspections and enforcement will be backed by around £55 million each year. This will be fully funded through increased grant-in-aid from Defra to the Environment Agency and additional funding from water quality permit charges levied on water companies, subject to apublic consultationclosing in March 2024.

We are clear that we need to get much tougher with unannounced inspections to bring an end to the routine lawbreaking we have seen from water companies, which is what this announcement will deliver.

We are going further to quadruple the Environment Agency’s regulatory capacity – allowing them to carry out 4,000 water company inspections by the end of the next financial year.

Last year we set out measures to transform the way we regulate the water industry to uncover non-compliance and drive better performance.
Today’s announcement builds on that. Campaign groups and the public want to see the Environment Agency better resourced to do what it does best, regulate for a better environment.

Proposals to get extra boots on the ground to increase inspection visits will help further strengthen our regulation of the industry.”

With 100% of storm overflows now monitored, data-driven analytics will also help the Environment Agency map discharges against rainfall more effectively so they can quickly direct new specialist officers to any sites at risk, identify any non-compliance and take action.

The EA is already conducting the largest ever criminal investigation into potential widespread non-compliance by water and sewerage companies at thousands of sewage treatment works.

This means that in the vast majority of cases, whether a patient needs a GP, hospital or a care home, the professionals involved in their care can see their history at the touch of a button and share crucial information.

His speech comes as 2 reports are also published which demonstrate the potential benefits of making better use of technology.

A Price Waterhouse Coopers study reviewing the potential benefits of better use of information and technology found that measures such as more use of text messages for negative test results, electronic prescribing and electronic patient records could improve care, allow health professionals to spend more time with patients and save billions.

A National Mobile Health Worker report, also published today, was a pilot study on introducing laptops at 11 NHS sites.

On the way towards the 2018 goal, the Health Secretary wants to see:

TheNHS Commissioning Boardis leading implementation and it has set a clear expectation that hospitals should plan to make information digitally and securely available by 2014/15.

This means that different professionals involved in one person’s care can start to safely share information on their treatment. This is set out inthe NHS Commissioning Board’s recent publication ‘Everyone Counts: planning for patients in 2013/14′.

Jeremy Hunt said:

_“The NHS cannot be the last man standing as the rest of the economy embraces the technology revolution. _

“It is crazy that paramedics cannot access a full medical history of someone they are picking up in an emergency - and that GPs and hospitals still struggle to share digital records.__

_“Previous attempts to crack this became a top down project akin to building an aircraft carrier. We need to learn those lessons - and in particular avoid the pitfalls of a hugely complex, centrally specified approach. _

investment will fund new government-industry taskforce to ensure sovereign capabilities and broad adoption of safe and reliable foundation models, helping cement the UK’s position as a science and technology superpower by 2030

£100 million to kickstart the delivery of the government’s major ambitions for the UK’s capability in safe and reliable foundation models has been announced by the Prime Minister and Technology Secretary.

The Taskforce, modelled on the success of the COVID-19 Vaccines Taskforce, will develop the safe and reliable use of this pivotal artificial intelligence (AI) across the economy and ensure the UK is globally competitive in this strategic technology.

Foundation models - including large language models like ChatGPT and Google Bard - are a category of artificial intelligence systems trained on huge volumes of data such as text, images, video or audio to gain broad and sophisticated capabilities across many tasks.

​​WithAIset to contribute billions of pounds to UKGDP, the work of the Taskforce will help deliver on the Prime Minister’s priorities to grow our economy, whilst generating better outcomes for people across the country through better public services. Research suggests that the broad adoption of such systems could triple national productivity growth rates.

In areas like healthcare, this type ofAIhas enormous potential to speed up diagnoses, drug discovery and development. In education it could transform teachers’ day-to-day work, freeing up their time to focus on delivering excellent teaching.

This technology is also predicted to raise globalGDPby 7 percent over a decade, making its adoption a vital opportunity to grow the UK economy. To support businesses and public trust in these systems and drive their adoption, the Taskforce will work with the sector towards developing the safety and reliability of foundation models, both at a scientific and commercial level.

The investment will build the UK’s ‘sovereign’ national capabilities so our public services can benefit from the transformational impact of this type ofAI. The Taskforce will focus on opportunities to establish the UK as a world leader in foundation models and their applications across the economy, and acting as a global standard bearer forAIsafety.

The funding will be invested by the Foundation Model Taskforce in foundation model infrastructure and public service procurement, to create opportunities for domestic innovation. The first pilots targeting public services are expected to launch in the next six months.

The Taskforce, announced as part of the Integrated Review Refresh last month, will bring together government and industry experts and report directly to the Prime Minister and Technology Secretary.

This follows last week’s Cabinet meeting where Ministers agreed on the transformative potential ofAI, the vital importance of retaining public confidence in its use, and the need for regulation that keeps people safe without preventing innovation.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said:

Harnessing the potential ofAIprovides enormous opportunities to grow our economy, create better-paid jobs, and build a better future through advances in healthcare and security.

By investing in emerging technologies through our new expert taskforce, we can continue to lead the way in developing safe and trustworthyAIas part of shaping a more innovative UK economy.

Science, Innovation and Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan said:

Developed responsibly, cutting-edgeAIcan have a transformative impact in nearly every industry. It can revolutionise the way we develop new medical treatments, tackle climate change and improve our public services, all while growing and future-proofing our economy.

We need to act now to seize the opportunitiesAIcan offer us in the future. We’re backing our expert taskforce with the funding to make our ambitions for anAI-enabled country a reality and keep the UK at the front of the pack in this emerging technology.

To ensure such leadership, the greatest capability we can develop is in the safety and reliability of such systems. This will ensure that the public and business have the trust they need to confidently adopt this technology and fully realise its benefits. That is exactly what this taskforce will prioritise.

The taskforce will be led by an expert Chair, who will be announced later in the summer. Matt Clifford, Chair of the Advanced Research and Innovation Agency, will advise the Prime Minister and Technology Secretary on the development of the taskforce while the appointment is ongoing.

Foundation models rely on significant compute power, and this investment comes on top of around £900 million for a new ‘exascale’ supercomputer and a dedicatedAIResearch Resource to equip the UK with the processing power it needs to support the next generation ofAIinnovation. The Taskforce will play a crucial role in ensuring the major, multi-year funding announced at the Budget for compute is strategically invested to prioritise and strengthen the UK’s capability in foundation models.

The Taskforce will ensure the UK’s capability in this rapidly developing area is built with safety and reliability at its core, in line with the approach set out in theAIRegulation White Paperpublished last month.

Doug Gurr, Chair,  The Alan Turing Institute, said:

We congratulate the government on this exciting investment which will keep the UK at the cutting edge of this transformative technology and look forward to continuing to work with all the relevant partners to help develop breakthroughAIapplications in a safe, reliable, trustworthy and ethical way.

Marc Warner, CEO of Faculty, said:

Artificial intelligence is an epoch-defining technology, which - if deployed safely and responsibly - will revolutionise how we live and work. To reap the rewards and manage the risks, the UK urgently needs the public and private sector to work effectively together to seize the vast opportunities from foundational models. It is welcome to see initial funding towards this goal, which will help ensure safe deployment and protect national security, whilst harnessingAI’s power to transform public services.

The funding follows Business Connect, an event bringing government and industry together to focus on making Britain the most innovative economy in the world.DSITMinister of State George Freeman led a panel on the government’s work in digital technology and life sciences and, together with the Chancellor, spoke about how these high-priority sectors could help accelerate economic growth across the UK.",Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (REMA),Legislative,,id25_634

The Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (REMA) will seek views on a wide range of options to address the combined challenges of responding to higher global energy costs, the need to further boost energy security and move the UK to a cleaner energy system.

Some of the changes being consulted on include:

Under the current system, gas prices often end up setting the wholesale electricity price, because it is often the last source of supply to meet demand. The ever-increasing participation of renewables in the system means over time, cheaper electricity produced by renewables energy will determine the price more often. This consultation will explore ways of updating this pricing system to further reflect the rise in cheaper renewable electricity - something that could have a direct impact on reducing energy costs, ensuring consumers reap the full benefits of the UK’s world-leading and abundant supply of cheaper, cleaner energy.

Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said:

We’ve just seen the price of offshore UK wind power fall to an all-time low and gas is a shrinking portion of our electricity generating mix, so we need to explore ways of ensuring the electricity market is adapting to the times.

That includes ensuring the cost benefits of our increasing supply of cheaper energy trickle down to consumers, but also that our system is fit for the future – especially with electricity demand set to double by 2035.

In what could be the biggest electricity market shake up in decades, I am confident that this review will significantly enhance GB’s energy security and supply for generations to come.

Today’s consultation launch forms part of the government’s comprehensive review of the electricity market, first announced in theBritish Energy Security Strategy (BESS). TheBESSsignificantly raised ambitions for building low carbon and cheaper-to-run technologies such as offshore wind, solar and nuclear, as part of UK plans to deliver a clean and secure electricity system by 2035.

The UK is already making huge progress in accelerating the delivery of cheaper, home-grown renewable energy. Earlier this month, the UK secured a record capacity of almost 11GW of clean energy at record low prices, through the government’s flagship renewables scheme - almost double the capacity achieved in the previous round, and enough to power around 12 million British homes.

With electricity demand set to at least double over the next 13 years,REMAwill focus on establishing a fit-for-purpose market design, identifying and implementing the reforms needed to GB electricity markets that work for businesses, industry, and households.

This includes consulting on both the continued evolution and expansion of existing schemes, such as the Capacity Market and Contracts for Difference, and the introduction of more fundamental change where needed to guarantee uninterrupted supply during periods of no wind or sun at the lowest cost possible for consumers.

Energy Minister Greg Hands said:

Today’s launch ofREMAis a major step in delivering a secure energy future for Britain, putting in place the electricity market design we need to allow us to make the most of our world-leading diversity of power sources while offering more value for money for consumers.

Today marks the first major consultation stage withinREMA’s comprehensive programme of work. Through this initial consultation, the UK government will engage extensively with the sector to develop and assess options for reform, with a response expected to be published this winter. Following this consultation, the department will further develop, refine and narrow down options for reform during 2022-2023 before delivering proposed reforms.

A National Grid ESO spokesperson said:

We welcome the breadth and depth ofBEIS’ Review of Electricity Market Arrangements. Wholesale markets need reforming to meet net zero and deliver better outcomes for consumers across Britain.REMAis the right forum for stakeholders to align on what is needed.

AnOfgemspokesperson said:

Protecting consumers is our top priority which is why we are supporting government to do this wide-ranging Review of Electricity Market Arrangements. A fair energy market that protects consumers’ interests will only work if we can make best use of Britain’s cheap, plentiful renewable resources and invest in ways that deliver a low-cost net zero power system using our home-grown energy.

We now look forward to working closely with government and all participants on this timely review to ensure our energy market arrangements deliver in consumers’ interests and help to make bills better.

Deputy Director at Energy UK, Adam Berman, said:

The energy industry is ready to help create an affordable, clean power system that meets both our Net Zero and Energy Security targets.REMAwill help to ensure that the energy market can channel private investment to deliver on the government’s ambitious targets for delivering clean, low-cost, domestically produced electricity.

With the cost of energy reaching unprecedented levels, it’s right and timely that the government reviews how to provide the most efficient market arrangements to support decarbonisation - so that it reduces bills in the long term.

Director of RenewableUK’s Future Electricity Systems, Barnaby Wharton, said:

The electricity system will go through a profound transformation over the next decade as we continue to expand our renewables capacity. It’s vital that we have a market which supports investments in new projects and infrastructure and allows consumers to get the full benefits of a low cost, low carbon system.

This consultation is an important step forward in that process, and the industry will continue to work closely with government on building the clean energy system which the UK needs to reach net zero as fast as possible.

The government is undertaking a comprehensive Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (REMA), as announced in the British Energy Security Strategy, to help deliver our world-leading climate targets whilst reducing exposure to volatile international gas markets, bringing major energy security and cost benefits

Read theReview of electricity market arrangements consultationwhich is open until 10 October 2022.

The consultation sets out why we believe that reform is necessary in our case for change, on which we are seeking views.

The UK government will introduce reform where this proves necessary.

REMAwill consider a range of options for reform to electricity markets and policies that can provide signals for the investment in, and operation of, assets that generate or use electricity. It will cover wholesale markets, the balancing mechanism, and ancillary services provision; as well as all policies with an impact on these, including the Capacity Market and Contracts for Difference.",Exercise Vigilant Fox,Other,Informational,id25_635

The latest number of laboratory confirmed measles cases in England have been published in an updatedepidemiological overviewbyUKHSA.

Since the last update a week ago, a further 86 laboratory confirmed measles cases have been confirmed in England, bringing the total number of cases confirmed since 1 October 2023 to 1109.

The rapid increase in cases seen in late 2023 was initially driven by a large outbreak in Birmingham but activity there has now stabilised and in more recent weeks we have seen a rise in cases in London and smaller clusters ongoing in other regions.

In the 4 weeks since 18 March 2024, there have been 191 laboratory confirmed measles cases. 39.8% of cases were in London (76 of 191), with the West Midlands accounting for a quarter of cases (25.1%, 48 of 191). Around 12% of cases (23 of 191) were in the East Midlands.

Since 1 October, in England there have been 1109 laboratory confirmed measles cases:

48.2% (535 of 1109) of these cases have been in the West Midlands, 24.3% (269 of 1109) in London and 9.5% (105 of 1109) in the East Midlands. The remaining cases were reported in other regions of England.

The majority (706 of 1109, 63.7%) of these cases were in children aged 10 years and under, and 28.8% (319 of 1109) in young people and adults aged 15 years and over.

The data published in this epidemiological overview covers the period between 1 October 2023 and 15 April 2024 and is currently provisional, with the number of cases for the most recent months likely to adjust as more suspected cases undergo confirmatory testing and data cleansing.

Dr Vanessa Saliba,UKHSAConsultant Epidemiologist, said:

Numbers of measles cases are rising across the country, with a particular increase seen in London in recent weeks.

We know some communities in London have very lowMMRvaccination rates. Measles is extremely infectious and it only takes one case to get into these communities for this disease to spread rapidly, especially in schools and nurseries.

TheMMRjab offers the best protection against measles. Measles is preventable but many thousands of children around the country are still not fully vaccinated and may be at risk of serious illness or life-long complications. No parent wants this for their child.

Parents should check their child’s Red Book now to ensure that children are up to date with theMMRand other routine vaccines. If you’re unsure, contact your GP practice to check. Your GP can offer the vaccinations your child needs to bring them up to date. If the NHS contacts you about catching up on missed vaccines, please respond as soon as possible.

Epidemiological updates will continue to be published every Thursday. Data included in this report are provisional and subject to change as more suspected cases undergo confirmatory testing and some locally tested cases are discarded after obtaining further epidemiological information or undergoing confirmatory testing at the reference laboratory.

Since the last update a week ago, there have been a further 89 laboratory confirmed measles cases in England, bringing the total number confirmed since 1 October 2023 to 1023.

Although the ongoing outbreak in the West Midlands initially drove the increase in cases, this week’s data showed that London had the greatest number of new confirmed cases, with smaller clusters ongoing in the East Midlands and the North West.

In the 4 weeks since 11 March 2024, there have been 195 laboratory confirmed measles cases. 69 of these (35%) were reported from London, 62 (32%) from the West Midlands, and 23 (12%) from the East Midlands. Confirmed cases have been reported in all regions during this period.

Since 1 October in England there have been 1023 laboratory confirmed measles cases:

51% (520 of 1023) of these cases have been in the West Midlands, 23% (232 of 1023) in London, and 9% (92 of 1023) in the East Midlands. The remaining cases were reported in other regions of England.

The majority (64%) of these cases were in children aged 10 years and under. 29% were in people aged 15 years and over.

The data published in this epidemiological overview covers the period between 1 October 2023 and 9 April 2024 and is currently provisional, with the number of cases for the most recent months likely to adjust as more suspected cases undergo confirmatory testing and data cleansing.

Dr Rob Verrecchia,UKHSAHealth Protection Consultant, said:

We are continuing to see measles cases right across the country, with cases particularly high in London and the West Midlands. Measles is an extremely infectious disease, and it only takes one case to get into a community with low vaccination rates for measles to spread rapidly, especially in schools and nurseries, so it is vital that people are fully protected by two doses of theMMRvaccine. Measles is completely preventable with vaccination, but many thousands of children around the country are still not fully vaccinated and are at risk of serious illness or life-long complications. That is why our campaign is reminding parents of the importance of ensuring their children are vaccinated.

The latest number of laboratory confirmed measles cases in England have been published in an updatedepidemiological overviewbyUKHSA.

Since the last update a week ago, a further 52 laboratory confirmed measles cases have been confirmed in England. However, due to a routine retrospective data cleaning exercise in week 10 of 2024, 34 previously confirmed cases (since 1 October 2023) have been discarded in addition to 21 cases that had been erroneously reported. This brings the total number of cases confirmed since 1 October 2023 to 730.

Further revisions are expected while we continue to publish timely provisional data on a weekly basis to help monitor the current outbreak.

Although the outbreak in the West Midlands initially drove the increase in cases, activity there is now on a downward trend. In recent weeks, small clusters of cases have emerged in other regions such as London and the North West.

In the 4 weeks since 12 February 2024, there have been 151 laboratory confirmed measles cases.

The data published in this epidemiological overview covers the period between 1 October 2023 and 4 March 2024 and is currently provisional, with the number of cases for the most recent months likely to increase as more suspected cases undergo confirmatory testing.

Dr Vanessa Saliba,UKHSAConsultant Epidemiologist, said:

Worryingly we are continuing to see an increase of measles cases in some areas, most recently in parts of the North-West, where we knowMMRvaccine uptake is low.

Parents are already coming forward to take up the offer of theMMRvaccine for their children, but 100s of thousands of unvaccinated children are at risk of serious illness or life-long complications. The disease spreads very easily among those who are unvaccinated, especially in schools and nurseries, however measles is completely preventable with vaccination.

Our recently launched childhood vaccinations campaign is reminding parents of the importance of getting their children vaccinated on time. Parents can check their child’s Red Book to see they are fully up to date with theirMMRjabs and all their routine vaccines. If any have been missed or if you’re unsure get in touch with your GP practice and respond promptly if the NHS gets in touch for your child to catch up.

The latest number of laboratory confirmed measles cases in England have been published in an updatedepidemiological overviewbyUKHSA.

Since the last update a week ago, a further 60 laboratory confirmed measles cases have been confirmed in England. This brings the total number of cases confirmed since 1 October 2023 to 581.

Although the outbreak in the West Midlands initially drove the increase in cases, clusters of cases in other regions have continued to increase in the past week.

In the 4 weeks since 22 January 2024, there have been 169 laboratory confirmed measles cases. The West Midlands accounted for the majority of these (47%, 79 of 169), mostly in Birmingham, although case numbers in that region appear to be stabilising.

14% (23 of 169) of cases have been in London, 14% (23 of 169) in the North West, 11% in the East Midlands (18 of 169) and 10% (16 of 169) in Yorkshire and the Humber.

Since 1 October in England there have been 581 laboratory confirmed measles cases, 17 cases were reported in October, 42 in November, 159 in December 2023, 266 in January and 97 so far in February 2024. 66% (381 of 581) of these cases have been in the West Midlands, 14% (83 of 581) in London and 7% (43 of 581) in Yorkshire and The Humber. The remaining cases were reported in other regions of England.

The majority (379 of 581, 65%) of these cases are in children under the age of 10 and 27% (154 of 581) in young people and adults over the age of 15.

Dr Vanessa Saliba,UKHSAConsultant Epidemiologist, said:

As expected, due to worryingly lowMMRvaccine uptake in some areas across the country, we are now starting to see clusters of cases in other regions. We’re urging parents to protect their children from this serious illness with theMMRvaccine before it spreads further.

Parents are already coming forward to take up the offer of theMMRvaccine for their children, but 100s of thousands of unvaccinated children are at risk of serious illness or life-long complications. The disease spreads very easily among those who are unvaccinated, especially in schools and nurseries, however measles is completely preventable with vaccination.

Parents should check their child’s Red Book now to ensure that children are fully up to date with both theirMMRjabs and all their routine vaccines. Get in touch with your GP practice to catch up on any that have been missed, or if you’re unsure. Respond as soon as possible if the NHS is in touch for your child to catch up.

Since the last update a week ago, a further 56 laboratory confirmed measles cases have been confirmed in England, compared to 118 cases confirmed in the previous two weeks. This brings the total number of cases confirmed since 1 October 2023 to 521.

Although the initial outbreak in the West Midlands has driven the increase in cases, we are now starting to see clusters of cases in other regions.

In the 4 weeks since 15 January 2024, there have been 166 laboratory confirmed measles cases. The West Midlands accounted for the majority of these (55%, 91 of 166), mostly in Birmingham, although case numbers in that region appear to be stabilising.

12% (20 of 166) of cases have been in London, 10% (17 of 166) in the North West, 10% in Yorkshire and the Humber (16 of 166) and 9% (15 of 166) in the East Midlands.

Since 1 October in England there have been 521 laboratory confirmed measles cases, 17 cases were reported in October, 42 in November, 160 in December 2023, 252 in January and 50 so far in February 2024. 69 % (358 of 521) of these cases have been in the West Midlands, 14 % (71 of 521) in London and 7 % (37 of 521) in Yorkshire and The Humber. The remaining cases were reported in other regions of England.

The majority (343 of 521, 66 %) of these cases are in children under the age of 10 and 25% (133 of 521) in young people and adults over the age of 15.

Dr Vanessa Saliba,UKHSAConsultant Epidemiologist, said:

As expected, due to worryingly lowMMRvaccine uptake in some areas across the country, we are now starting to see clusters of cases in other regions.

While parents are coming forward to take up the offer of theMMRvaccine for their children, there are still 100s of thousands of children who remain unprotected and therefore remain at risk of serious complications or life-long disability.

But measles is completely preventable with vaccination. I strongly urge parents to take up the offer of theMMRvaccine now to make sure their child is protected.

Measles spreads very easily among those who are unvaccinated, especially in nurseries and schools. People in certain groups, including babies, pregnant women, and people with weakened immunity, are at increased risk of complications from measles.

Since the last update a week ago, a further 118 laboratory confirmed measles cases have been confirmed in England, bringing the total number of cases confirmed since 1 October 2023 to 465.

A disproportionately high rate continues to be seen in the West Midlands, with a sharp rise in case numbers over the last 6 weeks, mainly driven by cases in Birmingham.

In England, 17 cases were reported in October, 42 in November, 161 in December, 240 in January 2024 and 5 in February. 71% (329 of 465) of these cases have been in the West Midlands, 13% (62 of 465) in London and 7% (32 of 465) in Yorkshire and The Humber.

Dr Vanessa Saliba,UKHSAConsultant Epidemiologist, said:

The measles outbreak in the West Midlands continues to be a concern.MMRvaccine uptake has been falling over the last decade with 1 out of 10 children starting school in England not protected. Measles is highly infectious and there is a real risk it will spread to other areas.

Parents should be aware that measles is a nasty illness for most children and sadly for some can be very serious and life changing, but it is completely preventable.

Vaccination is the best way to protect yourself and your children. I strongly urge parents to take up the offer as soon as possible and protect their child now.

Dr Vanessa Saliba,UKHSAConsultant Epidemiologist, said:

The ongoing measles outbreak in the West Midlands remains a concern.MMRvaccine coverage has been falling for the last decade with 1 out of 10 children starting school in England not protected and so there is a real risk that this outbreak could spread to other towns and cities.

Measles is a nasty illness for most children and for some can be serious, but it is completely preventable. Vaccination is the best way to protect yourself and your children. If you or your child are not up to date with your two doses ofMMRvaccine please contact your GP to catch-up now.

More than 750 troops from the UK, USA and Finland gathered this week in Niinisalo, western Finland, to participate in the four-day high-readiness exercise. Partner nations practised interoperability between air and land forces ahead of Finland’s accession to NATO. This type of international training is critical in preparing allies to operate alongside one another should NATO need to deploy in the future.

Exercise Vigilant Fox has demonstrated the strength and interoperability of our Armed Forces with our US and Finnish allies and reaffirms our commitment to the defence and security of the Baltic Sea region.

British troopsbased in Estoniaas part ofProject Unified Stanceswooped into Finland in Royal Air Force Chinook helicopters. The troops from C Company, 2 Rifles Battlegroup, were inserted into Niinisalo to join Finland’s high readiness forces from the Jaegar, Karelian and Pori Brigades. The exercise also included soldiers, armoured fighting vehicles and helicopters from the US 3rd Armoured Brigade Combat Team (The Iron Brigade).

Units from all three nations undertook a series of demanding training events, conducting offensive and defensive operations including helicopter assaults, covert landings and short-notice raids using American Black Hawks, Finnish NH-90s and UK Chinooks.

Such training improves integration between air and land forces, as well as interoperability between partner nations, and is crucial to ensuring that NATO forces can work together effectively on operations and in war.

As well as air-land integration, the exercise focused on developing command and control procedures and tactical drills using a combination of live and blank firing drills and urban operations.

Training events like Vigilant Fox are a great opportunity to learn from each other and Finland is most grateful for participation of international partners. For Finland, the exercise is an effective way to demonstrate the competence of our conscripts and to verify and develop the international compatibility of our own troops. The training and exercise activities carried out with close partners, such as the United Kingdom, are a continuation of long-term close cooperation.

Our soldiers, sailors and aviators have received a warm welcome in Finland over the last few months.  Exercise Vigilant Fox is the latest activity in an ongoing series of events across the domains.  As Finland moves towards full NATO Membership, we will continue to seek opportunities like this to show solidarity with Finland, learn from each other and improve our ability to operate together.

This exercise comes just two weeks afterRAF fighter aircraft deployed to Finland and Sweden for joint training.","£300,000 from the UK Integrated Security Fund will be spent on training at the border to counter organised immigration crime and narcotics.",Administrative,,id25_637

The UK will also support Iraq law enforcement to tackle other serious organised crime, including countering narcotics.

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper visited Iraq and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) this week to seal a series of co-operation deals, to tackle shared threats and boost the security of its citizens.

The Home Secretary is the first UK government Secretary of State to visit the country since 2021. She was accompanied by the UK government’s Border Security Commander, Martin Hewitt.

During the 3-day official visit, the Home Secretary spoke to ministers from the Federal Government of Iraq and met ministers in the Kurdistan Regional Government.

As part of the programme the Home Secretary:

Central to the statements agreed today is a commitment from the UK, Iraq and KRI to international and humanitarian law and commitments to international human rights standards.

Today’s announcement represents the biggest operational package to tackle serious organised crime and people smuggling between the 2 countries ever. Smuggling networks operating out of Iraq, including the KRI, and Europe have been responsible for trafficking thousands of people across the globe, including across the Channel to the UK, undermining border security and putting lives at risk.

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said:

These landmark commitments between the UK government and Iraq and the KRI send a clear signal to the criminal smuggling gangs that we are determined to work across the globe to go after them.

There are smuggler gangs profiting from dangerous small boat crossings whose operations stretch back through northern France, Germany, across Europe, to the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and beyond. Organised criminals operate across borders, so law enforcement needs to operate across borders too.

The increasingly global nature of organised immigration crime means that even countries that are thousands of miles apart must work more closely together than ever to stop these gangs getting away with it, to strengthen our border security and to stop so many lives being put at risk.

Our new Border Security Command is already building partnerships across the world to tackle this evil trade in human lives.

I want to thank my hosts for their hospitality. This is an important new partnership between the UK government, Iraq and the KRI to build security and keep people safe.

The joint statement on border security, signed with Federal Government of Iraq Interior Minister Abdulameer Al-Shimmeri, will build on operational work already being conducted between UK law enforcement, including the National Crime Agency, and Iraq.

It sets out a blueprint for both countries to tackle of people smuggling and wider border security issues and pave the way for deeper collaboration in the future. It will include new formal processes for regular engagement.

The statement is backed up by a wider declaration of intent to tackle serious organised crime, which incorporates organised immigration crime, as well as other high harm crimes including drug smuggling, modern slavery and illicit finance. The Home Secretary and representatives in the country also reiterated their drive to continue to work together to counter terrorism.

Some £300,000 from the UK Integrated Security Fund will be spent on training at the border to counter organised immigration crime and narcotics.

On returns, the UK and Iraq have reaffirmed their commitment to enhance co-operation to ensure those who have no right to be in the UK can be returned swiftly, while the UK government will continue to respect international law and protect human rights.

On deterrence communications, the planned campaign will seek to counter disinformation spread by criminal gangs and stop people making the dangerous journey, including telling the real stories of people who have fallen victim to people smuggling gangs.

During the visit, the Home Secretary met with the Federal Government of Iraq Minister of Interior Abdulameer Al-Shimmeri, Prime Minister Mohammed Shia’ Al Sudanl, Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein and Chief Justice Faik Zidan.

In the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, the Home Secretary met with Kurdistan Region President Nechirvan Barzani, Prime Minister Masrour Barzani, Deputy Prime Minister Qubad Talabani and the Interior Minister Rebar Ahmed.

Mr Hewitt met with KRG Director General of the Diwan at the Ministry of Interior, Dr Hemin Mirany.

Border Security Commander Martin Hewitt said:

Enhancing our border security requires international efforts, which is why collaboration with Iraq and the KRI is so important. This work is only going to improve, which means smuggling networks should be on notice that we are coming after you.

As Border Security Commander I will work with law enforcement around the world to break the business model of people smugglers and help save lives.

This international collaboration marks a shift in the UK government’s approach to tackling irregular migration. Through the Border Security Command, the UK are working on a whole system approach to tackling irregular migration, including arming UK law enforcement with the powers it needs, working bilaterally on cross border co-operation and ensuring law enforcement across borders are joined up.

Next month, the UK government will co-host the Calais Group with Germany, in London. The interior ministers of the hosts will be joined by their counterparts from France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, as well as law enforcement, including NCA, Europol and Frontex.

The hospital in Camp Bastion is a permanent structure, so there is no need for medics to be able to set up a tented field hospital in Helmand, but, to keep their skills fresh, the unit decided to set up its tentage during the exercise in Elvington to check it and refamiliarise staff with the layout.

The hospital - one of the smallest layouts - consists of two six-bed wards, two resuscitation bays, an operating theatre, two intensive care beds and an isolation ward. In addition there is also a dental surgery, pathology laboratory and other support services. However, extra wards can be added if needed.

The exercise saw 34 Field Hospital augmented by staff from all three Services from military hospital units across the UK.

For Lieutenant Colonel Tim Davies, this is the last major exercise he will undertake as the Commanding Officer of 34 Field Hospital. He has served in York in various roles and remembers the last time the unit set up a similar tented structure eight years ago. He hands over command next week to Lieutenant Colonel Jaish Mahan.

Lieutenant Colonel Davies, who will shortly be posted to the Defence Academy at Shrivenham, said:

Just as you would check the family tent and equipment before using it, we are doing the same but on a grander scale.

It is important that we maintain the skills of erecting the tentage, perfect the layout, and know how to use the special ruggedised equipment to deliver the world class standards of medical care expected of us.

I was an Officer Commanding the Hospital Squadron when we set up the last field hospital eight years ago, so I have experienced this before.

In terms of this exercise, I have been pleased with the way the reinforcement personnel have worked.

The medics worked through a number of scenarios, and other medical personnel and amputees acted as casualties to test the procedures. The mock casualties arrived on foot, by military ambulance and even on a Lynx military helicopter. The exercise was overseen by directing staff from 2 Medical Brigade, also based in Strensall, and was visited by a number of senior armed forces medical personnel.

Making this commercial hub secure is a priority for Afghan forces in the coming year and has become the main focus for current operations.

Nahr-e Saraj is one of the three districts in Helmand where British troops are deployed - and the last where Task Force Helmand retains the lead for security following the transition of Nad ‘Ali and Lashkar Gah.

Operation ROZI ROSHAN, or ‘Bright Day’, was planned by Afghan National Army staff and led by Brigadier General Sherin Shah, Commander of the 3rd Brigade of 215 Corps.

It is the third major ANA operation in three months and is part of a larger Nahr-e Saraj security plan called Operation SHAMALI KAMARBAND.

Troops from the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) advised Afghan soldiers and headquarters staff throughout the operation, which saw Afghan engineers, advised by sappers from 35 and 38 Engineer Regiments, build six new checkpoints to protect a transit route between Gereshk and the town of Rahim Kalay.

The ANA’s 3/215 Brigade is mentored by 2nd Battalion The Rifles (2 RIFLES), and Riflemen from 2 RIFLES joined their Afghan colleagues on the ground alongside troops from 1st Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, the Queen’s Royal Hussars, the Royal Engineers, and the Danish Army, whose troops are responsible for security in the area.

The soldiers on the ground were also boosted by counter-improvised explosive device teams, search dogs and intelligence and surveillance capabilities.

Afghan warriors reported finding over 40 IEDs and component parts which were destroyed by the ANA’s own bomb disposal specialists - the explosive ordnance disposal operators and explosive hazard reduction teams.

Captain Edward Willing, from 2 RIFLES, said:

This operation was well-planned and executed and has expanded the security bubble north of Gereshk.

This has, yet again, demonstrated the ANA’s ability to conduct large and complex independent operations in conjunction with the Afghan Police with only limited support from ISAF.

Brigadier General Shah said:

The ANSF [Afghan National Security Forces] are ready to provide security for the people of this area.

My message to those who are fighting against our government is to come and join the peace process, as this can be the only solution.

Brigadier Patrick Sanders, the Commander of the British-led Task Force Helmand, said the operation was a vital step towards providing security in the area. He said:

On this occasion the British mentors used a NATO-funded project to provide winter blankets for patrolmen out in the police checkpoints. This project also helped to develop the local economy as the blankets were sourced from the local bazaar in Lashkar Gah.

The PMAG has also been working hard recently on ‘winterisation’ projects across the three districts which it has responsibility for. This has included improving infrastructure in the checkpoints, such as better guard-tower positions and accommodation, and providing shelter for sentries.

Captain Mark Anderson, 1 PWRR, is the logistic mentor to the Afghan Uniform Police Chief of Logistics within the Provincial Police Headquarters in Lashkar Gah. He said:

A large part of my time has been spent on improving infrastructure, which in the short term has meant assisting the Afghan Uniform Police [AUP] in preparing their checkpoints for the onslaught of winter.

The opportunity to mentor such interesting characters in logistics certainly has its challenges, and also its rewards. Playing your part in ensuring that the AUP can sustain themselves throughout the winter and beyond gives you a real sense of achievement.

The security shura meets regularly to discuss the district’s security priorities and the allocation of police and army resources.

Major Rupert King-Evans, Fire Support Company Commander, 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, said:

The operation was to clear insurgents, IED components and IED-making facilities from the Lower Gereshk Valley.

The key point from this operation is that it was an Afghan operation supported by ISAF, and not the other way around. The Afghans planned the operation. We offered advice and, when they requested, we provided support for them.

The task fell to the Afghan National Army (ANA) 3/215 Brigade, led by Brigadier General Sherin Shah. At dawn on the day of the operation, more than 400 Afghan warriors from the brigade flew into the contested area. By conducting several ‘dummy’ landings at various locations, the insurgents were kept on the back foot, and the Afghan forces achieved the element of surprise.

The Afghan warriors, accompanied by their British advisors, patrolled up the valley, clearing the area of insurgents and searching compounds for weapons and ammunition.

Sergeant Major Nathan Love from a Kandak Advisory Training Team said:

The sheer mass of Afghan force on the ground was enough to deter the enemy and show the people that the Afghans are leading. The Taliban saw this and most of them decided not to fight, so the ANA were able to find 14 of their IEDs.

For the Afghan soldiers searching the area and keeping the local residents safe, it was a point of pride to be leading a major operation.

Jawid Afghanyar, an ANA officer with the 6th Kandak, 3/215 Brigade, said:

We have mine-defusing teams, infantry teams and many others bringing security and peace to the area. It has been a while since the Afghan National Security Forces have been in the area and the people now know that we will help make this area safe and secure, so the people here can continue their work in peace.

The British soldiers involved in mentoring the Afghan forces have seen them rise to a very high level of expertise.

Major King-Evans concluded:

It’s seriously impressive how well the Afghan Army is operating. They are really swept up. Their low-level tactics, skills and drills are excellent, and they conducted the operation almost as if they were ISAF themselves.

They’ve shown the local population that the Government of Afghanistan and the Afghan National Army and Police are here to stay.","£33.1m for the development of the Afghan National Police in 2010/11, including building seven police stations in addition to the two UK-funded police stations opened in Helmand last month, and £135m to double the numbers of Reaper Remotely Piloted Aircraft.",Welfare,,id25_643

The PSOM had previously been used in support of HQ Allied Rapid Reaction Corps Exercise Arcade Fusion in 2009.

Colin Marston, team leader and a senior analyst for a stabilisation study working for Dstl, describes the PSOM as a computer programme designed to bring together different human elements and inputs and return various outcomes that planners can then use to further sync plans and operations.

The team from Dstl, which were all volunteers, delivered the PSOM during a week-long conference held in Kabul’s International Airport. It brought together over 150 key personnel from across Afghanistan to discuss and plan for operations there from now through the next winter.

German Army Major Duncan Kohl said:

We have pulled together the strategic, operational and tactical level planners, along with support from external civilian agencies, embassies and elements from the Afghan National Security Forces [ANSF], to co-ordinate and synchronise our efforts for the future.

The PSOM helped give conference members clear direction for the future planning of operations and allowed ISAF Joint Command cross-functional planning teams to utilise the output from the week to have a greater effect on operations in Afghanistan.

British Army Colonel Gary Deakin said the week was designed to look at how plans have worked in the past and apply those lessons to making plans for the future. The week included discussions about past and future operations and touched on the ANSF role in reaching mission successes in the coming months. He said:

We are getting all the people together that need to be here, to talk through what’s required to be done, and most importantly discussing this with our Afghan partners so we can get everyone working together.

While the conference is not the first of its kind, it’s the first one that utilised the Dstl’s PSOM computer system in Afghanistan:

These improvements to essential infrastructure, in addition to more resources for training, will help the Afghan National Police appear both more visible and more professional to the Afghan population, enabling them to carry out their role more effectively.

The Prime Minister travelled to the main operating base at Lashkar Gah for a briefing by Commander Task Force Helmand, Brigadier James Chiswell, and on the progress made by the Provincial Reconstruction Team to drive social, economic and political development in the area.

The Prime Minister also inspected the new Warthog armoured vehicle, which is now operational in Afghanistan, meeting soldiers who crew and maintain the armoured vehicle, which is replacing the Viking vehicle in Afghanistan.

Able to operate in the most diverse and demanding environments - including moving through water, climbing steep slopes and crossing drainage ditches - this tracked vehicle provides troops with high levels of protection whilst giving commanders the flexibility to operate in areas where the terrain and local infrastructure mean a more agile vehicle is needed.

The doubling of the numbers of Reaper aircraft means troops will also benefit from increased support to ground operations from the air. Reaper provides live, detailed images of the area in which troops are operating, 24-hours-a-day, allowing commanders on the ground to make more informed and effective decisions to defeat the enemy.

Uniquely for this type of aircraft, Reaper is also armed. It has already proved successful in helping to both detect and destroy enemy targets and IED networks in Afghanistan.

The Prime Minister said:

As Christmas approaches, I know the thoughts will be of home and of loved ones; I would like personally to thank everyone serving in Afghanistan for the sacrifice they are making. I say to them, it is great work you are doing and we must continue to do all we can to help you endure.

This is my sixth visit to Afghanistan, to Helmand province, and my second this year - and what I see is some grounds for cautious optimism. The amount of ground that’s covered by the forces is up, the amount of markets that are open, the number of provincial and district governors that are in place, the number of schools that are open, the level of security - there are lots of signs of positive improvement.

Defence Secretary Dr Liam Fox said:

I’m delighted that Warthog is proving so successful on operations. Robust and agile, it is a valuable addition to the range of vehicles already available to commanders on the ground, giving them both flexibility and high levels of protection on operations.

In addition, the significant increase in air surveillance will mean commanders are equipped with the best information possible when deciding how best to defeat the enemy. This significant increase in resources demonstrates our commitment to ensuring front line troops have the world class equipment they need to help combat the threat of IEDs.

Corporal Tristan ‘Tiny’ Cordery, aged 35, from Fowey in Cornwall, is a veteran of two tours of Iraq and one of Kosovo, and has previously served in Afghanistan. He has now returned to Afghanistan as a Warthog commander with the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment:

I’m excited about using the new Warthog vehicle - we can use Warthog to get where other vehicles cannot go. We can choose between the heavy, grenade or general purpose machine guns. This gives me, as the Warthog commander, the flexibility to tailor my armament to the mission - and that’s a vital capability in order to succeed in the complicated environment of Afghanistan.

With this firepower comes good armour. The Warthog can take rocket-propelled grenade hits, machine gun fire and has better protection from IEDs. This combination of firepower and protection is what us Tankies are looking for in a vehicle.",Creation of comparable UK trade marks and re-registered UK designs,Legislative,,id25_645
646,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/human-rights-convention-does-not-apply-to-military-on-overseas-operations,News story,Human Rights Convention does not apply to military on overseas operations,The Supreme Court has ruled today that Article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) does not extend to members of the UK Armed Forces carrying out military duties abroad outside of UK bases.,Ministry of Defence,30 June 2010,"The judgment follows an appeal by the MOD following the case brought by Mrs Catherine Smith, mother of Private Jason Smith, a reservist who sadly died of hyperthermia while based at a British camp in southern Iraq in 2003.

Mrs Smith contended that her son’s right to life had been breached by the failure of the Government to take steps to prevent his death and that his inquest did not meet the standard of investigation required by Article 2 (right to life) of the ECHR.

Mrs Smith won her case at the High Court and the Court of Appeal. The MOD lodged an appeal to the Supreme Court on two points:

The point of jurisdiction (Article 1 of the ECHR) - whether soldiers serving overseas and outside British bases come within the scope of the ECHR, which would potentially have meant that military decisions made in the course of those operations could subsequently be challenged in the courts on human rights’ grounds.

The inquest point (Article 2 of the ECHR) - whether it is obligatory to hold a full investigative inquest where there is a death of a member of the Armed Forces abroad and for inquests to be compliant with human rights legislation.

The Supreme Court (by majority decisions) agreed today, Wednesday 30 June 2010, with the Ministry of Defence on the first question but upheld the previous ruling of the Court of Appeal on the second.

This judgment upholds the MOD’s position that the decision of commanders on the ground in operational situations should not be subject to scrutiny by the courts for compliance with the European Convention.

In the judgment, the Supreme Court judge Lord Collins said:

It is hardly conceivable that in 1950 the framers of the Convention would have intended the Convention to apply to the Armed Forces of Council of Europe states engaged in operations … outside the contracting states.

[Paragraph 303 of the judgment.]

Lord Hope said:

It is one thing, therefore, to recognise a Member State’s jurisdiction over persons within an area beyond the frontiers of the Member State over which their Armed Forces have established total and exclusive de facto control such as a military base, a military hospital or a detention centre … It is quite another to extend that jurisdiction to areas outside premises of that kind over which the Armed Forces may be operating but over which they do not have exclusive control.

[Paragraph 92 of the judgment.]

The Court did not agree however with the MOD’s argument that a full investigative inquest was not obligatory in every case where the death of a member of the Armed Forces abroad has occurred.

The MOD readily accepts this second part of the ruling, welcoming the clarification given by the Court.

The MOD does not believe this will change the existing procedure on inquests where coroners have discretion as to the scope of the inquest they can carry out.

This judgment means that where there are grounds to believe there has been a systemic failure by the state, then it would be normal for the coroner to carry out a full ECHR-compliant inquest.

Commenting on the ruling, the Chief of the Defence Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, said:

I am pleased that the Supreme Court has upheld the Government’s appeal. This outcome is not about denying rights to our people, it is about ensuring that we have a clear and workable set of rules under which they can carry out their demanding and dangerous work.

Within that context, commanders at all levels are committed to the safety of the men and women they lead. We will continue to do everything we can to keep our people from harm by providing the best possible equipment and training.

My sympathies remain with Mrs Smith and her family, whose son - Private Jason Smith - sadly died from heat-stroke inside a base in Iraq.

The Defence Secretary, Dr Liam Fox, said:

Providing our forces on operations with the very best support and equipment is a fundamental responsibility of Government, not an obligation that must be created by any law. That is why we have promised to repair the military covenant and I am committed to ensuring we do all we can for our brave personnel who put their lives on the line for our national security.

Common sense has prevailed and it is of course right that commanders’ orders given in the heat of battle should not be questioned by lawyers at a later date. It would have been absurd to try to apply the same legal considerations on the battlefield that exist in non-combat situations.",Defence Diving School Courses,Institutional,,id25_646

On 1 January 2021 there will be changes to UK intellectual property law to ensure the smooth departure fromEUIPsystems.

The following is a summary of the key changes.

From 1 January 2021, UK attorneys will be unable to represent clients on new applications or new proceedings at theEUIntellectual Property Office (EUIPO). UK trade mark owners will need to appoint anEEAattorney to represent them on new applications and proceedings before theEUIPO.

However, the Withdrawal Agreement (WA) ensures that UK legal representatives can continue to represent their clients before theEUIPOin cases that are ongoing at the end of the transition period.

From the end of the transition period, theIPOwill no longer provide certification for legal representatives to be added toEUIPO’s list of professional representatives. TheEUIPOwill no longer introduce representatives to the list on the basis of a UK certification.

The Intellectual Property Office (IPO) has publishedbusiness guidance, following publication of the government response to the outcome of theAddress for Service call for viewspublished earlier this year. Views were invited on removing reference to the European Economic Area.

From 1 January 2021, subject to legislative implementation, only an address for service in the UK (which for these purposes includes the Isle of Man), Gibraltar or the Channel Islands will be accepted for new applications and new requests to start contentious proceedings before theIPO.

The change will apply across all the registeredIPrights (patents, trade marks and designs).

Comparable UK trade mark and Design rights were created at the end of the transition period under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement.

On 1 January 2021, TheIPOcreated a comparable UK trade mark for every registeredEUtrade mark (EUTM). Each of these UK rights will:

You will not:

Businesses, organisations or individuals that had applications for EUTMs that were not registered at the end of the transition period had a period of nine months to apply in the UK for the same protection. In these cases, UK application fees were payable, and the application was subject to UK examination and publication requirements.

Our digital and paper forms were amended to include a new section for claiming the earlier filing date of the correspondingEUTMapplication.

International trade marks and designs designating theEUwill continue to have protection in the UK under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement.

On 1 January 2021, the UK Intellectual Property Office created a comparable UK trade mark and  re-registered UK design for every International (EU) trade mark and design , that was  protected at the end of the transition period.

Where an international design designating theEUwas applied for, but  was not  protected, or where the publication had been deferred, the holder had a period of nine months to apply for the same right as a UK design.

A provision also exists for international (EU) trade marks.

For information on renewals, opt out process and numbering please refer to UKIPOtrade mark business guidanceanddesigns business guidance.

For further key information for customers and users ofIPabout how theIPsystem and the UK Intellectual Property Office will operate after theend of the transition period.

Unregistered community designs that arise before the end of the transition period will continue to be protected in the UK for the remainder of their three year term through continuing unregistered designs.

From 1 January 2021, a  supplementary unregistered design (SUD) will become available in UK law.

TheSUDwill provide similar protection to that conferred by the unregistered Community design, but for the UK only.

TheSUDwill be established by first disclosure in the UK or another qualifying country.
First disclosure in theEUwill not establish aSUDright. It could destroy the novelty of the design should you later seek to establish UK unregistered rights.

Business will need to consider carefully where to disclose their products to ensure they have adequate protection in their most important market.

More information is available in ourbusiness guidance.

You can apply for a European patent through us or direct to the European Patent Office (EPO) to protect your patent in more than 30 countries in Europe, using the (non-EU) European Patent Convention (EPC).

As theEPOis not anEUagency, leaving theEUdoes not affect the current European patent system. Existing European patents covering the UK are also unaffected.

European patent attorneys based in the UK continue to be able to represent applicants before theEPO. See the notice on theEPOwebsitenews storyfor further information.

SPCsare granted as national rather thanEU-wide rights.

It was not necessary for the UK and theEUto agree the creation of a comparable right to ensure continued protection of existingSPCsin the UK at the end of the transition period.

The Withdrawal Agreement ensures thatSPCapplications which are pending at the end of the transition period will be examined under the current framework.

AnySPCwhich is granted based on those applications will provide the same protection as existingSPCs.

You will continue to apply for anSPCby submitting an application to the Intellectual Property Office.

Due to regulatory changes for marketing authorisations there are some changes to theSPCapplication process which will come into effect from 1 January.

You will need to check whether your marketing authorisation is valid for the whole of the UK, or just Northern Ireland or Great Britain.

An application for anSPCmust still be filed with theIPOwithin six months of your first authorisation.

Please check thebusiness guidanceto ensure you are submitting the correct forms and accompanying documentation.

TheIPrights in goods placed on the UK market by, or with the consent of the right holder after the transition period may no longer be considered exhausted in theEEA.

This means that businesses parallel exporting theseIP-protected goods from the UK to theEEAmight need the right holder’s consent.

TheIPrights in goods placed on theEEAmarket by, or with the consent of the right holder after the transition period will continue to be considered exhausted in the UK.

This means that parallel imports into the UK from theEEAwill be unaffected.

The UK government is currently considering what the UK’s futureIPexhaustion regime should be. The government ran a consultation for 12 weeks from June to August 2021 and is now carefully considering consultation responses. Once the analysis of consultation responses is complete, the government will make a decision and choose the option which best serves the UK economy, the UK public and the UK as a whole. We are aware that many businesses and consumers are interested on this matter so when that decision is made, we will work as quickly as possible to make an announcement.

Check whether you currently export legitimate,IP-protected goods to theEEA. These could be goods branded with a trade mark that have already been placed on the UK market.

The rights holder’s permission to export those goods may not currently be required.

You may need to contact the rights holder to get permission to continue exporting these goods after 1 January 2021.

TheIPrights holder may not provide permission for theirIP-protected goods to be parallel exported to theEEA.

You may need to review your business arrangements, business model or supply chain based on the outcome of the discussion with theIPrights holder.

Businesses that ownIPrights (trade marks, patents, designs or copyright) may wish to seek legal advice if theirIP-protected goods are parallel exported from the UK to theEEA.

You will need to consider if you want to allow parallel exports of yourIP-protected goods from the UK to theEEAafter 1 January 2021.

Most UK copyright works (such as books, films and music) will still be protected in theEUand the UK. This is because of the UK’s continued participation in the international treaties on copyright.

For the same reason,EUcopyright works will continue to be protected in the UK. This applies to works made before and after 1 January 2021.

However, certain cross-border copyright arrangements that are unique toEUmember states no longer apply to the UK.

These include cross-border portability of online content services, copyright clearance for satellite broadcasts, reciprocal protection for database rights and the orphan works exception.

The effect of this change on UK copyright works and related services may vary and will depend on domestic legislation in eachEUstate as well as private contractual relationships.

More information is available in ourbusiness guidance.

A geographical indication is anIPright used on products that have a specific geographical origin. They possess qualities or a reputation due to that origin, such as Scotch Whisky or Stilton cheese.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) leads on agricultural and food Geographical Indications (GIs) in the UK. They havepublished guidance, including on the new UKGIschemes which will come into force on 1 January 2021.

TheIPOhas worked withDefrato ensure the new schemes are compatible with the widerIPframework. This will ensure the existing relationship between trade marks andGIsis maintained.  More information is available in ourbusiness guidance.

The way in which businesses protect theirIPrights at the UK border will change once the Transition Period ends on 31 December 2020. From this date all UK protection within theEUwill cease to be recognised.

648,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/diving-with-the-sappers,News story,Diving with the sappers,A group of highly specialised soldiers - Royal Engineer divers - have been honing their skills on a six-week advanced diver course at the National Diving and Activity Centre in Chepstow.,Ministry of Defence,12 August 2011,"ith ever-increasing demands being placed on the Army’s impressive arsenal of manpower, there has never been a greater need for personnel to excel in a variety of tasks.

While ‘soldier first’ remains the mantra for all servicemen and women in the British Army, their trades and secondary roles also play a key part in the success of operations and exercises around the world.

For Royal Engineer divers there is no exception to this rule, and these highly-skilled sappers have proved themselves to be the very definition of a flexible force.

Their ability to plummet to depths of up to 50 metres and carry out assignments ranging from vehicle recoveries to demolition work is impressive enough, but this is merely an accompaniment to their day jobs.

As well as proving their worth as divers, they have primary trades to focus on, along with their commitments as soldiers, meaning they have a three-pronged approach to their busy Army careers.

To earn a place in the water at the National Diving and Activity Centre in Chepstow, candidates must pass a selection phase and then complete a basic diving course before moving onto a challenging advanced programme.

This six-week schedule helps personnel master the open space diving system as well as teaching them how to operate key tools such as hydraulic cutters, breaking equipment and thermal cutting systems. They also learn a host of new skills including underwater concreting and advanced reconnaissance, which can be used to locate submerged vehicles in theatre. Captain Steve Crosby-Jones, Royal Engineers, the diving officer who co-ordinates serials for the basic and advanced courses explained:

We are not full-time divers. As well as completing their training they will still be sappers on the ground. They can be used for their recovery capability but it is a secondary trade.

In theatre, the diving teams have been doing a variety of work. This includes body recoveries, the salvage of weapons from the bottom of wells or canals and underwater demolition tasks.

They are a team and asset that are crucial to operations, especially when guys lose equipment such as rifles and radios; there is no other capability that can recover that kit.

While divers have proved to be a valuable resource in theatre, they are not deployed in this role alone:

Diving is very much an ‘as and when’ resource,” the officer said. “Some operational tours will inevitably have more serials than others.

But every theatre we have been to - Iraq, Northern Ireland, the Balkans - divers have been used. It is a capability that is there and, if we take it away, we will never get it back.

The Defence Diving School runs four basic and two advanced courses a year and there is healthy competition for places.

As well as being open to the Royal Engineers, the programme welcomes troops from 17 Port and Maritime Regiment, Royal Logistic Corps:

It definitely builds their teamwork. If they do not work as a group they will not pass. We do not have any problems when the guys come back for the advanced course. When they leave they are fully qualified and they are here because they want to be.

Once they have completed their training the soldiers go back to their regiments and join diving teams, where they pass on the knowledge they have gained. They also have the option of returning to complete a diving supervisors’ course.

Trainee Lance Corporal Daniel Brown, Royal Engineers, has been determined to make the most of the opportunities available and has set his sights on further progress in the future:

Since I did my basic course I have stayed in the diving world. After passing that, all I have done is dive,” he said.

I would never have got into this if it had not been for the Army. As I went through my training I heard stories about how difficult this course was and that made me want to sign up.

It took me quite a while to get a place as it is so popular. At my last unit there were a lot of fit guys who were keen to try this kind of thing. I was one of the lucky ones who got on it.

My next step is to do the supervisors’ course and if possible I would like to come back to the school to work as part of the support staff.

For Lance Corporal Dylan Jones, Royal Engineers, life below the surface has provided welcome variety from his day job as a carpenter and joiner:

It is just something I fancied doing. The money [specialist pay] is an incentive but it is another string to my bow.

The basic stage was fast and furious but this has been quite good. There is a lot to learn but it is a relaxed environment to work in.

He now feels fully prepared to put his skills into practice in Afghanistan, if the call comes:

It is something we have trained for. You don’t want to be going in to pick up a body, but it is a possibility. I am confident I could go out there and get the job done. This is fantastic training and I am pleased to have gone down the diving route.",Deployment of HMS Westminster to patrol the Bay of Sirte and enforce UNSCR 1973.,Institutional,Other,id25_648

The visitors were briefed by Brigadier Richard Felton, the Commander of Task Force Helmand, and by Lindy Cameron, the Head of the Provincial Reconstruction Team, before meeting Service personnel based in Lashkar Gah.

Captain Stuart Thomas of 204 Signal Squadron said:

It’s a great show of support for the three Ministers to come out so shortly after the election and it was great to hear them speak passionately about our achievements in Afghanistan.

Liam Fox was keen to find out what life is like for us here and our relationship with the Afghan security forces, which is improving all the time.

All three Ministers addressed the assembled Service and civilian personnel and praised their courage and dedication to the mission in Afghanistan.

Dr Fox said:

I will give you my promise that we will do everything we can to ensure that, whatever you are asked to do, you are properly, fully equipped to do so, to maximise your chance of success and minimise the risk to you.

Mr Hague paid tribute to the progress which has been made in Helmand, saying he was ‘full of admiration’ for the work being done. He said:

It’s very encouraging for all of us who have been here 18 months or two years ago to see the enormous progress that’s been made thanks to your incredible hard work.

The difference over that period, the difference in governance, the difference in freedom of movement, the difference in protecting communities, is colossal. And a lot of that progress has been made in the last few months. We want to thank you for all that hard work.

Many soldiers were keen to know about the promised doubling of operational bonuses. The Defence Secretary said that after discussions with the Treasury, the new Government will be sticking to the pledge and details of the increase will be announced in next month’s Budget.

While in Lashkar Gah yesterday, Dr Fox was interviewed on Sky News Sunday Live by Adam Boulton, when he said:

I’ve been here five or six times now over the last few years. There’s no doubt that where we are in Lashkar Gah, things are considerably better than when I last visited, that there is more freedom of movement; we’ve seen local bazaars opening up with shopkeepers able to stock up, local people able to buy things, so clearly there are areas where there has been substantial improvement.

Some areas are further behind in terms of regaining and holding ground, so we have to give our Forces time and General McChrystal’s strategy time to feed through. But certainly there are some signs that make me feel optimistic, although clearly there’s still a long way to go, but I think that we do need to remember, and I’ve been making at every stop that I’ve had here the same point, which is that we are in Afghanistan for reasons of Britain’s national security.

We don’t want Afghanistan to roll back to being a failed state from which terrorist campaigns can be designed and launched, nor do we want to see the destabilisation of Pakistan next door. There are big regional security questions as well as national security questions for the UK.

On the reasons for British military involvement in Afghanistan Dr Fox added:

The primary reason why we’re in Afghanistan is a national security imperative. We had to break the grip that Al-Qaeda had on this country; we have to stop the Taliban coming back and giving help to other terrorist groupings.

It’s of course clear that if we want a stable and prosperous Afghanistan in the longer term, we need to be investing in this country, we need to be ensuring that there is prosperity, better governance, better human rights, all of these things.

It will take a long time and they’re part of a different if complementary international mission that will have to continue for a long time after our Armed Forces have left here.

Asked how long he thinks it will be before Armed Forces can leave Afghanistan, Dr Fox replied:

General McChrystal’s made very clear in his strategy that the whole point now is to get the Afghan National Security Forces able to deal with their own internal and external security without reference to the international coalition. That’s moving on apace.

I’ve this morning been talking to some of our own troops who’ve been training the Afghan forces. I’ve met some of the Afghan forces themselves and they’ve come on a long way from some of my previous visits. But it’s still going to take some time to get the numbers and the quality up.

General McChrystal talks about 2014 as being a reasonable target for when we might get those sort of numbers and quality to a level where we might be able to transition to them having the overall role of security in this country.

That seems perfectly attainable, but clearly to think about bringing our Forces out before we’ve completed our task would be wrong. But against that, we have to ensure that we’re not keeping our troops here for any longer than absolutely necessary and I think that everybody in the United Kingdom will want to see our Forces back as soon as we could once they had completed the task we’ve set for them.

Dr Fox added that Helmand is one of the more difficult parts of Afghanistan and it’s probably one of the last places where there will be an overall transition to Afghan forces. He added:

I think we need to be very realistic with the British people about the state of the mission. I intend to give regular statements to Parliament showing both sides of the ledger, the problems we face, but the successes our Armed Forces are having, and I think that’s necessary if we’re to maintain broad public support for our Armed Forces.

When I spoke to an assembly of our troops earlier today, it was very clear that they wanted the public to support them, not just for being members of the Armed Forces, but for carrying out a mission which they believed was right for the security of the people of Britain. I applaud them in that and I hope that we can continue to build public support for them.","Construction of a new Welfare Centre at Woolwich Station, the re-development of RAF Uxbridge","Welfare (grants, benefits, subsidies)",,id25_649

Early on she provided some support to the non-combatant evacuation operations and has subsequently been patrolling in the Bay of Sirte, reporting the activities on the ground and in the air back to the UK authorities. In both the reporting of intelligence and as a demonstration of the UK Government’s commitment to this region she has played an important role.

Now that military action has been taken in support of UNSCR 1973, HMS Westminster is continuing to report the situation back to the UK, and is prepared for tasking to support any humanitarian or embargo operations that may be required.

She is playing an important role in deterring Colonel Gaddafi’s navy from conducting attacks against the Libyan people. Before UN Security Council Resolution 1973, their gunboats shelled a number of the coastal towns, but with Westminster, HMS Cumberland and HMS Triumph patrolling the coastal waters, there has been a very marked reluctance on the part of the Libyan Navy to venture forth since the start of the enforcement action.

HMS Westminster expects to remain engaged in a dynamic and evolving operational situation for the foreseeable future.

Commander Tim Green, HMS Westminster’s Commanding Officer, said:

We have switched quickly from official ceremonies in London to operational circumstances off Libya in very short order and with the minimum of fuss. Having assisted in non-combatant evacuation operations we are now guarding the maritime flank, protecting the Libyan people from Gaddafi’s aggression.

We are ready for combat, embargo or humanitarian operations at immediate notice. This is what the Royal Navy does and my ship and people have stepped up to the mark brilliantly.

As the Commanding Officer was speaking, the ship’s helicopter was airborne conducting maritime patrol operations, exerting the Royal Navy’s sea control over the area.

HMS Westminster also has a detachment of Royal Marines embarked ready to assist in maritime security operations, augmenting the ship’s own board and search capabilities, and is ready to enforce embargo operations in support of UNSCR 1973.",Increase to awards paid for injuries due to service,Welfare,Financial Incentives,id25_650

The scheme pays a tax-free lump sum for injuries due to service, with the most seriously injured given a tax-free, index-linked Guaranteed Income Payment for life. This payment will be increased under the current changes to better reflect the lasting impact of injuries on future likely promotions and on the ability to work up to age 65.

Other changes include:

• an increase, which averages in excess of 25 per cent, to all lump sum award payments - except the top award which was recently doubled to £570,000

• nearly tripling the maximum award for mental illness from £48,875 to £140,000 in order to accurately reflect the impact of the most serious mental health conditions

• the creation of a new independent medical expert group to advise on compensation for specific, relevant illnesses and injuries such as hearing loss and mental health

• a revised approach to awarding compensation for multiple injuries, whereby all injuries sustained will receive some compensation.

The changes are detailed in ‘The Review of the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme - One Year On’ report which can be found at Related Links.

All personnel who have already received an award under the scheme since its introduction in 2005 will have their case automatically revisited and will receive an uplift based on the new award levels.

The AFCS Review was assisted by an independent scrutiny group that included Service charities, medical experts, serving personnel and veterans and announced its recommendations for improvements in February 2010.

Since that date the MOD has been working to draft and introduce the legislation required to bring the changes into force.

Andrew Robathan, Minister for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans, said:

I am determined to ensure the care and support we give both our injured Service personnel and our veterans is the best possible. These changes show the Government’s commitment to helping our wounded and will result in a significant uplift for many who have already claimed, as well as all future claimants.

Crucially, nobody will lose out as a result of these changes - indeed, nearly all will receive an uplift to the amount they received.",Theatre Royal Haymarket Masterclass Trust Project (using acting and theatre to boost confidence and help servicemen and women back on the road to recovery),Welfare,Informational,id25_652

The highly-equipped Sandown Class ship is off to join a NATO task force carrying out mine countermeasures exercises and operations in both the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.

Hunt Class minehunter HMS Ledbury and her ship’s company of 42 sailed in early January. Since then Ledbury has clocked up 12,000 nautical miles (22,224km), and has spent her time operating with NATO’s permanent mine countermeasures group, assisting with the task of clearing the Mediterranean of historic ordnance left from the World Wars and more recent conflicts, and conducting a series of exercises.

See Related News to read more on HMS Ledbury’s Mediterranean deployment.

The ship and her crew have sailed around most of the Mediterranean in their six-month deployment, visiting 18 ports in eight countries including Malta, Sicily, Croatia, Spain, Portugal and Italy. There were also two visits to key North African countries as part of NATO’s role in the Mediterranean.

During recent training off the coast of Sardinia, HMS Ledbury worked with Italian counterparts to destroy a live Second World War German sea mine that had been spotted by Ledbury’s skilled operators using the ship’s sophisticated sonar at a depth of 43 metres. The ship’s remote-controlled mini submarine Seafox was used to beam live video back to the ship, enabling mine clearance divers to detonate the aged ordnance safely.

Lieutenant Commander Tony Williams, Commanding Officer of HMS Ledbury, said:

I am very proud of the efforts of my crew, who have unrelentingly displayed their professionalism and fortitude from the moment we started preparing for this deployment over a year ago.

The deployment has been challenging but very rewarding and I am particularly proud of my team’s efforts in finding and destroying the mine off Sardinia.

My crew and I would like to thank all those who have supported us during this deployment and we are all very glad to be home with our families after such a long time away.

Lieutenant Hamish Maxwell, Navigating Officer on HMS Blyth, said:

The Mediterranean provides a testing and different environment to what the ship’s company have experienced in Scotland, which makes it an ideal location for us to develop our capabilities.

654,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/troops-take-to-the-west-end-stage,News story,Troops take to the West End stage,"A remarkable group of wounded, sick and injured Service personnel will star on the West End stage this weekend.",Ministry of Defence,20 January 2012,"They’ve all suffered brutal or life-threatening injuries, but a group of servicemen and women who paid a terrible price serving in Britain’s Armed Forces are back firmly on the road to recovery, thanks to a theatre in the West End.

‘The Two Worlds of Charlie F’ is a Service person’s view of injury and recovery. The play explores the consequences of both physical and psychological wounds, and the impact on others during the fight to win the new battle for survival at home while coming to terms with the cards that life has dealt.

Writer Owen Sheers interviewed each member of the newly-formed Bravo 22 Company and wrote his script by weaving in the personal experiences of the wounded, sick and injured troops who play theatricalised characters based on them. The result is a darkly comic, authentic and richly uplifting tale of survival.

One serviceman involved in the groundbreaking initiative is Marine Cassidy Little, 30, who lost his lower right leg when he was caught in an IED blast while on foot patrol in the Nad ‘Ali district of Helmand province, Afghanistan, last summer.

Marine Little, a Canadian, who serves with 42 Commando Royal Marines, joined the Armed Forces as a challenge after leaving university in the US and moving to London. In the aftermath of the bomb blast, he told a young medic treating him, with gallows humour:

There goes my dancing years!

About a month into his recuperation at Headley Court, the Marine learned about the Theatre Royal Haymarket Masterclass Trust and their first project to work with wounded military personnel.

Marine Little said:

I got involved because I thought it would be a good laugh and it’s a distraction, because if I focus on the fact that my whole life has changed, it’s difficult. I’ve had setbacks here and there but they don’t seem as drastic as if I hadn’t got this.

The Marine was instantly drawn to the Bravo 22 Company project because he always had a lust for the stage. Talented and gregarious, he landed the star role of Charlie Fowler after pouring out his story to Owen Sheers ‘for about three hours’, and the writer instinctively knew he’d found his leading man.

About a dozen servicemen will act while others have designed the set, made costumes, and will man the sound and lighting equipment and help backstage.

Marine Little said:

When I got the final script before Christmas, I was like ‘Holy Smokes!’

But the self-assured Marine never once doubted his ability to pull it off:

I’m more than happy to jump in the deep end of just about any situation,” he said with obvious pride.

Marine Little firmly believes that the opportunity to act at the Theatre Royal Haymarket has provided a distraction that has been invaluable for his recovery:

You need it. Some people get distracted by their Xbox, unfortunately some people get distracted by medication or alcohol - we all look for distraction because nobody wants to sit down and stare at their stump.

Heart-warmingly, he thinks that the lure of the spotlight has provided the best medicine of all. Ask if there are any similarities between the world of acting and the military and Marine Little nods:

Huge. The director is the CO [Commanding Officer], the producer is the RSM [Regimental Sergeant Major], the stage manager is the OC [Officer Commanding], and the writer is the padre and provides guidance!

Early on, Bravo 22 Company were taken under the wing of Theatre Royal Haymarket’s artistic director, Sir Trevor Nunn, and patron, actor Ray Winstone, who, according to Marine Little, was a revelation:

Ray was absolutely brilliant,” he said. “I thought that coming into a room full of soldiers, he’d be playing the hard bloke - but he was incredibly kind and supportive and it mattered nothing that he was Ray Winstone and I was Cassidy Little.

We stood on the same stage and sat on the same couch,” he added, sounding a little star-struck.

On Sunday 22 January 2012, the troops will perform their play at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in central London over two back-to-back performances. Marine Little’s huge extended family will be flying over to support him, but ask him if he has any nerves and his composure slips a little:

Terrified!” he admits with a grin.

The Theatre Royal Haymarket Masterclass Trust teamed up with the Royal British Legion and the Defence Recovery Capability to put the project together and all proceeds will go to the Royal British Legion.

The project aims to use acting and theatre to boost confidence and help the servicemen and women back on the road to recovery.

The play was sparked by a brainwave of producer Alice Driver who wanted to stage a play that would draw individuals out of their recovery bubble, boost self-esteem and pull people out of their comfort zone.

With just 48 hours until curtain up, Alice feels ‘hugely emotional’ at the transformation of the novice actors into accomplished performers:

It’s going to be amazing and everyone will see what I believe is a brilliant piece of theatre,” she said. “But what makes it even more exciting is that the troops are performing their own stories which makes it even more powerful.

However, she points out that it has taken a lot of effort to turn the idea into reality:

It’s been a huge challenge,” said Alice, who worked hard to persuade the Defence Recovery Capability and Commanding Officers from the Personnel Recovery Units that acting ‘wasn’t an airy-fairy therapy’.

She also says that one soldier likened rehearsals to assembling a gun or a drill:

He told me ‘you just keep on doing it until it is perfect’.

Captain Anna Poole serves with 15 (North East) Brigade based at Catterick Garrison. She served on operations in Iraq in 2003/04 but her career was cut short when she was injured in Latvia in late 2005 competing in a luge (feet first down the bobsleigh track at breakneck speeds) for the Army and Great Britain.

Captain Poole’s injury eventually led to the amputation of her left leg last June - ‘the best decision I ever made’ - and she began studying for a degree while she recovered:

Sitting at home is a very difficult thing to do,” she said with admirable frankness. “You just stare at four walls and it’s very difficult to get motivated so going out and meeting people while coming to terms with injury is a real confidence boost.

Captain Poole’s Personnel Recovery Unit suggested that she get involved with Bravo 22 Company and now she has put her studies on hold to concentrate on rehabilitation:

You’ve got to get it right first time otherwise you’re stuck with bad habits for life,” she explained.

Captain Poole plays Army Captain Becky Robinson who loses a leg (albeit in a mine strike), which should be a walk in the park for such a ballsy young woman. The writer lent on the troops for inspiration and Captain Poole reveals that their characters mirror themselves:

We’ve all kept our regiments, our backgrounds, and obviously, in my role, I’m the ‘organiser’ who chivvies people to go kayaking down the Amazon,” she said.

Since she wangled a small role, Captain Poole reckons she hasn’t looked back:

It was different, I had no intention of acting, but I’m really enjoying it and now I really wish I had a bigger part.

In the flesh, Captain Poole sounds like a professional actress, a legacy of boarding school elocution lessions to iron out her broad Yorkshire accent. But unlike active service, military personnel recovering from injuries are all on first name terms:

When you go to rehab, everyone uses first names, and also in military sport rank doesn’t exist,” she said.

Otherwise if you’re on the hockey pitch and six Captains are playing, you can’t shout ‘Ma’am’, otherwise six people stop and say ‘who, me?’

But there is another more poignant reason:

Because of what we’re doing, we need to be in a relaxed environment because we don’t need the pressure and expectation linked with our rank,” explained Captain Poole.

When you’re in your own world of depression and pain, you’re a patient, and your responsibility is to recover in the best way that you can.

Back in November, Captain Poole and her fellow actors stood on stage at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, overawed at the challenge ahead:

But we stood on stage this morning and it was like, wow, we are different people,” said Captain Poole. “We are more confident and we are talking about things that we’ve never even shared with our families. People have come out of themselves and it’s been really cathartic.

I am really looking forward to it. It is great to feel enthusiastic about something again - it has been far too long.

With only matinee tickets left, the actors hope that the play will eventually tour the country and there has been no shortage of press interest in the troops’ resolve to overcome tragedy, pain and disability. It is also apparent that lifelong friendships have formed.

Clearly the troops have inspired the director, writer, producer and a handful of professional actors who generously gave unstinting support and encouragement, and will also perform in the play. But it is far from a one-way street and it’s obvious that the professional actors and troops bring out the best in each other:

They might say, just turn this way on stage, little things that you wouldn’t even think,” said Captain Poole.

I think they brought them in because they didn’t know if we could act and we didn’t know if we could pull it off,” she laughed.

But they’re a great bunch, they’ve really helped us along the way and are really good friends.

If it went on tour, we’d jump at it. Through acting, people have found a different person within themselves.",Support to ARRC personnel and their families,Welfare,,id25_654

Many are veterans of recent operations in the Middle East, and, further back, the Adriatic, Northern Ireland and the Falklands.

Prince Michael was met by Commander Justin Wood RNR, Head of the Air Branch, who briefed him on the changes in the Air Branch since his last visit in 2004 and on the plans for the Air Branch to develop within the overall expansion of the RNR.

Commander Wood commented:

We were delighted that Prince Michael should visit us again to see the Reserve effect over all areas of the Fleet Air Arm and in particular in Commando Helicopter operations.

The Air Branch is proud of its ethos of ‘Experience in Reserve’ and was able to show how that experience is a highly cost-effective multiplier of the Fleet Air Arm’s capability.

Calling in on the Commando Helicopter Force, Prince Michael was introduced to the part-time reservists who are embedded with the regulars on a daily basis, enabling the Fleet Air Arm to achieve its outputs, including flying training and all aviation supporting roles.

He also flew a sortie in a Sea King Mk4 helicopter from 848 Naval Air Squadron - the Prince is a qualified military pilot and had a chance to act as a ‘P2’ - crewed by two reservists: Lieutenant Commander Ric Fox and Chief Petty Officer Aircrewman Andy Vanes, both of whom are current part-time flying instructors on the squadron.

As well as operating at Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) Yeovilton, where 220 reservists are based, the Air Branch also has another 100 people, mostly at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall.",Release of the ‘Reach For The Skies’ album,Informational,,id25_655
656,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/getting-around-the-allied-rapid-reaction-corps,News story,Getting around: the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps,2010 saw the ARRC move hundreds of its people from Germany to the UK. This year they are deploying to Afghanistan. Report by Leigh Hamilton.,Ministry of Defence,4 February 2011,"Headquarters ARRC faced one of its most challenging prospects last year; to move - in just two months - 900 personnel and 400 families (2,000 people) from their base in Rheindahlen, Germany, where they had been for 18 years, to the former RAF barracks at Innsworth in Gloucester.

HQ ARRC is the British-led multinational headquarters whose task is command and control of NATO land forces on operations. As one of NATO’s seven High Readiness Force (Land) Headquarters they are able to spring into action and deploy at very short notice.

The ARRC, which was formed in 1991 at the end of the Cold War, consists of 14 partner nations with Britain as the framework nation and providing the life support.

Personnel took part in their final parade in Rheindahlen on 18 June 2010, marking the end of their almost 20-year residency in Germany. They then completed the move, ensuring the accommodation in the UK was ready, organising school places for forces children and making sure that ARRC staff were in work, on 23 August 2010.

Colonel Justin Hodges, Deputy Commander of 1 Signal Brigade and a HQ ARRC Staff Officer, was intimately involved in the move:

It involved a new development of headquarters in terms of building work,” he said. “There is new and renovated officers’ and sergeants’ mess accommodation, new and renovated single living accommodation, a new armoury, new nursery, and a lot of work on the families’ accommodation.

We moved 900 military personnel and 400 families from 15 nationalities including the British. 1 Signal Brigade were tasked to do that and everyone made this as family-friendly as we could.

A lot of the organisation went around ensuring that the amount of upheaval for the families was minimised and well organised so we could actually help people across to the UK in good order. “It was a challenge, but we had a plan and moved people through smoothly, and we were able to spot problems when they occurred and get the right people in place to react.

I think the other aspect here,” added Colonel Hodges, “is that we were very keen to support our partner nations, a lot of whom were coming here for the first time.

There was a reputational piece here for the UK which we were aware of and keen to make sure that when people came here, they settled and were willing to bring their families across. Generally speaking, it was a huge success.

The feedback has been largely positive. Lieutenant Colonel Pierluigi Verdecchia from the Italian Army said:

I came here with my wife Sabrina and our two children. For them, although we were living in Germany, they were accustomed to the UK lifestyle which we were used to within the base.

The move for me and my family went particularly well. We were surprised that everything went so smoothly, it was a fairly straightforward procedure.

Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bateman from the United States has found that life in the UK has its challenges, but that those same challenges are exactly what gives the country its appeal. He said:

Life in the UK is fascinating. I like the fact that I have a ‘local’ which as I understand is a requirement in the UK - you’re issued with your helmet, your rifle and your ‘local’.

It seems that the military aren’t the only ones to be pleased with the move, as the Gloucestershire local community has welcomed them with open arms:

The amount of support that we’ve had from the Gloucester community has been fantastic,” said Colonel Hodges. “We were welcomed to Gloucester with a service at the cathedral and the Lord-Lieutenant made the point that it is great to have the military connection back in the city. We also had a Freshers’ Fair with more than 100 local businesses showing us what’s available in the area.” Commander of the ARRC, Lieutenant General Sir Richard Shirreff, added:

Gloucestershire has opened its arms to us. I cannot stress what a great county Gloucestershire is to be a regular soldier in.

It’s a county with very strong military links, they’re very proud of those links and they’re delighted to see Imjin Barracks occupied by soldiers again.

They’ve gone beyond the call of duty and really gone the extra nine yards to support us and look after us at every level, from the top end of the county, as it were, to local people, local shops and local businesses.

Now that the ARRC personnel and their families have settled into their new home, all eyes are on the future and what is expected of them. Most immediately, the ARRC headquarters staff are deploying to Kabul to augment the International Security Assistance Force Joint Command for 2011, with the first rotation heading out last month and the second replacing them in July.

That commitment will last for 12 months, after which the ARRC will be focused on preparing to be the standby HQ for the Land Component of the NATO Response Force commitment in 2013 with an extensive programme of training.

Brigadier Paddy Allison, Deputy Commander Rear, explained:

In 2011 we’re going to Afghanistan as part of ISAF, then we’re back here at Innsworth and we’re doing high readiness and NATO Response Force preparation; we then move on to become the NATO Response Force for a whole year on standby when we’ll be on ten days’ notice to move for any crisis worldwide.

We’re due to go back to Afghanistan in 2015 and therefore in 2014 we’ll spend the year preparing for it.

To co-ordinate the logistics of operational training and conducting of the missions themselves is no mean feat. Lieutenant Colonel Simon Butt is the Commanding Officer of the ARRC Support Battalion whose job is to ensure that everything runs without a hitch. The Support Battalion boasts more than 28 trades and some 22 different cap badges providing defence and security for the HQ and artisan and medical support. Lieutenant Colonel Butt and his logistics troops are responsible for the provision of the life support and sustainment of HQ ARRC, both in the barracks and perhaps more importantly on exercise and operations.

Explaining his unit’s role in the Afghan deployment he said:

The battalion itself will be supporting the ARRC on its deployment in January and we will support the second tranche going in July and the recovery of the first tranche and then the final recovery of staff in February 2012.

When the ARRC and elements of my battalion come back in March 2012, we’ll be gearing up to support its NATO formation readiness training in 2012.

Also probably at that stage, the Strategic Defence and Security Review will be coming into play in which the support to ARRC was mentioned. We will face these challenges as they come.

Lieutenant General Shirreff concluded:

I’m very optimistic about the future. We’ve got the operational experience to look forward to, which we will pull together in 2011 and 2013, and we will continue the process to develop and fine tune our ability to deliver command and control of multinational NATO operations.

As …",Ministry of Defence,1 September 2010,"The release of the album is one of the many events taking place this year to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Britain.

As well as being dedicated to personnel involved in the Battle of Britain, the ‘Reach For The Skies’ album also pays tribute to those currently serving overseas on operations and who are also being called on to make the supreme sacrifice.

The central focus of the Decca album is a brand new version of Churchill’s history-changing speech ‘The Few’. For the first time this will be enriched by music from the Central Band and his ‘Finest Hour’ speech is also on the album, another great homage to the RAF.

The album features classic tunes such as Spitfire Prelude, 633 Squadron and the Dambusters March as well as a contemporary new ballad ‘It’s A Long Way To Go’ written by band members Chief Technician Rob Jordan and Senior Aircraftman James Lawrence.

Chief Technician Jordan said:

We wanted to bring the album right up to date and appeal to a new audience, but still reflect the sacrifices made during the Battle of Britain. The ballad reflects on the separation that all servicemen and women feel while serving overseas on operations and the love from their partners and families that carries them through those times.

General Manager for Decca records, Mark Wilkinson, added:

With ‘Reach For The Skies’, and with a little help from Winston Churchill himself, we have produced an album of which we’re all immensely proud, and one that we hope will continue to showcase the excellence of musicianship for which the RAF have always been known.

Dedicated to all the men and women who fought in the Battle of Britain, we hope that it can play some part in keeping alive great music, great musical traditions, and the spirit of The Few.

Minister for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans Mark Francois said:

Thanks to the support and hard work of local authorities across Essex, it is a tremendous achievement that they are signing the Essex Armed Forces Community Covenant partnership today, one of the largest community signings we have seen.

This partnership represents a commitment to tangibly improve the lives of Armed Forces personnel and their families. I want to encourage everyone across Essex to continue to support the Armed Forces Covenant in every way they can.

The Covenant will represent a voluntary statement of mutual support between the civilian community and the local Armed Forces Community and symbolise a formal promise taken by all signatories as part of the national Community Covenant Scheme, launched by the Ministry of Defence, to strengthen the bonds between both communities, raise awareness and provide practical support.

The occasion will mark the joint commitment to promote understanding and awareness amongst the public of issues affecting the Armed Forces Community and recognise how the Armed Forces Community can help and support the wider community.

Essex County Council Leader, Councillor Peter Martin, said:

We are extremely grateful and proud of the dedication from our Armed Forces and it is therefore our duty to ensure they receive the services and help they and their families need to integrate into civilian life.

I would encourage everyone in Essex to join us in showing their respect and supporting the Covenant.

Essex County Councillor Derrick Louis, Cabinet Member for Highways and Transportation and Lead Member for Armed Forces Liaison and Engagement, said:

We want to encourage the people of Essex to support the Armed Forces Community living and working in the county. It is our duty to recognise and remember the sacrifices made by members of our Armed Forces, including the dedicated service personnel, their families and veterans.

Essex has a significant Army presence at Colchester and Wimbish, and has built strong collaborative links with 49 (East) Brigade, the Army’s regional administrative brigade; the East Anglia Reserve Forces and Cadets Association, which represents all three Services; and veterans’ groups. Our aim is to continue to build on the long history of support and collaboration between the Armed Forces and the local authorities throughout Essex.

Speaking on behalf of the Armed Forces community in Essex, Colchester Garrison Commander, Colonel Mike Newman, said:

The military already enjoys strong support from the people and institutions of Essex, which we are immensely grateful for, and the signing of the Community Covenant only serves to strengthen and formalise these existing bonds.

But the Community Covenant represents far more than a symbolic statement of mutual support. It gives a framework for joint work to ensure that services such as housing, education and health reflect the needs of military personnel, veterans and their families.

I look forward to a productive relationship to improve understanding between the military and civilian communities in Essex and also to ensure that the Armed Forces play their part in the community in which they live and work.",Training of Afghan National Army (ANA) instructors,Welfare,,id25_658

The district is one of three in Helmand where British troops are deployed, and the last where Task Force Helmand retains the lead for security after the successful transition of Nad ‘Ali and Lashkar Gah to Afghan control.

Operation KAPCHA ZHRANDAGARAY targeted a 16-square-kilometre area that has seen little influence from the Afghan authorities so far.

The clearance operation saw Afghan bomb disposal experts discover and destroy 10 improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and allowed engineers to build five new checkpoints for Afghan police to hold the territory.

The area was heavily fought over as recently as last summer - as featured in the Channel 5 television programme ‘Royal Marines: Mission Afghanistan’.

Lieutenant Colonel Tom Copinger-Symes, the Commanding Officer of 5 RIFLES, said the insurgency had been strong in the area just four months ago, with insurgents regularly firing on troops and a high IED-threat targeting ISAF and Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF).

But, as the number of patrols with the ANA increased, insurgent activity fell away, and more areas have been handed over to Afghan security control, bringing greater freedom of movement.

Lt Col Copinger-Symes said the success of the operation had seen District Governor Habibullah Khan visit the area for the first time and speak to local elders about the support the Afghan Government can provide; a meeting seen as ‘groundbreaking’ by Afghan officials.

He said:

Security, stability, education, commerce and a normal way of life are key to development, and this must be led by the Afghans themselves. It is the right time to clear Kopak of insurgents, led by the Afghan National Security Forces with International Security Assistance Force troops in support, which allows the police to hold areas.

The new checkpoints will allow more freedom of movement for the locals, and, more importantly, it will allow the Afghan Government to connect with the people and identify requirements for development. This will be the first step in creating long-term Afghan security in Kopak, both for now and for long after ISAF have left.

Lieutenant Colonel Nazamudin, the Commanding Officer of the 2nd Kandak of the Afghan National Army, said:

My warriors are working with the ANP and ISAF to create conditions to allow checkpoints to be built around Kopak and for security to return to this area. The police commissioner will be in place and the local Afghans are very happy with our presence.

I have seen the changes over the years. The insurgents are weakened, the ANSF are growing stronger in presence, and the people are more willing to engage and let us know what is going on.

Major Matt Baker, Officer Commanding D Company, 5 RIFLES, said there had been a lot of change in the area since November last year:

Progress since November has seen the insurgency defeated in the Babaji area and we have denied the insurgent an enduring presence here,” he said.

A tri-Service team of UK personnel is based at the centre to assist in the training and mentoring of the Afghan National Army (ANA) instructors who run the course.

Colonel Shah Wali, Commander of the Regional Military Training Centre, hosted the VIPs who attended the ceremony, including General Sherin Shah, Commander of the 3rd Brigade of 215 Maiwand Corps of the ANA.

Over 800 Afghan soldiers (known as warriors) were on parade - the first recruits to complete the regional basic warrior training course - as well as a smart colour party carrying the Afghan flag.

The quality of the Afghan recruits and the dedication of the ANA training team has impressed the British troops, who partner and mentor the Afghan trainers:

They had over 800 recruits arrive for the first course,” said Sergeant Major Marty Huxter, from 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, “and they’ve only had to send one home. That’s pretty good.

Captain Christian Wragg, 2nd Battalion The Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment, another member of the British contingent, agreed:

These are ordinary guys from all over Afghanistan and this eight-week course is quickly turning them into effective soldiers. The Afghan trainers took our outline for the course, modified it, and have really made it their own - and that’s extremely encouraging.

The opening ceremony was almost overshadowed a few days earlier when a fire broke out in the camp’s brand new cookhouse. As Sergeant Major Huxter explained:

A bit of adversity just brought the multinational team at the training centre closer together - the Brits all grabbed fire extinguishers and got stuck in, fire-fighting. As far as the Afghan soldiers were concerned it really showed that we were all in it together, and we really cared about their facility.",Enforcement of UK and EU fisheries law,Legislative,"Other (Strategic plans, consultations)",id25_660

It looks at how war accelerates medical research, how the current conflict in Afghanistan is contributing to the future of medicine and how these developments enhance medical care.

The first programme, subtitled ‘Survival’, highlights British achievements and the documentary makers were given extensive access to both staff and patients in the main hospital at Camp Bastion, the main British base in Helmand province.

At the hospital, Michael Mosley looks at the medical breakthroughs that are coming out of current conflicts and examines new equipment being issued to the troops like the one-handed tourniquet that is saving the wounded in the critical ten minutes after injury.

He also looks at how advances in surgery and changes in blood transfusions being developed at Bastion will save lives both on and off the battlefield.

Michael also travels to America to look at the latest radical ideas that have the potential to raise the bar of what’s survivable even further.

And in accident and emergency departments in the USA, he looks at the latest medical advances that could save thousands of lives both on and off the battlefield. From using the hormone progesterone to treat brain injuries to trying to keep people alive by cooling them to the brink of death.

In the second episode, subtitled ‘Rebuilding Lives’, Michael looks at what medicine and technology is doing to help seriously injured troops rebuild their lives, including British soldier Rob Long who, blinded in an IED blast in Afghanistan, hopes a new piece of technology can restore his sight.

Michael also meets former US Army Sergeant Glen Lehman and learns how he can control his artificial arm with his mind, as well as learning what researchers are doing to try and find a way to grow spare body parts.",Proud2Serve e-network,Institutional,Welfare,id25_661

Midshipman Phillip Fordham spotted the floating raft as he scanned the North Sea using night-vision goggles. The junior officer saw a glint in the distance and the fishery protection ship’s two sea boats were immediately sent out with first aiders aboard.

They found the raft, rescued the Dutchman, gave him blankets and first aid and brought him back to the Portsmouth-based ship, where he was found to be cold and in a state of shock, but otherwise unhurt.

Mersey had been carrying out a routine fishery patrol off Great Yarmouth when she picked up a frantic mayday call from the yacht as night fell on the North Sea:

Information was limited - the only known facts were that the vessel was on fire and that it was possibly in the area,” said Lieutenant Chris Humphreys.

The warship and other vessels immediately began a search of the North Sea. Mersey’s firefighters and first aid team prepared to deal with the blaze and any casualties, but the ship’s company became increasingly concerned for the yacht’s fate when nothing more was heard from her.

What was left of the boat was found around 30 miles (48km) off the coast - and the sight was alarming:

The scale of the blaze was clear - flames rose metres in the air and explosions were visible from a number of miles away,” said Lieutenant Humphreys.

Once on the scene, it was clear that the yacht had been destroyed. Flaming wreckage remained on the surface, but the focus for the ship turned to searching for survivors.

When the sole crewman was found and brought back to HMS Mersey, he told the crew that he’d been sailing from Lowestoft to his native Netherlands when the fire took hold and he was forced to abandon his yacht.

He was subsequently winched up by a Coastguard helicopter and flown to hospital in Great Yarmouth for further assessment by medical staff.

Lieutenant Commander Mark Anderson, Mersey’s Commanding Officer, said:

I’m immensely proud of how my ship’s company responded to this distress call in challenging conditions and pleased that we were able to rescue the casualty and render first aid.

The yachtsman was in a perilous situation - and understandably in a state of shock - but should make a full recovery.

Sponsored by Google and hosted by the BBC’s Jane Hill, attendees at the awards ceremony included Minister for Equalities Lynne Featherstone MP, Ben Bradshaw MP, and Michael Cashman MEP.

On the day of the awards over 350 people came together to recognise and celebrate the efforts of individuals, organisations and employers who have helped make vast improvements to the lives of the diverse communities of people across Europe. From grass roots campaigners to large corporations, the awards highlighted the exceptional achievements made in this area.

Over 250 nominations were received for the awards and the judging panel was greatly impressed by the very high standard of work being put forward. In this competitive field the tri-Service Proud2Serve e-network was given the Outstanding Employee Network Group of the Year Award.

In 2005, five years after the European Court of Human Rights ruling which resulted in the ban on lesbian, gay and bisexual people in the military being lifted, the website was established on a voluntary, unfunded basis. For the site’s initial members, it was an informal communication route outside the military.

The confidentiality that this afforded was, and remains, critically important to many serving personnel. The website has matured in membership and usage, provides vital, relevant support to users, and is now endorsed and funded by all three Services. Users can contact other serving personnel, seek advice and be guided to the Service LGBT Forums or the Service Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Teams. The network now reaches out to 1,500 registered users in over 22 countries.

Also shortlisted in the European Diversity Champion of the Year category was Lieutenant Commander Mandy McBain. Although not a winner, she was thrilled that her contribution to equality, diversity and inclusion in the Naval Service had been recognised by her nomination and subsequent shortlisting.

The event was attended by ten Navy, Army and RAF personnel from both the LGBT Forums and the related policy areas.

The decommissioning service was conducted by Royal Navy chaplain Reverend Keith Robus, with music provided by the Band of HM Royal Marines Portsmouth.

Among the guests were the ship’s sponsor, Lady Gosling, who launched HMS York in 1982, former commanding officers, families of the 240 ship’s company and civic dignitaries from the ship’s namesake city.

The ceremony ended with the ship’s White Ensign being lowered for the last time. HMS York’s Commanding Officer, Commander Rex Cox, said:

As the final Commanding Officer of HMS York I have the honour and privilege to ensure that we say goodbye to our great ship in style and in the finest traditions of the Service.

HMS York has given 27 years of distinguished service to the Royal Navy across the globe.

Throughout her life it has been the people, the members of her ship’s company, who have made HMS York what she is.

It is time to say farewell to a distinguished lady who has been both a home and a way of life to so many.

We shall miss her. However, rather than being sad, we should look to her numerous achievements and celebrate her 27 years.

The last of the Navy’s Type 42s, York was built by Swan Hunter at Wallsend and launched on 20 June 1982.

She was commissioned into the Royal Navy fleet in 1985 and her first deployment was to the Far East in 1986-87.

She was sent on operations to the Gulf four times in the 1990s and saw front line action in 2003 when she provided air cover to aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal during the invasion of Iraq.

In 2006, HMS York joined sister ship HMS Gloucester in evacuating British nationals from Beirut during the Israel-Lebanon conflict, ferrying evacuees to Cyprus.

And in 2011, during her last operational deployment, she was sent to Malta to assist in the evacuation of British personnel during the Libyan uprising.

HMS York left Portsmouth for the final time at the beginning of the month and headed for Brest in France where she showed off the capabilities of the Royal Navy to French military students.

From there she spent several days in Hull, allowing her ship’s company to exercise their Freedom of the City of York for the final time and say farewell to civic dignitaries and affiliated organisations in the city.

665,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-issues-first-quarterly-report-on-afghanistan,News story,Foreign Secretary issues first quarterly report on Afghanistan,Foreign Secretary William Hague has delivered the Government's first quarterly report on Afghanistan in which he said steady progress is being made although serious risks and challenges remain.,Ministry of Defence and The Rt Hon William Hague,27 October 2010,"Delivering the first of the quarterly reports to Parliament that the Prime Minister announced on 14 June 2010, Mr Hague confirmed that progress in Afghanistan is the top foreign policy priority for the Government, linked closely to our foreign and development policy towards Pakistan.

Mr Hague began his statement, which is prepared jointly by the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development, by praising the work of British forces in Afghanistan:

They are the finest any nation could hope to have,” he said.

We should also remember the families of the 341 men and women who have given their lives and the many who have been wounded. For nine years thousands of Britons have served in Afghanistan in both civilian and military roles in extraordinarily difficult circumstances, and we owe them a great deal.

Mr Hague stressed that the security of Afghanistan remains vital to our own national security and that Afghanistan must be able to maintain its own security and prevent Al-Qaeda from returning.

He said:

NATO’s strategy is to protect the civilian population, support more effective government at every level and build up the Afghan National Security Forces as rapidly as is possible. It also requires the Afghan Government to meet the commitments on governance and security that it made at the Kabul Conference in July this year.

On security, we assess that steady progress is being made across Afghanistan and specifically in Helmand and Kandahar provinces. International forces now number 130,000 while the Afghan National Security Forces will reach 260,000 by the end of the year, exceeding their target size for 2010.

Afghan and ISAF forces have checked the momentum of the insurgency and the area under the control of the Government of Afghanistan is increasing. However, the situation remains extremely challenging.

One of the effects of increased military activity is that the number of security incidents, particularly those involving direct fire, has increased sharply. So we should not underestimate the highly difficult task our forces continue to face.

Mr Hague said that ISAF’s military effort is currently focused on Kandahar, and Afghan and international forces continue to clear the insurgency out of areas adjacent to the provincial capital.

He stressed that the Afghan National Security Forces are taking an increased role in planning and executing the current phase of these operations and make up well over half the forces involved.

Mr Hague said that in Helmand province UK forces continue to train the Afghan National Security Forces and conduct operations against the insurgency.

The Foreign Secretary said that the number of UK troops directly involved in the training and developing of the Afghan National Security Forces is increasing by over 320. This increase, he added, is part of the rebalancing of UK forces in the province, made possible by the handover of security responsibility for Kajaki, Musa Qal’ah and Sangin to our US allies in order to concentrate British forces in the key population centres of central Helmand.

On recent operational activity, Mr Hague said:

On 17 October units of the 3rd Brigade of the Afghan National Army’s 215 Corps launched a significant operation to secure settlements near Gereshk.

This operation is building on the success of previous Afghan National Security Forces operations which have cleared the insurgency out of former safe havens in central Helmand over the course of the summer.

Planning and implementation is being led by the Afghans with British mentors from 1st Battalion Irish Guards providing support.

For the first time, engineering, artillery, countering improvised explosive devices and reconnaissance are being conducted by the Afghan National Army itself.

US Marines, which now form the majority of the ISAF troops in Helmand, continue the hard fought struggle against the insurgency in Sangin, while in Marjah they have continued to carry out operations alongside the Afghan National Army and Police.

Mr Hague said the Government is confident that we have the right military strategy in place and the right number of troops in Afghanistan.

However he added:

We must expect levels of violence to remain high, and even increase, as Afghan and ISAF forces tackle the insurgency.

The murders by insurgents of the Governor of Kunduz province and a District Governor in Nangarhar province reminds us of the violence that still exists, even in the more secure areas of the country.

Mr Hague confirmed that the Prime Minister will attend the NATO Summit in Lisbon on 19 November, when we expect NATO to agree the process of transferring lead responsibility for security across Afghanistan to the Afghan National Security Forces by the end of 2014.

He said it will be a phased transition with the Afghan National Security Forces gradually taking the lead, as they have in Kabul, in jointly selected districts and provinces, as the conditions on the ground are met. British forces will be drawn down from combat operations by 2015.

On governance, Mr Hague said that the Government of Afghanistan is making some progress on its Kabul Conference commitments and on 7 October 2010 the High Peace Council was inaugurated, fulfilling a key request of the Afghan Consultative Peace Jirga in June which, he said, marks an important milestone for the Afghan Peace and Reintegration Programme:

It is for the Afghan people to shape a political settlement which reflects the needs, culture and aspirations of all the Afghan people,” Mr Hague said.

The United Kingdom will support a settlement which gives Afghanistan stability and security, is representative, gives no one group disproportionate influence, upholds human rights and the rule of law, and is in accordance with Afghanistan’s constitutional framework.

Mr Hague concluded by saying that the deployment of British Armed Forces abroad is ‘one of the gravest of responsibilities of Government, along with that of protecting the security of British citizens and territory’:

In Afghanistan the two go hand-in-hand. The Government understands how important it is to retain public confidence in our mission and to ensure democratic scrutiny of it.

We will continue to provide regular and frank assessments to the House. But above all we will do our utmost to ensure that NATO’s strategy in Afghanistan is seen through with rigour and determination and that the extraordinary efforts of so many thousands of our Armed Forces serve to enhance the national security of the United Kingdom.

ABBarnsley-Parson has been a member of Portsmouth-based reserve unit HMS King Alfred since 2007, working evenings in a local pub. A keen athlete, she regularly trains at lunchtime in the gym at HMS Collingwood. Her routine originally consisted of normal fitness training and circuits; weightlifting was not something she had considered as part of her training.

But, one afternoon, when the 2011 Royal Navy powerlifting single-lift championships were being held at HMS Collingwood,ABBarnsley-Parson decided to stay and watch the proceedings, getting roped in by pure chance.

To her surprise, the reservist then found herself as a last-minute entrant in the competition:

I was a complete beginner to the concept of powerlifting.

As an Under-23,ABBarnsley-Parson also qualified for the junior competition.

The competition required competitors to make three lifts - squat, bench-press and dead-lift. She did so well that despite being a novice at the sport she set new records for opening weights in all three categories, achieving a total lift score of 220kg, itself a new junior and open record; an amazing achievement considering her age, weight category and experience.

In the end she won best female lifter (overall) and best bench-press in her weight category of 70kg. The records she set were so good that they now stand for both the junior and open categories.

ABBarnsley-Parson is now training with the Royal Navy Powerlifting Association and is aiming to compete in the inter-Services and regional competitions. She is also hoping to qualify for the British nationals and, if she can, there is still a chance that she could compete in the Olympics.

She is already talking to the British Powerlifting Association about training with the national squad.

When asked what the competition meant to her,ABBarnsley-Parson said:

It’s great that I’ve been given the opportunity, through being in the Reserves, to compete in an event that I would previously have never considered, and it actually turns out I’m not bad! I am very proud of my achievement.

HMS Trenchant’s Commanding Officer, Commander Irvine Lindsay, addressed his smartly turned-out ship’s company on the parade ground. He acknowledged they were very keen to get to sea after the refit and praised them as the ‘finest’ in the Royal Navy. He thanked his crew’s families for their support, which enables the submariners to concentrate on being as operationally effective as possible when away at sea.

The submarine entered the Devonport submarine refit complex late in 2009 and after many months of hard work by Royal Navy technicians and Babcock Marine Ltd it has taken shape as one of the most capable and powerful vessels in the Royal Navy. The submarine has also undergone a number of significant improvements to her sonar suite and Tomahawk cruise missile capability.

Commander Lindsay said:

This is a very special day for HMS Trenchant and her ship’s company. It is a testament to the commitment of the crew and their families and of the support and service of the local workforce that HMS Trenchant returns to the Royal Naval fleet a more capable and deadly vessel than ever.

She is packed with the latest equipment and weaponry and will be a potent presence worldwide for many years to come, and whilst the hardware is impressive, it is the ship’s company who are the key component in HMS Trenchant. It is an absolute honour to be in command of such a fine body of men.

Lady Meriel Hunt was guest of honour at the rededication ceremony on the parade ground at Devonport Naval Base. Lady Hunt became the submarine’s sponsor in 1989 when she launched HMS Trenchant. Her husband, Admiral Sir Nicholas Hunt, was the Commander-in-Chief Fleet at the time.

Lady Hunt inspected ceremonial divisions, with members of the submarine’s affiliated Sea Cadet units, TS St David’s and TS Echo (Llanelli), parading alongside members of the crew.

Families of the submariners were joined by representatives of various organisations from their affiliated town, Llanelli, including members of the town and rural council and old comrades from the Royal Naval Association.

A rededication ceremony is a traditional part of any Royal Naval unit’s life as she completes a period of refit and improvement.

In temperatures plunging below zero degrees Celsius, soldiers were faced with some of the most demanding and realistic scenarios available outside of theatre. One such scenario was the extraction of casualties while trying to avoid enemy improvised explosive devices.

The exercise had a whole host of supporting elements to make it even more realistic, with the soldiers able to call upon the support that they will get once they deploy, including the aid of an Apache helicopter overhead offering covering fire.

1st Battalion The Royal Welsh, based in Dale Barracks, Chester, will also undergo a final battle group training exercise on Salisbury Plain in the coming weeks in advance of their deployment. The battalion’s last tour of Afghanistan was at the end of 2009 and into 2010.

Lieutenant Colonel Steve Webb, Commanding Officer of 1st Battalion The Royal Welsh, said his troops were trained to cope with varying climates and the direct contrast of the searing heat in Afghanistan would also present a challenge:

The soldiers are equipped with the skills they need to prepare them for the forthcoming tour and I’m very pleased with the way training has gone so far. We’ve already undergone individual training and our time in Pembrokeshire will, and has, further focused teamwork in platoons,” he said.

Afghanistan is still a dangerous place to be and when we deploy we need to recognise that.

However, looking at the progress achieved in the country since their last deployment, he added:

The Afghan National Security Forces are more capable than they were two years ago when the battalion last went to Afghanistan. The Afghan Government is also more capable than two years ago.

As we sense it all coming together it gives me confidence we are doing things right.

Lieutenant Colonel Webb said the battalion’s training progression meant that his soldiers would be in peak condition when the time came to deploy.

On return from operations in Afghanistan in 2010, the battalion joined 12 Mechanised Brigade and completed Exercise Askari Thunder in Kenya in April/May 2011.

Lieutenant Andrew Young said:

The standard of soldiers’ skills and drills and physical fitness is quite impressive at the moment. So their fitness will peak when they go out to Afghanistan.

Wing Commander Jonathon Moreton, Officer Commanding 14 Squadron, said:

Today is an incredibly sad day. We say goodbye to a squadron that has a long and distinguished history. Although the squadron number will be no more, the memories, deeds and ethos that made up 14 Squadron will live on in its people. I am immensely proud to have commanded such a successful and esteemed squadron.

14 Squadron was originally formed at Shoreham on 3 February 1915 before it departed for the Middle East on Army co-operation duties in Egypt, Palestine and Arabia. Recalled to the UK in 1919, the Squadron was disbanded that February before being reformed in Palestine a year later, where it remained throughout the inter-war years, flying Bristol Fighters.

By the start of the Second World War, 14 Squadron was flying Wellesley bombers, and in June 1940, with the expected advance of Axis forces through Africa, the Squadron began bombing targets in Eritrea. During mid-1944, the Squadron moved to Chivenor and flew Vickers Wellingtons in the anti-submarine role. This continued until June 1945, when the Squadron moved to Banff in Scotland and traded its Wellingtons for de Havilland Mosquitos.

Following an administrative disbandment, lasting all of one day, 14 Squadron reformed at Wahn in Germany, again with Mosquitos, and continued with these until replacement with de Havilland’s new Vampire bombers arrived in 1951, supplemented two years later by Venoms.In 1955, 14 Squadron again became a fighter unit. With another short disbandment in 1962, the Squadron re-formed at Wildenrath with English Electric Canberras in the strike role until June 1970, when McDonnell Douglas Phantoms arrived. At Bruggen, Panavia Tornado GR1s replaced Sepecat Jaguars in 1985, and, in January 2001, the Squadron moved to Lossiemouth.

14 Squadron’s last operational deployment was in October 2010, in Afghanistan, and lasted three months. During the deployment, the 13 crews and 120 engineers of 14 Squadron supported more than 450 missions, spending over 1,700 hours airborne, ensuring the Tornado GR4 fleet continued to deliver, however required.

Marking the end of this long and proud history, 120 personnel, making up two flights of 14 Squadron personnel, paraded the Squadron standard before His Royal Highness The Duke of York, Honorary Air Commodore of RAF Lossiemouth.

A flypast of four Tornado GR4 aircraft, piloted by crews from 15 (Reserve) Squadron, also marked the event.

Commenting on the disbandment, RAF Lossiemouth’s Station Commander, Group Captain Andy Hine, said:

Today is one of mixed feelings for RAF Lossiemouth; sad because it is never pleasant to say farewell to any squadron, but proud of the 95 years of exceptional service that 14 Squadron has given our nations, including the award of many battle honours for distinguished action in battle.

With the Squadron having recently returned from a highly successful operational deployment in Afghanistan, saving the lives of troops on the ground, we can say with full confidence that 14 Squadron is bowing out with their heads held high.

A total of 15,000 tins left in January bound for servicemen and women across the world, so that they would arrive in good time for the Diamond Jubilee celebrations.

The United Services Tin was presented to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on 1 March 2012 during a visit to Fortnum and Mason in London.

Fortnum and Mason has worked closely with the MOD to create the United Services Tin which is in white and is decorated in Fortnum’s signature ‘eau de nil’ and the insignia of each Service. It contains Fortnum’s Queen Anne Blend tea and clotted cream digestive biscuits.

The inside of the lid is inscribed with the legend:

Since 1707, Fortnum and Mason has been honoured to serve loyal subjects of the Crown. This offering, to serving military personnel on active service, is a token of our esteem for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and Her Armed Forces on the occasion of the Sovereign’s Diamond Jubilee.

A card, giving highlights of the Piccadilly store’s historic links with the British Armed Forces, is also enclosed.

The tea chosen for the servicemen and women to enjoy is Queen Anne Blend, which reflects the history of Fortnum and Mason. Queen Anne was on the throne when Mr Fortnum and Mr Mason went into business in 1707. In addition, each tin contains six biscuits individually stamped with ‘F&M’.

A quantity of tins are being offered for sale at Fortnum and Mason in Piccadilly, with a £1 donation from each sale going to Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association (SSAFA) Forces Help, a charity that supports serving members of the Armed Forces, veterans, and the families of both.

The Jubilee tins were packed by disabled employees at the home of the Enham Trust charity, which was founded in 1918 under the patronage of King George V and Queen Mary to rehabilitate servicemen wounded in the First World War. The charity, which is based in the village of Enham Alamein in Hampshire, now helps around 4,500 disabled adults with their care, housing, training and work needs, enabling them to lead independent lives.

Fortnum and Mason supplied food delicacies to soldiers during the Crimean War, as part of The Times newspaper’s fundraising drive to give treats to the Other (non-officer) Ranks. The origin of sending tinned gifts to troops began with Queen Victoria, who sent chocolate at Christmas to the men fighting in South Africa. In 1914, her great-granddaughter, Princess Mary, headed a fund to send tins of chocolate and tobacco to men fighting on the Western Front. Ever since, the tradition of supplying a small taste of home to those fighting in far off lands has been part of the British way of life.",Deployment of 857 Naval Air Squadron to Libya,Institutional,Other,id25_671

Responding, Dr Fox said:

I am furious that such a situation should occur. This is no way to treat our Armed Forces personnel. I want to know how this was allowed to happen and what measures will be put in place to prevent this from happening again.

An Army spokesman said commanding officers had apologised to those concerned and will also ensure they get advice and support.

Armed Forces Minister Nick Harvey has also apologised and said that all appropriate steps would be taken to ensure that this does not happen again.

Mr Harvey said a ‘serious administrative error’ had been made by the Army Personnel Centre:

People should have been seen individually and then an e-mail would follow with the details,” he said.

Unfortunately in this case, it’s happened the other way around. That’s very regrettable and we will make sure it does not happen again.

For members of the Armed Forces who are made redundant, appropriate support will be provided for transition to civilian life. All Service personnel are able to consult a Resettlement Advice Officer at any time in their career for advice on transition.

Those who have served over four years will benefit from tri-Service resettlement provision through the Career Transition Partnership, which provides briefings, advice and guidance on issues such as housing and obtaining future employment, including access to a job-finding facility. They also have an interview with a career consultant for advice on obtaining future employment, and consultant support is available for up to two years post-discharge.

In addition to the above provision, those who have served over six years are also entitled to a three-day Career Transition Workshop, an Individual Resettlement Training Costs (IRTC) grant of £534 (non-taxable) and up to 30 days’ Graduated Resettlement Time (determined by length of service) on full pay to attend training courses or carry out individual resettlement preparation.

Using two Mark 7 Sea King Airborne Surveillance and Control helicopters, crews flew almost 100 operational sorties over Libya - all at night and usually lasting around three hours. In one month alone, the helicopters were airborne for nearly 150 hours.

The squadron only returned from Afghanistan in December 2010, where it proved its utility in large drugs busts and surveillance missions.

The squadron was only due to go sea for around six weeks in the spring, to prove the UK’s new response force of ships and aircraft could stand ready. But in late May 2011 it was ordered to support operations off Libya and all the people, kit and helicopters were shifted to the 20,000 tonne helicopter carrier HMS Ocean.

The mission was to clear a path for the Apaches - finding safe routes in and out of Libya without being spotted. They also fed back real-time information about ground movements in Libya, passing vital information back to headquarters in Britain and at NATO for analysis.

Lieutenant Commander Geoff Hayward, Commanding Officer 857 NAS, said:

We did what we did at short notice, on war-fighting operations at sea with a squadron just back from Afghanistan. We very quickly got to grips with operating at sea again.

Our main task was ‘wide area surveillance’, protecting Ocean and her escorts, providing awareness of shipping and movements so that Ocean could be in the best position to launch the Apaches and maintain surprise.

The key to Ocean’s success was launching Apaches on their strike missions and to do that our Sea Kings were critical. It wasn’t just because of the situational awareness of land and air, but also because we acted as a communications link between the Apaches and the command on Ocean. That link was crucial to the success of missions.

There’s a great feeling coming back to the ship, seeing the Apaches there, attending the briefing and realising that the information that you passed to them was absolutely vital.

As well as the aircrew flying the demanding missions, 857’s Commanding Officer praised the squadron engineers back on HMS Ocean who worked around the clock ensuring the helicopters were always ready for action. He said:

They deserve a big pat on the back - they’ve worked extremely hard and achieved a fantastic serviceability rate.

Air Engineering Officer Lieutenant Mark Roddy said everyone in the squadron was aware of the importance of the missions - and were kept fully up to date with events. He said:

People were told what we were trying to achieve, and that motivated everyone. The first night of strike operations stands out - seeing the lights on the shore, we could see the tangible results of all the effort that we’d put into that mission. It made a massive difference.

We set out for seven weeks - and managed to stretch it to four months, maintaining a very high operational tempo. I think we’ve proven again how versatile these squadrons are.

The VC10s of 101 Squadron had another excellent week - they not only completed all of their planned missions but their offload of fuel was almost 140 tonnes.

Thorough planning and flexibility ensured that this was delivered to a range of coalition aircraft. The main receivers continue to be from the US Navy, utilising the ‘probe and drogue’ capability of the VC10, with deliveries to a number of variants of the F-18.

The rest of the deliveries saw fuel being delivered to RAF Tornado GR4s and EA-6B Prowlers of the US Navy. This was critical to ensuring that coalition airpower delivered armed overwatch, shows of force and close air support to troops on the ground across Afghanistan.

Attack

The Tornado GR4s of 12 (Bomber) Squadron, operating from 904 Expeditionary Air Wing at Kandahar, continued to deliver their key capabilities in support of a number of coalition ground forces.

The week began with a show of force in support of British ground forces operating in Helmand province who had come under small arms fire in the vicinity of a compound. This was sufficient to deter any further engagement by the insurgents.

Later in the week the GR4s were called on to deliver a show of presence when coalition troops were operating in an area where the potential for engagement with insurgents was considered to be high and an unidentified group began to gather.

And, once again, the squadron undertook a number of successful reconnaissance missions to collect data on points of interest, providing essential intelligence in support of ground commanders.

Intelligence and Situational Awareness

The Sentinel R1 aircraft of 5 (Army Cooperation) Squadron continued to keep a watchful eye on ground activity in Afghanistan and quickly report any new activity to ground commanders. The tactical flexibility of the aircraft and its crew have seen it operate across Regional Command (South West) and Regional Command (East) to great effect.

The majority of the activity was to provide pattern of life data in support of a number of disparate operations led by the US Marine Corps of Task Force Leatherneck and UK ground forces operating as part of Task Force Helmand, accumulating more than 30 flying hours.

The 39 Squadron Reaper detachment, operating from Kandahar Airfield, continued to provide detailed imagery and intelligence crucial to ground commanders, delivering approximately 240 hours of full-motion video (FMV).

The FMV products are used extensively by ground forces operating as part of Task Force Helmand and the US Marine Corps of Task Force Leatherneck. One kinetic strike was carried out against a number of insurgents who were preparing an attack against coalition ground forces.

This successful strike not only terminated their activities but also destroyed a significant number of IEDs which had been prepared for use. In addition, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and rockets were later recovered.",Community Covenant,Other,,id25_674

Some 200 soldiers from the Regiment were on parade, the majority of whom had completed their first tour of Afghanistan and received Operational Service Medals from The Princess Royal.

Her Royal Highness said:

As Combat Support Logistic Regiment, you were in the front line of operations in Afghanistan, across a larger geographic area than any other unit.

A huge part of the Regiment’s success is down to the confidence soldiers had that their families were being well looked after at home, and I would like to thank your Rear Operations Group and welfare team for their tireless work.

The work of all of you in the service of your country is appreciated and will not be forgotten.

Lieutenant Colonel Gerry Ewart-Brookes, Commanding Officer of 13 AA Sp Regt RLC, said:

It was a very successful tour, which took us to every part of the theatre, and we were involved in every aspect of operations.

The success was down to the professionalism of our soldiers and the depth of experience we have in the Regiment, which has deployed to Afghanistan four times.

This parade is about thanking all our soldiers for their efforts and giving them a chance to show off in front of their families, who we must also thank for the marvellous support that was fundamental to our success on tour.

Among soldiers receiving medals was Private Jordan Jack from Dunfermline. The 21-year-old drove an Oshkosh fuel tanker as part of the combat logistic patrols that supply forward operating bases across Helmand. Pte Jack said:

It was a tough tour, but an experience that I enjoyed. We play a key role in giving all the other units what they need to do their jobs. We found ourselves in some difficult situations, but training takes over, the guys around you are awesome and I have made some very deep friendships.

At the council offices in Aylesbury, RAF Halton representatives joined those from several other local military units, and the Chairman of Buckinghamshire County Council, Marion Clayton, to sign up to the Covenant. Councillor Clayton said:

It’s important that we seek ways in which we can improve mutual support and work together to the benefit of the whole community. This Community Covenant is a local statement of that mutual support between the civilian community and its local Armed Forces community.

It’s designed to complement the national Armed Forces Covenant, recognising the unique pressures under which forces personnel work, and the particular needs of their families.

By pledging their support to the Armed Forces units and veterans that call Buckinghamshire home, Buckinghamshire County Council will be able to make a real difference to Service personnel and their families. Some of the initiatives underway across the country include fun days out for Service families and Service children, play parks, mentors for Service leavers and veterans, and support services for those dealing with long periods of separation.

The scheme also works reciprocally, with servicemen and women pledging to aid the community in a variety of ways.

RAF Halton is particularly active within the local community and undertakes charity and community projects as a matter of course. In addition, RAF Halton runs a number of community initiatives, such as the military co-responders scheme, and maintains close links with the local police force.

Both of these initiatives were on display at the Covenant signing event.

The RAF is the largest military presence in Buckinghamshire, with some 2,500 members stationed in the county.

The Station Commander of RAF Halton, Group Captain Chris Elliot, said:

We at RAF Halton hold a unique place within the community of Buckinghamshire, and we work hard to maintain and improve that relationship through all that we do.

The Armed Forces Community Covenant serves to highlight the moral obligation between the community and the Armed Forces so that we can ensure that we support the communities in which we live and work, but importantly ensure that servicemen, servicewomen, families and veterans receive the support that they need from the county councils where they live and work.

To be one of the many military units signing the Covenant in Buckinghamshire is an honour, and I hope that we can all continue to work together for the greater good.

Brigadier Neil Baverstock, Officer Commanding 145 (South) Brigade, who spoke on behalf of the Armed Forces in Buckinghamshire, said:

What we are signing today is only part of a wider relationship that we have with society, and it is that wider relationship that we are seeking to develop alongside the Covenant.

I’ve been incredibly encouraged by the support that I’ve found in the county as we’ve gone about setting up the Community Covenant. Today is a testament to the degree of support that we are feeling in the Armed Forces from the communities in Buckinghamshire. We, as a Defence community, are extremely grateful.

He finished by saying:

The Armed Forces are as much a part of Buckinghamshire as Buckinghamshire is part of the Armed Forces.

He and Secretary Panetta will also discuss the progress of the ongoing NATO operation in Afghanistan, where British and American troops work alongside each other training and mentoring Afghanistan’s own security forces.

On the day that the US Government has announced reductions in defence spending, discussions will take place on the future challenges faced by the North Atlantic alliance as defence budgets across the world continue to be affected by the worldwide economic situation.

This was also a subject Mr Hammond focused on in an address to the Atlantic Council think tank during his visit to Washington.

He urged the alliance to beat the challenges of worldwide economic austerity by finding new ways of working together and identifying greater capability from resources that exist.

Reminding the audience that the Cold War was won because the Soviet economic system failed, the Defence Secretary described the debt crisis as the greatest strategic risk to the future security of both the UK and the US. Military power and economic power are, he said, inseparable.

But Mr Hammond cited the example of the campaign to protect civilians against the threat of the former Libyan regime as an example of NATO’s continuing crucial role in the modern world. He said its flexibility, with an ability to quickly accommodate external partners for specific operations, makes it the most powerful alliance in the world and the most successful tool for collective defence ever invented.

Speaking from Washington, Mr Hammond said:

I look forward to meeting my US counterpart, Secretary Leon Panetta, to discuss our shared interests and how our two countries will face the threats of the future. The US Defence Review today has shown that no-one is immune from the economic situation and that it is not just the UK that has had to take some tough but necessary decisions in defence.

I was also delighted to have the opportunity to address the Atlantic Council on such a vital topic for world security as the future of NATO.

The rocket blasted its way through the aircraft, narrowly missing the pilot and commander but slightly injuring the door gunner.

Chief Petty Officer (CPO) Neil Copeland, who was the Senior Aircraft Maintainer in Afghanistan at the time of the RPG attack, was at Royal Naval Air Station Yeovilton to welcome the aircraft back to 846 Naval Air Squadron.

CPO Copeland led the recovery team that extracted the aircraft back to Camp Bastion and prepared the aircraft for its return to the UK.

Reflecting on the recovery he said:

Because the aircraft was to be airlifted from the checkpoint, the mission was extremely challenging as we had to remove a considerable amount of hazardous equipment and fuel from the aircraft to ensure everyone’s safety and to reduce its overall weight.

We receive military training in theatre for this type of eventuality, but working on the rotor head, which was about 10 feet [3m] above the ground and four feet [1.2m] above the compound wall, certainly concentrated the mind as we were in full view of the terrorists who were responsible for bringing the aircraft down.

However, the Army did an excellent job in providing cover and ensured we were able to get on with the task in hand.

Looking at the aircraft now you would never know it has suffered such catastrophic damage. Vector Aerospace has done an excellent job,” he added.

This is not the first time ZA298 has survived enemy fire. During the Falklands conflict one of the aircraft’s rotor blades was hit by 30mm canon shells from an Argentine Skyhawk aircraft, but within two hours its maintainers had the aircraft flying on another mission.

Two days later the veritable war horse was used to ferry General Menendez, the commander of the occupying Argentine troops, to HMS Fearless where initial surrender negotiations were being held.

With the majority of ISAF forces based in southern Afghanistan, the formation of the new headquarters permits commanders in the south to focus on geographically smaller areas, ensure greater partnering between the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and ISAF, and deliver the levels of security required for governance and development to continue to spread in the region.

Major General Richard Mills of the United States Marine Corps is in charge of the new Command. He leads a combined force of some 27,000 personnel, with units drawn from eight nations:

It is a distinct privilege for all of us to stand up Regional Command (South West),” he said. “We are truly building on the outstanding work of all that have served here in Helmand and Nimruz provinces.

“The establishment of Regional Command (South West) is a natural military progression based on the number of troops serving here and the priority placed on Helmand and Nimruz provinces.

This is the first time that the US Marine Corps has led an ISAF Regional Command. The British officers serving in my coalition headquarters as well as Task Force Helmand have brought invaluable experience and knowledge to the command.

“We are partnered with ANSF at all levels and conducting joint operations throughout Helmand province.

Tough fighting remains,” he added, “but I see evidence daily of progress that will bring about lasting stability across southern Afghanistan.

“This will be a significant year for the future of Afghanistan. Coalition forces, alongside our Afghan counterparts, will continue to support the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan as it delivers legitimate governance, improved security and lasting economic development.”

Lieutenant General David Rodriguez, Commander of ISAF Joint Command, said:

The establishment of Regional Command (South West) significantly increases the ability of the Afghan National Security Forces to partner with the coalition.

Major General Mills praised the work of British forces in Helmand province:

I remain very much impressed by the momentum and achievements of RC(S) under General Carter,” he said. “My predecessors in the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade and the British troops of Task Force Helmand have distinguished themselves in the service of the Afghan people here.

It allows crews to prepare for service on the latest Type 45 destroyers, as well as Type 23 frigates, Type 42 destroyers, assault ships and carriers.

Based across two sites at Fareham and Plymouth, the MCTS features banks of flat-panel LCD screens faithfully replicating equipment used at sea.

The system will be used by around 1,000 new trainees a year and will allow existing personnel to maintain their warfare skills.

Peter Luff, Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology, said:

This new £108m training system represents a groundbreaking move for the Royal Navy that will enhance its training capability for the future.

It will enable personnel to train to the highest standard, utilising the latest technological developments.

With this system, the UK’s sailors will be some of the best prepared in the world, ready to take on the challenges of the future.

The MCTS was procured by the Training, Stores and Boats Team at the MOD’s Defence Equipment and Support organisation and replaces earlier training facilities. The two MCTS sites are nearly 200 miles (322km) apart but are connected by a fibre optic link.

At HMS Collingwood in Fareham, Hampshire, there are three reconfigurable Warfare Team Trainers (WTTs) and eight Electronic Classroom Trainers (ECTs), with a similar facility at Devonport in Plymouth consisting of two WTTs and one ECT.

Chief of Defence Materiel, Bernard Gray, added:

This state-of-the-art system will greatly increase the effectiveness of surface ship warfare training.

It represents the MOD’s commitment to delivering the best equipment for training and simulation required by the modern Royal Navy.

With its ability to replicate all the current destroyers, frigates and capital ships in the fleet, the Maritime Composite Training System provides great flexibility.

Commodore Tim Lowe, from the Maritime Warfare School at HMS Collingwood, said:

A total of 36 hours of video surveillance can now be delivered in support of troops on the ground every day of the year, which marks an 80 per cent increase over the past 12 months.

Reaper has been supporting ground forces in Afghanistan since October 2007 and has now flown over 13,000 hours in direct support of operations. It provides commanders with a constant ‘eye in the sky’ that can seek out and track insurgent activity around patrols, search for potential IEDs, and provide an armed response if required.

One of the Reaper pilots said:

My background is flying support helicopters on the battlefield, but I have never felt more connected to the heart of the battle on the ground than when I’m flying the Reaper.

When you’re speaking to a soldier on the ground for hours at a time, night after night, looking around every corner for him, scanning every tree line and reacting every time his guys take fire, you feel like you really are fighting alongside him.

You can hear the palpable relief in the voices of the guys as we call them up on the radio and check in to provide them with defensive cover and a heavily armed response if called upon.

It’s the most rewarding mission I’ve had the opportunity to complete in the RAF.

The Reaper has a 66-foot (20m) wing span and is powered by a turboprop engine that allows it to stay in the air for more than 16 hours at a time. It carries a multi-spectral targeting system, more commonly referred to as ‘the ball’, which, day and night, collects video from thousands of feet above insurgents, where it is undetectable. The aircraft also carries Hellfire missiles and laser-guided bombs, the release of which remain under the full control of the Reaper pilots on the ground.

Defence Secretary Dr Liam Fox said:

The Complex includes a new state-of-the-art therapy building with a second prosthetics department, radiology department and open plan gym to ensure that injured personnel continue to receive world-class medical care and rehabilitation.

In addition to the Minister for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans Mark Francois, the opening will also be attended by serving personnel and veterans who competed in the London 2012 Paralympic Games.

Minister for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans Mark Francois said:

It is an immense pleasure and privilege to attend the opening of the Jubilee Rehabilitation Complex at Headley Court in my new role as Minister for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans. Countless times we have seen the determination of injured personnel at Headley Court in their rehabilitation, and recently at the Paralympics after their recovery. This fantastic new complex will continue to provide crucial world-class treatment and rehabilitation to those who need it.

Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre Commanding Officer, Group Captain Clare Walton said:

On behalf of all the patients and staff at Headley Court I would like to thank Their Royal Highnesses for officially opening the Jubilee Rehabilitation Complex. I know the new facilities will enable our staff to continue to provide the very best of care to our patients and to keep Headley Court at the forefront of rehabilitation and prosthetics.

I would also like to thank the Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO), its regional industry partner PriDE and principal contractor Rollalong for delivering the complex on schedule.

DMRC is the premier facility for the rehabilitation of injured Service personnel. Originally it was developed as a rehabilitation centre for aircrew and officers following a collection and donation of monies during the Second World War.

In 1984 it opened its doors to personnel of all ranks and Services. It became the main tri-Service rehabilitation centre in 1996 with the consolidation of the then rehabilitation facilities. Since 2002 it has played a central role delivering rehabilitation as part of a Service wide network of 14 medical Regional Rehabilitation Units.

DMRC offers access to all aspects of rehabilitation with on-site Consultants, physiotherapists, exercise rehabilitation instructors, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, social workers, psychologists, prosthetists and Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Programme. There are currently approximately 400 members of staff, split half civilian and half military. It has four gymnasiums a full-size swimming pool, a smaller hydrotherapy pool and a gait analysis laboratory to support the consultant led multidisciplinary team care.

DIO is part of the MOD. It is responsible for managing and maintaining land and properties to meet the current and future needs of the MOD and personnel at home and abroad, and to support current operations. DIO manages the military estate to ensure Defence needs are met, value for money is achieved, heritage protected and environmental goals achieved.

PriDE is a joint venture between Interserve Defence Ltd and Southern Electric Contracting, created specifically to manage DIO’s South East Regional Prime Contract (SE RPC). The SE RPC is one of five UK regional prime contracts.

As part of 16 Air Assault Brigade, 1 R IRISH had just returned from their deployment to Nad ‘Ali (South), and the Colonel was keen to talk about their successes.

When the 1,000 men and women under his command arrived to form the core of Combined Force Nad ‘Ali for HERRICK 13, with a squadron of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment to transport them around in their formidable Mastiff armoured vehicles, they and their coalition partners had one aim:

Whether we were British, American or Afghan, we all wanted one thing,” said Lt Col Weir, “to help develop the people’s confidence by providing them a secure enough space that their government could help them achieve a better life.

Although the efforts of preceding battle groups, such as the Grenadier Guards and 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment, had forced the Taliban out of the northern part of Zarghun Kalay, there was still a thorn in the side of the district - a Taliban sanctuary known as the ‘Red Wedge’. It was a thorn 1 R IRISH were determined to remove.

When we arrived, thanks to ISAF and the Afghan security forces there was a bustling bazaar, a clinic, and a strong police presence,” said Lt Col Weir.

The constant refrain from adults was that they wanted the roads opened so they could take their produce to other bazaars and so that they could reach the district centre. And the refrain from the children was that they wanted schools.

However, some of the outlying areas were not yet secure, and worst of all was the Red Wedge, a triangle driven into the north of 1 R IRISH’s operational area.

Checkpoint Shingul is barely 2.5km from the centre of Zarghun Kalay, and it was under attack every day. The fighting was intense, the enemy were capable; hard core out-of-area fighters who demonstrated that they were adept at command and control and small unit tactics,” said Lt Col Weir.

That no soldiers were killed, Lt Col Weir puts down to the quality of the training and kit:

In particular the new Osprey body armour.

In effect, Shingul was cut off from Zarghun Kalay and the enemy had the local population in its grip. Insurgents were using the wedge as a staging post from which to launch attacks into the district centre and to plant IEDs, especially along the main route, Route Plymouth.

Until we removed that threat, the Government could not move forward in any real way. The ultimate aim was to connect the people physically and psychologically to their Government,” said Lt Col Weir.

The District Governor wanted the Red Wedge cleared, and 1 R IRISH were happy to oblige. It was their first major operation and would take a month.

On two occasions with the Afghan National Army (ANA) taking the lead, 100 British and ANA troops were inserted at night by helicopter into the heartland of the enemy. Although it was the first of their aerial operations, it was by no means their last. The largest took place at the end of their tour in an area to the south of Nad ‘Ali on the boundary of Marjah and involved the insertion of huge numbers of troops using 15 helicopters in a combined air and land manoeuvre operation. Having cleared the area, the enemy were held off while a checkpoint was established.

Our partners in the ANA unit took on this most difficult task, securing the western edge of the Red Wedge, forcing open the route and employing its newly-trained counter-IED experts,” said Lt Col Weir.

The newly-constructed police checkpoint meant that Route Plymouth could be kept open, and access to the district government maintained:

The District Governor and members of his ministry came to meet the people rather than waiting for the people to come to them. They listened to the issues and things began to happen.

Almost immediately shops began to spring up everywhere with agricultural equipment distributed and irrigation ditches cleared.

It also served to introduce the people to their new police force,” said Lt Col Weir. “People had been sceptical at first, believing they would be the same as the old police force, but the output of the Helmand Police Training Centre showed them that the new police force was markedly different.

Keen to give his ANA partners their full due, Lt Col Weir said:

Afghans did all of this work. Afghans secured this area. We assisted them, but by the time we established the checkpoint we were very much in the background. Since the op finished there have been no direct fire engagements in the area Zarghun Kalay (West), and only a handful of IEDs have been laid.

In February, Zarghun Kalay was handed over to Afghans to take the security lead, thus releasing ISAF soldiers to operate in higher risk areas and to concentrate on mentoring the Afghan Army and Police. In a voice, now even huskier, Lt Col Weir said:

The ANA and the ANP [Afghan National Police] are more than capable of looking after themselves now. And, they are more than capable of looking after their people.

In the seemingly ever-present haze of the Gulf region, a Trafalgar Class submarine (T-boat) and an approximate American counterpart, USS Pittsburgh, led a seven-strong naval task group as the exercise drew to a close.

Exercise Arabian Shark 2012 is the latest in a regular series of anti-submarine exercises held in the Middle East region for the past decade.

As well as the T-boat and the US Los Angeles Class nuclear submarine, the Royal Navy committed frigate HMS Westminster to Arabian Shark, the Americans provided destroyer USS Sterett, the Saudis corvettes Hitteen and Badr, and, from Pakistan, a blast from the past for the Royal Navy participants: PNS Badr - perhaps better known as the former Type 21 frigate HMS Alacrity.

For Westminster, roughly halfway through her east of Suez deployment, Arabian Shark was a chance for her to get back to her raison d’etre - fresh from counter-piracy operations and the success of a £14m drugs bust.

The Portsmouth-based ‘capital ship’ and her twelve Type 23 frigate sisters were designed in the late 1980s to hunt Soviet submarines in the North Atlantic.

Since then the world has changed, as has the technology: Westminster has the best submarine-hunting helicopter in the world, an 829 Naval Air Squadron Merlin, and the world’s best submarine-detection equipment in the form of the Sonar 2087 towed array system.

So, during the exercise, the submarines tried to hunt and ‘kill’ the warships, and the surface forces did likewise with the submarines.

The main aims of the exercise were to strengthen military relationships and improve the war-fighting techniques of all the navies involved.

Lieutenant Thom Hobbs, Westminster’s Principal Warfare Officer (Underwater), said:

Arabian Shark was a significant international exercise allowing for the strong bonds between the participating nations to be reinforced.

We are working together to ensure security and stability at sea.

The exercise was hailed a resounding success, with all of the units involved gaining valuable training with a variety of other nations’ units in a strategically important area of the world.

With Arabian Shark concluded, the Royal Navy T-boat and USS Pittsburgh made a rare appearance on the surface of a wonderfully-calm Arabian Sea for the ever-popular task group photograph.

HMS Westminster has now resumed her wider maritime security role in the Indian Ocean. Since leaving Portsmouth in January, she has mostly been employed as part of the 25-nation Combined Maritime Forces counter-piracy task force, disrupting pirate activity and making the region safer for the merchant shipping that passes through it.

Westminster is due back in the Solent in August 2012.",,Other,,id25_685

The most recent exercise saw Blyth use both her ship’s divers and the advanced Seafox mine disposal system to detect drill mines laid in her area of operations. At the same time the task group vessels had to respond to simulated attacks by small boats, fast jets and helicopters.

Commanding Officer of HMS Blyth, Commander Tim Davey, said:

The exercise saw Blyth prove her capability in mine detection and disposal as well as training the ship’s force protection teams against a variety of realistic simulated threats. Working closely with the Turkish Navy, the exercise provided us with a great opportunity to train my team and maintain our core skills.

Helping to assist HMS Blyth in her role as command platform are two NATO staff officers from the Greek and Turkish navies who are embarked on board the ship, working closely with the crew to support the planning and execution of the ship’s tasking.

The exercise is the latest challenge in a demanding deployment for the sophisticated minehunter. Before arriving in Turkish waters she found herself at the centre of a major salvage exercise in the Aegean Sea. Involving a simulated fire and flood on board, the scenario was designed to draw resources and personnel from other task group ships and test their responses:

The assistance at sea exercise was a great opportunity for the four vessels in the task group to work together in a high-pressure situation,

said Lieutenant Commander Charlie Noonan, Blyth’s Executive Officer, who co-ordinates the response in the event of an on board emergency.

In the end, the response from all the teams was excellent and it proved the close bonding and high levels of co-operation that exist among the sailors.

The emergency exercise finished with a German firefighting team re-entering a smoke-filled compartment, a Turkish first aid team dealing with simulated casualties, and an Italian damage control team conducting dummy repairs to ‘flooded’ compartments.

The crew of HMS Blyth are now looking forward to three weeks of maritime security operations in the eastern Mediterranean before saying farewell to their NATO colleagues and embarking on the 3,000-mile (4,800km) journey home to Scotland in early December.

During her time with the task group, Blyth has successfully conducted multiple exercises and training all over the Mediterranean, including important maritime security operations and a minehunting exercise in the Black Sea:

The deployment has been both challenging and highly rewarding,

commented Lieutenant Hamish Maxwell, HMS Blyth’s Navigating Officer.

Since arriving in the region in early July, the crew has done an excellent job and, although we will miss our NATO friends, it is a good feeling to be approaching the end of our tour.

The action-packed day off the south west coast included a thrilling Lynx helicopter display, and the ship turned up the volume by sending off a salvo from its main gun.

In fine weather, families and loved ones packed the frigate’s upper deck to make the most of her departure from the historic dockyard of Devonport.

Once out of Plymouth, the Type 23 frigate began its programme of demonstrations with a firefighting display, firing its 4.5-inch (114mm) gun and operating with Fleet Air Arm helicopters.

As well as impressing onlookers, having the chance to test the main gun is invaluable preparation for any potential use during the deployment.

The day was particularly special for one little girl - Chief Petty Officer Kevin Williams’ daughter Pippa not only celebrated her sixth birthday on board, but was delighted when the main gun sounded an appropriate six times. CPO Williams is the missile director on board who works in the operations room co-ordinating missile strikes.

CPO Williams, from Stockport, was also on board with his children, Hannah, aged ten, and nine-year-old Harry, and his wife Lynn:

Pippa had a very exciting day celebrating her birthday and I told her we fired the gun six times because it was her sixth birthday and it made her very happy,” he said.

The ship’s weapons engineering officer, Lieutenant Commander Paul Evans, from Plymouth, was on board with his two children, Lucy, aged nine, and Connor, aged 13. Lucy was given the rare chance to steer the ship and was told by the captain, Commander Paul Bristowe, that she drove an accurate, straight line better than him.

Connor said that he wanted to join the Navy and become a weapons engineering officer like his father.

Lieutenant Commander Evans said:

This is a great chance for my family and all the other families to see where their sons and daughters, husbands and wives, work and live. This is especially important with a six-month deployment coming up. We need our families’ support and this visit reinforces the strong support we know we can rely on when we are deployed far from home.

Commander Bristowe said:

The day went very well, everybody smiling, and it is good for the families and the ship’s company to have this time together before we deploy.

The ship only came back in December from the last deployment, and it has been a great achievement for a dedicated and committed ship’s company to turn the ship round in order to be operational for our next deployment.

It has been tough for the families to be off again so soon but we know we can rely on their support, and today is part of showing our appreciation to them.

There was plenty of entertainment for all, including children’s face-painting, and sea shanties were sung by the Fisherman’s Friends band.

The 25-year-old, serving with the Tidworth-based 2nd Royal Tank Regiment, was amongst a crew of soldiers patrolling in one of the Army’s new Warthog armoured vehicles.

They were out on a routine security patrol, providing reassurance to local communities, when suddenly they were re-tasked to reinforce infantry colleagues who had been pinned down by fire from hidden insurgents and needed urgent back-up.

Lance Corporal Murfitt, from Barnstaple in Devon and known to Army mates as ‘Murf’, said:

It had been a pretty standard patrol, but when the call came in and we were re-tasked, we were told to get in there fast and provide support.

I was in the rear half of my Troop Sergeant’s vehicle ready to give precision fire with my rifle, and the driver stepped on it to get there as quickly as possible.

Our arrival, with our heavy firepower, seemed to bring the fight to an end fairly quickly, but we stayed alert.

Everything was quiet, but then I spotted three men with a child on a compound roof, about 300 yards to the front of the vehicles.

Suddenly two of the men moved off, leaving one man with the child - it was a girl, no more than 10-years-old. At this point I realised something was wrong - the man picked up a rifle and moved behind the child, taking aim at me.

LCpl Murfitt immediately told his commander that he could identify a possible insurgent who was using a child as a shield and taking aim at his vehicle.

He was faced by a dilemma: he could protect himself and engage the insurgent but, if he did that, he could not guarantee that the child would be unhurt. Making a split-second call, LCpl Murfitt took the decision to wait. He said:

I knew I could take him down but, being a dad myself, I didn’t want to run the risk of killing a kid and undoing all the good work we’ve achieved. So I waited, hoping that the child would drop down and give me a clear shot.

But then, as he was waiting for the moment to strike without putting the girl’s life at risk, the insurgent fired a single shot - it struck LCpl Murfitt on the left hand side of his helmet knocking him to the floor.

His advanced Mark 7 Combat Helmet, a piece of kit which has already saved so many lives in Helmand, took the force of the bullet. LCpl Murfitt was uninjured, but left on his back, on the floor of the vehicle, dazed and seeing stars. He explained:

I felt the dent in my helmet and said to the others, ‘I’ve been shot in the head but I’m fine’. I tried to stand up but I had ‘disco [wobbly] legs’ and just had to sit down again for a bit!

Despite being shaken, LCpl Murfitt kept his cool and managed to signal to the vehicle gunners where the shooter was. The child had run off as soon as the shot was fired, giving the troops the chance to strike without endangering the girl. LCpl Murfitt added:

As I sat back, and started to take in what had happened, I heard automatic fire as the Warthogs engaged the insurgent.

Following the incident, LCpl Murfitt was straight back out on patrol with his colleagues.

Lance Corporal Murfitt and his Tank Regiment comrades - known as Tankies - are specifically tasked with protecting infantry soldiers and engineers working on the development of a major road in central Helmand.

This task is critical to improving trade and general living conditions for the people in the area, but it is difficult and dangerous. There is a constant threat of attacks from insurgents, who view the road as a threat to their control over people’s lives.

LCpl Murfitt has already fought in Afghanistan with the Royal Tank Regiment once before; in 2007, when he was also a pioneer of a new vehicle, becoming one of the first soldiers to use the heavily armoured Mastiff.

He says that, while it’s tough in Helmand, the love and support from his family at home makes things tolerable. When his tour comes to an end next year, LCpl Murfitt looks forward to getting home to his family in Barnstaple.",Presentation of new Colours to the Coldstream Guards,Other,,id25_689

They were originally used as rallying points on the battlefield as long ago as during the time of the Kings of Babylon, and were vital because, without modern communications, it was all too easy for troops to become disorientated by the fog of war.

From the reign of Queen Anne every regiment was awarded two Colours: the Queen’s Colour and the Regimental Colour.

In the Guards Regiments, the Queen’s Colour is crimson silk and the Regimental Colour is the Union Flag. Both carry the most notable of the regiment’s battle honours.

The new Colours for the Coldstream Guards carry 44 of their 117 battle honours, the last being the Gulf in 1991 for the liberation of Kuwait.

Since then the Coldstream Guards have served operationally in Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Iraq, and Afghanistan in 2007/8 and 2009/10, when the battalion was awarded an unprecedented four Military Crosses.

The new Colours were presented to the Coldstream Guards today by the Queen, who is their Colonel-in-Chief. She was accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh.

Colours were last carried into action by the 58th Foot in South Africa in 1881. Up until that time they participated in all the varying fortunes of their regiments, and, often torn by enemy fire, they acquired an almost religious significance. Colours are always carried by an officer and accompanied by an armed escort.

The Coldstream Guards is the oldest regiment in the British Army, having provided unbroken service to the nation since 1650.

In 1660 General George Monck was instrumental in the restoration of the monarchy and the parade today was an extension of that tradition of loyalty to the Crown.

The Coldstream Guards have served with distinction in campaigns throughout the nation’s history, particularly in the Napoleonic, Crimean and Boer Wars, and the First and Second World Wars, winning a total of 13 Victoria Crosses.

Following the presentation of the new Colours the regiment will prepare to ‘Troop the Colour’ on 16 June. On parade they will be joined by elements of the Grenadier, Scots and Irish Guards and by the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment and the King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery.

After Trooping the Colour at Her Majesty’s birthday parade this summer the regiment will prepare to deploy to Afghanistan once more.",Support for local infrastructure projects and handover of checkpoints to Afghan National Security Forces (ANAF),"Other (strategic plans, consultations)","Welfare (indirectly, through stability and economic development)",id25_691

Flight Sergeant Hanson was the duty winchman when the Search and Rescue Sea King helicopter that he was serving on was sent to rescue a kayaker in difficulty on the River Dart.

Upon arriving it became clear that despite the fact that he was wearing a buoyancy jacket the kayaker was trapped beneath the surface of the water.

Flight Sergeant Hanson was winched 120 feet (37m) into the white water rapids which contained rocks and other hazards:

We arrived over a very steep-sided valley; there were lots of tall trees that had shed their leaves so we could see, and there was a thin lane where there were no trees,” he said.

There was a particular group pointing at an area of white water in the river. The winch operator and I did a safety check; we identified that there was a blue triangle underwater that was the insignia on his [the kayaker’s] jacket - he was being held underneath the water.

The tree canopy was a major issue so they could not get me near to the bank to have a look. Near the casualty we could see a small gap in the trees so the winch operator could winch me through that gap.

The emergency services had put a lifeline over the river which I could grab onto to stabilise myself. The plan was to put me into the water; I would then let go of the lifeline and be carried by the water to the casualty whilst still attached to the helicopter.",Exercise Pipedown,Other,Welfare,id25_692

1 LSR won the Nordic team combination event, while the 1st Regiment Army Air Corps took the honours in the Alpine team combination.

Captain Thomas of 3 Close Support Battalion Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers finished as the best individual men’s Alpine skier, winning the individual Alpine combination competition, while in the women’s Alpine events Major Nikki Jordan of the Royal Army Dental Corps was declared best individual female after completing a clean sweep of victories in the women’s Slalom, Giant Slalom, Super Giant Slalom and the Downhill.

Staff Sergeant Walker of 1 LSR won the best individual men’s Nordic title, while Sapper Harris of the Royal Engineers Ladies won the overall women’s Nordic prize.

Top women’s Alpine skier Major Nikki Jordan, aged 34, a five-times-winner of the Combined Services individual ladies skiing title and the Army ladies team captain, said:

It’s great to have done so well. I wanted to do as well as I could in these championships and am looking forward to competing in the Combined Services event.

I started skiing when I was about six and have never looked back; Downhill is one of the biggest challenges. Events like this are a great reward for soldiers who are doing a fantastic job, especially during this time of heavy operational commitments. It is a test of courage and overcoming fear.

Major General James Bashall, General Officer Commanding 1 (UK) Armoured Division, who visited the championships and met with many of the competitors, said organising training opportunities such as Exercise Pipedown is part of the Army fulfilling its military covenant with soldiers:

In these days of intense operational commitments, exercises like this give our people a change, which is important for the process of coming down after an operational tour,” he explained.

It is incredibly valuable and important - a chance for our people to put their hearts and souls into a different activity; a world away from Afghanistan, maintaining their health and well-being.

This is a valid military activity which develops all the traits we expect soldiers to have on operations, such as good marksmanship, fitness, co-ordination, teamwork, leadership and organisation, courage, boldness and co-operation - but Pipedown is also a chance for soldiers to enjoy themselves.

The Army promises a life of adventure and opportunity. This is one of those opportunities.",Joint Warrior exercise,Other,Informational,id25_694

The aim of the project is to use a learning environment to aid the recovery of wounded, injured and sick Service personnel. The project will introduce the Service personnel involved to leading theatrical professionals and will give early Service leavers career opportunities in the theatrical industry.

The project has been put together with the help of the Theatre Royal Haymarket Masterclass Trust and the Royal British Legion, working in partnership with the Army Recovery Capability and Royal Navy Recovery Pathway.

Ray Winstone said:

Amazing. Stunning. A got-to-do idea!

The Legion’s National President, Lieutenant General Sir John Kiszely, said:

The Bravo 22 Company is an extraordinary project bringing together an exceptional group of individuals, whom I have no doubt will reap great benefits from this opportunity as facilitated by the Theatre Royal Haymarket Masterclass Trust.

“The project is an exciting addition to the Legion’s support for the recovery of injured Armed Forces personnel, and our care for their families.”

Arnold M Crook, Trustee of Masterclass and Chairman of the Theatre Royal Haymarket, said:

Masterclass is delighted to be partnering the Royal British Legion and the MOD in our biggest project to date. The two performances of the Bravo 22 Company project, hosted by the Theatre Royal Haymarket in January next year, promise to be thoroughly rewarding for all concerned.

The performances will take place at the Theatre Royal Haymarket on Sunday 22 January 2012. Members of the company will participate directly in the creation, production and performance of the piece, giving them direct insight into the theatrical industry and helping to improve self-awareness, confidence and motivation to support their individual recovery, and in particular help those who are transitioning into civilian life.

Although the anti-armour missile has been used in combat by British forces in Afghanistan and Libya, this is the first time that Apache pilots have fired live missiles in the UK.

As well as training the Apache pilots themselves, the firings also allowed the crew of HMS Illustrious to practise safely delivering the missiles from the ship’s weapon magazines to the helicopters on the flight deck - just as their counterparts on HMS Ocean did off Libya when the fearsome gunships struck at Colonel Gaddafi’s war machine with pinpoint accuracy.

The Hellfire missile firings conducted from HMS Illustrious once again proved - as HMS Ocean did so effectively last year off Libya - that the potent combination of Apache helicopter and Hellfire missile can be successfully delivered by a UK warship at sea,” said HMS Illustrious’s Commanding Officer, Captain Martin Connell.

Major Piers Lewis, Officer Commanding 656 Squadron AAC, added:

The Army Air Corps’ Apache crews are comfortable operating in all environments and this has once again demonstrated our ability to fire Hellfire from sea having launched from HMS Illustrious.

The regiment and squadron forged excellent links with HMS Ocean last year and are now forging similarly strong links with Illustrious.

The Apaches and Illustrious are two pieces in the enormous ‘jigsaw’ that is the latest Joint Warrior exercise taking place at various locations from the top of Scotland to its south western tip, and involving more than 8,000 participants from half-a-dozen nations.

Of the 30-plus warships and auxiliaries, 15 are British, with the Royal Navy and Royal Marines - the latter spearheaded by 3 Commando Brigade and 45 Commando - comprising around just short of half of the total forces involved.

Joint Warrior is due to reach its climax in the next couple of days around West Freugh, just south of Stranraer, but when it concludes Illustrious will remain in the area to support Exercise Scottish Lion, which is also played out in South West Scotland and involves 45 Commando.",Awarding a Commanding Officer’s Commendation to 33 (Engineering) Squadron,Other,,id25_696

This was stage three of NATO’s plan …",Ministry of Defence,3 June 2011,"This year marks the fifth anniversary of when nearly 3,500 British troops deployed to Helmand province. This was stage three of NATO’s plan to bring security to Afghanistan by expanding ISAF’s influence into the south of the country.

The move meant that ISAF subsumed coalition forces that were already operating in Helmand. The deployment was consistent with the UK’s strategic plan for Afghanistan which argued for a single command and control authority which would establish a coherent, multinational approach in the province. And as a leading member of ISAF and NATO, it was important for the UK to show its commitment to the mission.

The objective was to extend government control in areas where the Taliban had held sway. This would be achieved by working jointly with Afghan institutions, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development to create provisional reconstruction teams which would establish development zones, which in time would spread outwards across Helmand, like ink on blotting paper.

Famously, during a visit to Afghanistan in April 2006, the then Defence Secretary, John Reid, said:

We’re in the south to help and protect the Afghan people to reconstruct their economy and democracy. We would be perfectly happy to leave again in three years’ time without firing one shot.

Many misinterpreted this as meaning there was an expectation, or hope, that we would leave without having fired a shot. In fact, the quote had been intended to reinforce the position that the UK troops’ goal was to protect governance and development activities as opposed to taking deliberate kinetic actions.

The fighting faced by 16 Air Assault Brigade in 2006 was ferocious, and, by the end of the year, troop numbers had been doubled. Today there are 130,000 ISAF troops in Afghanistan, of which the UK’s enduring contribution is well over 9,000.

The quality of equipment supplied to the Armed Forces began to attract much criticism, especially as the insurgents turned to improvised explosive devices as their weapon of choice, and in-service vehicles at the time were not capable of meeting the new threat.

The need for more armoured transport was especially recognised, and through the Urgent Operational Requirements (UORs) process nearly £2bn was spent providing protected mobility vehicles such as the Mastiff and Ridgback.

Between 2006-07 the UK Government spent £700m in Afghanistan. Three years later that had risen to more than £3.7bn on top of the Defence Budget. As of February 2011 more than £4.8bn has been approved for equipment through UORs.

As well as a need for extra resources, including fast jets and attack helicopters, it later called for a change in tactics, including a permanent presence to protect Sangin and other key population centres. The decision was taken to deploy UK forces to Sangin, Musa Qal’ah and Now Zad. Combat outposts, known as platoon houses, were established and soon gained a reputation as being significantly important.

Although the platoon houses did frustrate the insurgents’ attempts to threaten the development zone, it came at a high military risk, and may have produced a negative feeling among locals who found themselves closer to the fighting.

In Musa Qal’ah, for example, the Paras were pinned down by insurgents for 52 days. General Richards, the ISAF commander at the time, said:

Clearly the immediate vicinities of the platoon houses became areas where the average civilian with any sense left, and his home was destroyed.

In October 2006, to demonstrate the reach of his authority, Governor Daud reached an agreement with the tribal elders of Musa Qal’ah, establishing an exclusion zone around the town that ISAF troops would not enter; in return the elders would deny the Taliban access. The agreement lasted less than four months.

Over the next year expansion of ISAF and Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) established a security footprint that allowed the re-establishment of a government presence in both Sangin and Musa Qal’ah, but the reach didn’t extend beyond a few kilometres from the district centres.

In 2008, despite showing early promise in terms of comparative stability, Lashkar Gah came under ferocious attack by a Taliban force in excess of 300. Although successfully disrupted, that attack highlighted the vulnerability of central Helmand. Shortly after his election in 2009, US President Obama approved the deployment to southern Afghanistan of an additional 17,000 troops, and a month later he boosted this by a further 4,000, specifically to train the ANSF.

And then came the appointment of General McChrystal who conducted his own review of the situation, describing it as ‘serious and deteriorating’, and as a result argued for a new approach.

His four main pillars were improved partnering with the ANSF, prioritising responsible and accountable governance, gaining the initiative, thereby reversing the insurgents’ momentum, and focusing resources where the population was most threatened.

The new approach called for proper resourcing and depended on an integrated civilian-military counter-insurgency (COIN) campaign, earning the Afghan people’s support by providing a safe environment. The strategy resulted in a further force level increase of 30,000 more US personnel and an extra uplift of around 10,000 other ISAF troops targeted at the southern provinces of Kandahar and Helmand.

This surge meant that a redistribution of manpower in line with COIN principles was possible. As US numbers increased, so they assumed responsibility from the UK for northern and southern Helmand, ultimately taking over in Musa Qal’ah, Kajaki and Sangin.

At the end of this process, UK troops were consolidated in three central districts, Lashkar Gah, Nad ‘Ali and Nahr-e Saraj, which contain about 30 per cent of the total population and the main economic centres. Throughout the campaign, the cost has been high, with 365 British troops having sacrificed their lives at the time of writing. Yet real progress has been made.

Some things that were inconceivable five years ago are now happening in Helmand. The strength and spread of the insurgency has been challenged; often in areas that were previously insurgent strongholds, the Afghan Government is now in control. The ANSF strength and quality has grown significantly. They are beginning to take responsibility for security and have been involved in high profile operations. As a result, economic and social development are beginning to burgeon.

Between now and 2015, NATO and the Afghan Government have agreed that responsibility for security in provinces and districts will transition to total Afghan control. After that, UK forces will no longer be in a combat role, or be present in the same sort of numbers as now. But the relationships forged in the heat of battle in Afghanistan will stay strong, based on trade, diplomacy and development, and helping to build the Afghan forces for the future.

Due to the operational tempo in June 2011, the C-130J fleet experienced a number of technical issues that potentially could have grounded the vital tactical air transport assets, seriously affecting the transport of troops and cargo, and aeromedical evacuations.

The detachment faced an engineering challenge that tested their management and technical expertise in the harsh conditions of the Afghan summer.

Commanding Officer of 904 Expeditionary Air Wing, Group Captain David Bentley, said:

The 33 (Engineering) Squadron detachment has far exceeded the capability expected of it, and has demonstrated the highest possible standards of service and commitment expected for a unit on deployed operations.

The detachment had no prospect of receiving a replacement aircraft from the UK and faced the additional complexity of the C-130J Force’s move from RAF Lyneham to RAF Brize Norton, plus the unrelenting pressure of the continuous operational tempo.

The engineering team wasted no time in implementing a gruelling work regime to prevent mission failure.

The engineers worked tirelessly in the Afghan dust and heat to complete the aircraft repairs; temperatures on the flight line soared to a blistering 51 degrees Celsius but at no point did the C-130J fleet fail to complete a planned mission, ensuring critical support was provided to the coalition campaign.

Despite the challenges faced, the team also provided assistance to coalition partners with less experience on the C-130J.

Group Captain Bentley officially recognised 33 (Engineering) Squadron’s efforts by awarding the team a Commanding Officer’s Commendation at a small ceremony on the C-130J flight line at Kandahar Airfield. He added:

During a dinner to mark the end of the course on Tuesday 7 February 2012, Captain Wales and his fellow students were congratulated by the Apache Force Commander, Colonel Neale Moss, who said they were now up to the challenge of operating one of the most sophisticated attack helicopters in the world.

The prize of best co-pilot gunner marks out the student whose overall performance during the course is assessed as the best amongst their peer group. The award handed to Captain Wales consists of a polished 30mm round from an Apache cannon mounted on a stand. This is the second time the award has been given.

More than 20 students finished the course alongside Captain Wales.

Colonel Moss, Commander of the Attack Helicopter Force at Wattisham Station, said:

The Apache course is extremely challenging, teaching and testing students in their flying skills, decision-making and mental agility on exercise all over the country and abroad. They are assessed continually to ensure that they are up to the challenge of operating one of the most sophisticated attack helicopters in the world.

This requires composure, dedication and hard work and I congratulate all of the students as they go forward to join an operational squadron and continue to learn more in their aviation careers.

The Apache training is conducted in two parts: the Conversion to Type course at Middle Wallop in Hampshire, which teaches students to fly the aircraft, and the CTR course at Wattisham which teaches them how to fight the aircraft.

A major part of the CTR course is a two-month exercise in the United States known as Crimson Eagle.

This exercise includes environmental training where students have to prove their proficiency in handling the aircraft in mountainous and desert conditions, including dust landings and limited power training during both the day and night, as well as safely employing the aircraft’s weapons.

It also includes a period of judgemental training in the use of the weapon systems in a challenging tactical situation. Towards the end of the exercise all students took part in a live firing phase where they were able to fire all of the aircraft’s weapon systems within realistic tactical scenarios.

Students who have completed their Apache training are awarded ‘limited combat ready’ status, having proven themselves in a range of demanding assessments, both on their own and operating as pairs of aircraft.

The course is designed to prepare students for the Apache aviation challenges faced in the current operating climate.

They will now be assigned to squadrons in the Apache Force based at Wattisham, part of 16 Air Assault Brigade.

Captain Wales will be assigned to 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where he will gain wider experience flying Apaches and taking part in exercises in the United Kingdom.",Show of force and flypasts,Other,,id25_699

Meeting a manifesto pledge to crack down on anti-social behaviour, the new Respect Orders will give the police and local councils powers to ban persistent offenders from town centres or from drinking in public spots such as high streets and local parks, where they have caused misery to local people. These will be piloted prior to national rollout to make sure they are as effective as possible.

Perpetrators can also be required to address the root cause of their behaviour by being mandated to undertake positive rehabilitation, such as attending drug or alcohol treatment services, or an anger management course to address the underlying causes of their behaviour.

Failure to comply with Respect Orders will be a criminal offence. Police will have the ability to immediately arrest anybody who is breaching their Respect Order.

Police will also be given stronger powers to seize vehicles involved in anti-social behaviour will also be strengthened, with officers no longer required to issue a warning before seizing the vehicles which bring misery to local communities.

This will allow police to deal more swiftly with the scourge of off-road bikes in public parks and dangerous e-scooters on pavements, street racing and cruising. It will also assist the police in tackling car meets, which can see hundreds of cars gather in public spaces that often include loud aggressive engine revving and intimidating music.

Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper said:

Too many town centres and neighbourhoods across our country are being plagued by anti-social behaviour, be it street drinking, harassment or vandalism on the high street or noisy and intimidating off-road bikes terrorising our estates.

Antisocial behaviour chips away at communities’ sense of confidence and pride, undermines local businesses and can have a devastating impact on victims.

This cannot be allowed to continue. Respect Orders will give police and councils the powers they need to crack down on repeated anti-social behaviour, keeping our communities safe and ensuring repeat offenders face the consequences of their actions. We will also make it easier to seize the vehicles causing misery in too many neighbourhoods, including deafening off-road bikes or e-scooters ridden dangerously on the pavement.

These new powers alongside thousands more neighbourhood officers and PCSOs will help this government deliver on our mission to take back our streets.

As well as prison sentences of up to two years, criminal courts will also be able to issue unlimited fines and community orders, such as unpaid work, and curfews as punishment for breaching a Respect Order. This will ensure that the most serious offenders are dealt with before their behaviour can escalate and cause further harm.

The new powers will be introduced as part of the forthcoming Crime and Policing Bill, partially replacing existing Civil Injunction powers for adults, to ensure a wider range of penalties as breaches will be dealt with in the criminal courts, alongside the new power of arrest. Existing legislation will be amended to allow the police to seize nuisance off-road bikes - and other vehicles which are used in an anti-social manner - without having to first give a warning to the offender.

Enhanced powers will complement the government’s commitment to restoring neighbourhood policing in England and Wales. The Neighbourhood Policing Guarantee will bring back police patrols to town centres, recruit thousands of additional officers to neighbourhood roles and ensure every community has a named local officer to turn to.

Deputy Chief Constable Andy Prophet, National Police Chiefs’ Council Lead for Anti-Social Behaviour, said:

I welcome the introduction of Respect Orders and stronger powers to seize vehicles being driven in an anti-social manner.

Respect Orders will give the police and councils the ability crack down on those who persistently make our streets and public spaces feel unsafe. I am pleased to see the ability to ban offenders from our high street and parks, with a power of arrest for those who ignore such direction, as well as the power to require individuals to seek help for underlying causes of their poor behaviour such as drug or alcohol misuse.

Similarly, giving officers the option to immediately seize vehicles from those who use their vehicle in an anti-social manner is welcome addition to the powers available to officers to crack down on ASB and make our street safer.

Harvinder Saimbhi, ASB Help CEO said:

As the national charity that supports victims of ASB, we regularly hear from victims who share with us the impact and harm they experience from repeated incidents of ASB.

We welcome the approach of addressing the root causes of the anti-social behaviour which will in turn work towards reducing reoffending rates, therefore bringing respite to victims and communities.

Built by the city council to reduce congestion and air pollution in the city centre, it’s hoped that the road will dramatically improve access to the base for staff and visitors alike.

Naval Base Commander, Commodore Rob Thompson, said:

The new link road is proving a big hit with the many thousands of employees at the base and our many visitors too. It is providing greatly improved access in and out of the base and is cutting congestion in the city centre.

Other guests at the ceremony were the Lord Mayor of Portsmouth, Councillor Cheryl Buggy, and Portsmouth City Council Chief Executive, David Williams.

After the ceremony, the Princess Royal met council staff and contractors who were involved in the project.

Princess Royal Way is a direct route into the base or Portsmouth international port off the M275. Instead of southbound vehicles having to enter the city centre and then double-back, they can make a direct right-turn to their destination.

A wall alongside the road has been decorated with a mural by local artists from Art and Soul Traders, showing ten naval ships through history, starting with the Mary Rose and ending with one of the new aircraft carriers now being built.

As the UK’s leading armed forces charity, the RBL revealed today that it hopes to raise £40m as it celebrates its 90th anniversary this year.

The 2011 campaign has been launched under the slogan ‘shoulder to shoulder with all who serve’ and is backed by an online campaign and a chart-destined official single recorded by the Bee Gee’s Robin Gibb and forces pop sensations The Soldiers.

Attending the launch was Lance Corporal Tyler Christopher, of 4th Battalion The Rifles, who was injured by an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan in 2009.

As a result of the blast he had to have both legs amputated above the knee. The RBL was there to provide immediate and essential adaptations to his home:

Changes to my mum’s home were essential when I came home from Headley Court, and I’ll never forget that the [Royal British] Legion got the job done as quickly as possible to make life at that time easier for me,” he said.

Both myself and my girlfriend are grateful for the support of the Legion and hope to some day set up our own business - something we know the Legion is also able to help with.

TV presenter Gethin Jones also attended the launch. He said:

I’m honoured to be launching the Poppy Appeal. I’ve experienced first-hand what life is like for our brave servicemen and women on operations and how much the British public’s support means to them.

They risk so much for us every single day. I ask everyone to throw their support behind the appeal and to wear their poppy with pride.

This year’s Poppy Appeal involves a new social media campaign which encourages members of the public to log on to shouldertoshoulder.org.uk and pin a poppy to an online photograph, add a message of support, and place it alongside thousands of others on an interactive wall.

The RBL Director of Fundraising, Russell Thompson OBE, said:

Of course, everyone who wears the paper poppy is also standing shoulder-to-shoulder. It doesn’t really matter whether you wear your poppy on the street or online - just so long as you wear your poppy with pride.

At the launch, which took place earlier today, Thursday 27 October 2011, The Soldiers performed the official Poppy Appeal song for 2011, I’ve Gotta Get a Message to You.

…moving tribute to our serving personnel who lay their lives on the line for our country every day.

Although the song was not written all those years back about soldiers, it can represent the human emotions of servicemen - or in this case, a single soldier,” he added.

It’s about being trapped in a corner, far from home, brave but scared and thinking of loved ones. These men and women deserve our respect and support.

Local authorities will be working quickly to set up Test and Trace Support Payment schemes and we expect them to be in place by 12 October. Those who are told to self-isolate from today will receive backdated payments, if they are eligible, once the scheme is set up in their local authority.

Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said:

Anyone can catch coronavirus and anyone can spread it. We all have a crucial part to play in keeping the number of new infections down and protecting our loved ones.

As cases rise it is imperative we take action, and we are introducing a legal duty to self-isolate when told to do so, with fines for breaches and a new £500 support payment for those on lower incomes who can’t work from home while they are self-isolating.

These simple steps can make a huge difference to reduce the spread of the virus, but we will not hesitate to put in place further measures if cases continue to rise.

As the infection is now spreading rapidly again, these new measures will help ensure compliance and reduce the spread of COVID-19.

A number of steps will also be taken to make sure that people are complying with the rules. These include:

Recognising that self-isolation is one of the most powerful tools for controlling the transmission of COVID-19, this new Test and Trace Support payment of £500 will ensure that those on low incomes are able to self-isolate without worry about their finances.

Just under 4 million people who are in receipt of benefits in England will be eligible for this payment, which will be available to those who have been notified that they must self-isolate from today

Home Secretary Priti Patel said:

These new measures are about saving lives. Everyone must take personal responsibility and self-isolate if they test positive or if told to do so by NHS Test and Trace.

For those who fail to do so, the police will enforce the law. These new fines are a clear sign that we will not allow those who break the rules to reverse the hard-won progress made by the law-abiding majority.

Local Government Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:

Councils across the country are working at pace to set up new self-isolation support payment schemes and ensure people in their communities have the information and advice they need to stay safe and reduce the spread of the virus.

Since the start of the pandemic councils have played a crucial role in supporting businesses and their communities, and I want to thank them for their hard work as they roll out this new support for those who need to self-isolate.

Fines will also be introduced from today for those breaching self-isolation rules, starting at £1,000, in line with the existing penalty for breaking quarantine after international travel. This could increase to up to £10,000 for repeat offences and the most serious breaches, including for those preventing others from self-isolating.

Employers who force or allow staff to come to work when they should be self-isolating will also be liable for fines of up to £10,000, sending a clear message that this will not be tolerated.

If someone or another member of their household has symptoms of coronavirus, they should, as now, isolate immediately. If someone receives a positive test result, they are now required by law to self-isolate for the period ending 10 days after displaying symptoms or after the date of the test, if they did not have symptoms. Other members of their household must self-isolate for the period ending 14 days after symptom onset, or after the date of the initial person’s positive test.

If someone is instructed to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace, because they have had close contact with someone outside their household who has tested positive, they are legally required to self-isolate for the period notified by NHS Test and Trace. Both household and non-household contacts must self-isolate for the full period, regardless of whether they have symptoms and, if they develop symptoms and take a test, regardless of whether any test taken gives a negative result.

Individuals will receive this payment on top of any Statutory Sick Pay or benefits they receive. Currently individuals in employment who are self-isolating and cannot work from home are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) if they earn more than £120 a week from a single employer. Depending on their circumstances, they might also be able to claim Universal Credit and/or new style Employment and Support Allowance.

The criteria for self-isolation payment is:

This will initially be England-only, but we are engaging with devolved administrations to explore opportunities for a UK-wide scheme seeking as much alignment as possible.

Councils will also have discretion to make payments to those who don’t receive the qualifying benefits, but are on a low income and could suffer financial hardship as a result of not being able to work.

As per the current guidance, the legal obligation to self-isolate will afford specific exemptions including for those who need to escape from illness or harm during their isolation, and those that require care.

Local Authorities will focus on the principle of encouraging, educating and supporting self-compliance. Where there is clear evidence that someone is not following the rules, the police will determine what follow-up action to take.

Users of the official NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app are anonymous and we cannot force them to self-isolate or identify them if they are not self-isolating. The app will advise a user to self-isolate if they have come into close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus. Users should follow that advice to protect their loved ones and stop the spread of the virus.","Engagement with Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, developing and strengthening the UK’s relationships.",Other,,id25_705

The 30-year-old marine engineer, who works on the ship’s sophisticated propulsion system, said:

When I joined HMS Diamond - my namesake ship - it raised a few eyebrows. But now to receive a Diamond Jubilee Medal in addition to that, I feel really proud - this is a special time for the whole nation.

CPO Diamond, from Portrush in Northern Ireland, joined the Navy 13 years ago and has been with the ship since it was handed to the Navy from its builder BAE Systems in 2010.

He will be among the 190 crew for the ship’s maiden operational deployment to the Gulf next month.

Entertainment on the jetty-side included a Royal Marines Band, a band and guard of Sea Cadets from Weston-super-Mare, and, as a special treat for the young families, Father Christmas set up his stall beneath a Christmas tree to hand out early presents to children.

HMS Somerset’s primary role on deployment was to protect the Iraqi oil platforms which are vital to the Iraqi economy and the reconstruction effort of the coalition campaign.

HMS Somerset’s maritime security operations continued throughout the Gulf and she contributed to counter-piracy operations off the Horn of Africa.

HMS Somerset’s Commanding Officer, Commander Andrew Burns, said:

My ship’s company of 200 has achieved considerable effect throughout the Middle and Near East in direct support to the UK’s strategic interests in the region and as part of coalition maritime forces.

Our presence has supported the Iraqi Navy to defend the Al Basrah oil terminal, allowed legitimate seafarers … to go about their business unhindered.

We have engaged with key allies of the UK throughout the Gulf. This activity confirms the UK’s and the Royal Navy’s commitment to the security of this vital region.

My ship’s company are now looking forward to a well-earned leave period before we return in the New Year and prepare to regenerate to deploy again in 2011.

The Type 23 frigate sailed from Plymouth in May to the Gulf of Suez where it joined Combined Task Force 150, a coalition maritime task force to counter terrorism, smuggling and illegal arms trafficking in the Middle East, across an area of over 2.4 million nautical square miles.

The Royal Navy continues to help protect the shipping lanes where 33,000 shipping movements take place and which carry half of the world’s oil and gas each year. For 122 days HMS Somerset successfully improved the stability of the Gulf region.

The ship then joined Combined Task Force 151, a coalition maritime force dealing with counter-piracy operations. The task force has resulted in a reduction of piracy attacks by 15 per cent within the Gulf of Aden in two years.

In the Gulf, HMS Somerset defended the Al Basrah oil terminal and helped in the transition of security duties to the Iraqi Navy, which is increasingly taking responsibility for their territorial waters and the oil platforms.

The ship deployed her Royal Marines and ship’s crew as potential boarding teams 250 times in their smaller boats to check on shipping and engage with the masters and crew of dhows and merchant vessels. The response of the maritime community to the presence of the Royal Navy was highly positive.

Sergeant Barry Quinn, who hails from Burnley, was driving the Mastiff armoured transport vehicle carrying a group of soldiers when a roadside bomb, laid by insurgents trying to disrupt the work of the International Security Assistance Force, exploded.

The heavily armoured Mastiff withstood the blast, protecting all its passengers, and was then able to continue on its journey without any further delay.

Sgt Quinn’s role as a Mastiff Group Commander means he has a team of ten men and two to three Mastiffs to command in Helmand province. He said:

I was going to pick up some people when my vehicle was hit. Initially I thought it was the rear of the vehicle as there was a cloud of dust. I went back to check on the guys and found another IED, which we marked to be dealt with later. Everyone was OK and the vehicle was still able to move, it just had a couple of popped tyres.

Sgt Quinn, who joined the Army as a 16-year-old, wasn’t surprised about the Mastiff’s ability to shield its passengers from danger:

The Mastiff is a great bit of kit,” he said. “They are reliable and have saved a lot of lives. At the beginning of our tour one of the lads in a Mastiff was hit by a big IED and all he had were a few bumps and scrapes.

Sgt Quinn joined the Army after attending the Army Foundation College in Harrogate which was built specifically to train and educate 16-year-olds before they join the Regular Army:

It was brilliant - it sets you up for the future,” he said of the experience. “I promoted from private to corporal in four years, and then reached the rank of sergeant in another four. The usual time to reach the rank of sergeant is 12 years within an infantry battalion.

In 2004 he went back to the Army Foundation College as an instructor:

Teaching there was the best two years of my career,” he said.

Sgt Quinn is now looking forward to the end of his tour and seeing his children, twins Ryan and Owen, aged two, and daughter Courtney, aged four, and taking them on holiday.",Requirement to generate a Lead Commando Group (LCG) drawn from 3 Commando Brigade to be kept at very high readiness to respond to crises around the globe.,Institutional,Administrative,id25_708

Hundreds of people turned out in the towns of Whitby and Guisborough to wish the soldiers well and cheer them on their way, with the streets lined with people applauding and children waving flags.

In Guisborough, 80 soldiers from ‘C’ Company, commanded by Major Rich Grieve and led by the Battalion’s Pipes and Drums, came to a halt in the town’s market place. The troops were inspected by the Mayor of Guisborough, Councillor Mike Kilby, and there was a short ceremony before the parade dismissed at Prior Pursglove College.

Major Grieve thanked the public for their support and praised their enthusiasm:

“The parade went fantastically well, and it did so because of the reaction of the crowds - it really made the day. There was impromptu applause which grew and was much appreciated by the troops. They were really pleased with the reaction we had.”

On parade in his hometown, Guisborough soldier Sergeant Stuart Gibson said:

We had a really good reception, and a lot more people turned out than I expected. I even spotted my younger brothers and sister at the side of the road waving to me. Unfortunately I didn’t get to speak to them today, but I will before I go to Cyprus.

Between October 2009 and April 2010, the Battalion served in Afghanistan, working closely with the Afghan National Security Forces throughout Helmand province, in areas such as Sangin, as part of the Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team.

The Battalion also exercised its Freedom of the Borough of Scarborough this week - which includes Whitby, marching through the town’s streets for the first time. Like Guisborough, Whitby is one of the Battalion’s heartland towns, with close ties to the soldiers and their families.

Transferred from Royal Navy warships such as HMS Bulwark - the fleet flagship, the Marines are injected onto the land via boat or helicopter from where they can go directly into combat with land forces.

Although the main training objective is to prove that the two countries can work side-by-side, and can also integrate their equipment and communications, Exercise Corsican Lion comes under Cougar 12 - a three-month deployment involving four Royal Navy warships, one Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship and naval and RAF air power.

Cougar 12 has more than 3,000 Royal Marines, sailors and airmen taking part - with the sole objective of testing the capability of the Response Force Task Group, a rapid reaction force that can be deployed to deal with unexpected world events such as the Libyan conflict.

The Marines, lead by Brigadier Martin Smith, make up the Lead Commando Group (LCG), whose skills are currently being put to the test.

Brigadier Smith said:

It is an incredibly versatile force and our burgeoning interoperability with the French further proves this. The quality of Royal Marines Commandos and French Marines delivers a highly effective first response capability which is optimised for early entry operations.

Working together gives the UK and France the flexibility to take part in a range of operations in support of government objectives. Amphibious forces can conduct regional engagement, maritime security and evacuation operations, and deliver humanitarian aid or carry out disaster relief, all whilst remaining ready to fight if need be.

In early May, as part of a military exercise, unarmed equipment was put in place at the six proposed sites for a period of nine days. This saw the air security plan tested extensively and confirmed the utility and integration of the various elements.

As a result, based on military advice, the Government has now agreed to the deployment of ground based air defence systems – including Rapier and High Velocity Missile systems - at the six locations for the duration of the Games.

The systems will be in place by mid-July, along with other Defence equipment including Royal Navy helicopter carrier HMS Ocean, which will be moored in the River Thames, Royal Air Force Typhoon jets, which will be temporarily stationed at RAF Northolt, and Puma helicopters, at a Territorial Army centre in Ilford.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond MP said:

Whilst there is no reported threat to the London Olympics, the public expects that we put in place a range of measures aimed at ensuring the safety and security of this once-in-a-generation event. Ground-based air defence systems will form just one part of a comprehensive, multi-layered air security plan which, I believe, will provide both reassurance and a powerful deterrent.

We have undertaken a wide programme of engagement with the communities affected, involving relevant local authorities, landowners, MPs, Council Leaders, and community meetings. These have shown that, while people understandably have questions and concerns which we have sought to answer, broadly speaking communities are supportive of our work.

A small number of activists object to the deployment of these defensive measures and a legal challenge to the Government’s decision to deploy GBAD has been initiated. The MOD will defend these proceedings vigorously and is confident of defeating them.

Home Secretary Theresa May MP said:

Our focus is to deliver an Olympic and Paralympic Games that London, the UK and the world can enjoy. The Games should be a peaceful celebration of sporting achievement and cultural celebration.

But this is the biggest sporting event in the world, and with that comes the huge responsibility to deliver it safely and securely. We are working to a robust safety and security strategy and we will leave nothing to chance.

The police and emergency services have substantial experience of major events and will bring this to bear with support from the military. Our approach is intelligence-led and risk-based, and flexible to respond to changes between now and the Games.

Collectively, the systems include a range of air defence capabilities, including radar and detection equipment as well as weapons, which will provide a powerful deterrent and protection against the threat of an attack from the air. Similar systems have been deployed at all recent Olympic Games.

Some 100 sites were considered as part of early planning but this was narrowed down to the six final sites which were deemed to offer the best possible protection to the Olympic Park and surrounding area against any air threat. The sites, and the specific systems to be deployed at them, are:

Working alongside the police over the last 6 months, the MOD has been conducting an extensive community engagement programme at the six ground based air defence sites. This has included: extensive talks with relevant local authorities and landowners; letters to MPs, Chief Executives and Landowners; briefings to MPs and Council Leaders; attendance at community meetings, open events and leaflet drops for residents, and advertised the hotline and email address for people to contact regarding the deployment of Armed Forces personnel and equipment in London.

We plan to continue this process of engagement with local councils and communities throughout the deployment of GBAD.

The full text of the Written Ministerial Statement laid in Parliament by the Secretary of State for Defence is copied below.

For more information about this press release, contact the Ministry of Defence press office on 0207 218 7954.

The Secretary of State for Defence (Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP)

In December 2011, I informed the House about the military contribution that was being planned in support of the police-led safety and security operation being put in place for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. I can now confirm that, following further planning and exercising, the Government has agreed to the deployment of Ground Based Air Defence (GBAD) systems as part of this contribution.

The deployment will consist of four Rapier and two High Velocity Missile (HVM) systems which will form part of an integrated and multi-layered air security plan that includes Typhoon aircraft (at RAF Northolt) and helicopters (at Ilford TA Centre and from HMS OCEAN) as well as a network of Air Observers and radars. This plan provides the most effective capabilities to deliver a safe and secure airspace during the Games.

Both the Rapier and HVM systems were deployed to six carefully selected sites for the live military exercise, Ex OLYMPIC GUARDIAN, which took place between 2-10 May. The exercise allowed us to test the integration of the equipment with the other elements of the air security plan and confirmed the effectiveness of the GBAD systems, including the associated detection capabilities that are themselves important in compiling the best situational awareness of the airspace over London.

The Government recognised at the outset that the deployment of military equipment and personnel across London could be unsettling. The deployment of military assets, including GBAD, is a temporary measure to provide security over the period of the Games. Since December, the MOD, with the Metropolitan Police, has been engaging local communities, landowners, relevant Council Leaders and Members of Parliament to allay concerns, provide reassurance about these deployments and, as far as possible, take measures to minimise the local impact. The MOD remains committed to this engagement and is pleased that the majority of the public recognise and support our important contribution to keeping the Games, London and the UK as secure as we can. A small number of activists object to the deployment of these defensive measures and a legal challenge to the Government’s decision to deploy GBAD has been initiated. The MOD will defend these proceedings vigorously and is confident of defeating them.

The coming weeks will also see the return of HMS OCEAN to the Thames, Typhoon aircraft to RAF Northolt and helicopters to Ilford TA Centre. The mobilisation of volunteer reservists in support of the Olympics will also begin in earnest. The Defence contribution to the wider Police-led safety and security operation is on a similar scale to that of other recent Olympic Games. It is a balanced and proportionate measure which will deter would-be aggressors and reassure domestic and international audiences that we are ready to play our role in ensuring a safe, secure and enjoyable 2012 Olympics.

712,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mod-police-officer-discusses-her-role-in-helmand,News story,MOD police officer discusses her role in Helmand,A MOD police officer recently returned from a six-month mission to train Afghan National Police (ANP) recruits says she is optimistic about the future of the country.,Ministry of Defence,9 February 2011,"Temporary Inspector Jane Underwood was the head of civilian policing at the Helmand Police Training Centre (HPTC) and led a ten-strong team of MOD police officers in mentoring new recruits. She said:

When you are training you have to put over a very positive attitude and trust the Afghans themselves to be capable of running their own security forces.

They understand what’s right and what’s wrong and good and bad, and it’s about breaking the cycle from the past. It’s about being brave and standing up to the problems they see.

That’s where our training can help; we interact with theANPat all levels and seek to break old patterns of behaviour.

They are beginning to understand that what they are trying to achieve is to build up trust with the local populations. They know they have bridges they need to rebuild.

T/Insp Underwood was well-placed to train recruits, having spent much of the previous five years training MOD police officers at the Force HQ at Wethersfield in Essex.

She started work at theHPTCin May 2010 after it had been operating for six months:

Gradually through education things will change,” she said. “Certainly the majority of the people I met were enthusiastic, even those who have been in theANPfor some time but who were having their first training.

You could see the changes in them. One of my top recruits was someone who had lost a leg after being injured fighting the insurgency. He’d been in theANPa long time but was receiving his first training, yet his dedication and attitude were fantastic.

Initially, T/Insp Underwood worked alongside Army trainers from the Queen’s Royal Lancers regiment before then being joined on her mission by soldiers from 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland:

Establishing the Rule of Law in Afghanistan is obviously key to the country’s future stability, and with my training and policing skills I knew that I had something to offer,” she said.

Temporary Inspector Jane Underwood in a Husky armoured vehicle [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2010]

“The training centre was up and running when I arrived but we knew we needed to push it on. It’s such an evolving beast, it’s constantly changing, adapting and improving, and it has to in order to deal with the challenges it faces.

Classes have big numbers,” she added. “Here in the UK we had a maximum of 18, but there they were 35 to a class. Another issue is that nearly all of the students are illiterate, so that in itself raises problems - conventional teaching practices go out the window.

You could do very little lecturing because the students wouldn’t be able to absorb it. Instead everything was procedure-driven with lots of role play and hands-on stuff. It was about looking at ways they could absorb the information and really enjoy it.

We had a core of Afghan instructors working with us that could reinforce and consolidate that and eventually these instructors will be doing all the training themselves.

The students also had 64 hours of literacy instruction over the eight-week course, and that’s another key element for success. It’s a driver for recruitment, it empowers them.

One of my defining moments was to see anANPtrainee, an existing officer who had never had any training in the past, come up to me with his workbook to show he had written his own name in his own language for the first time.

To see how proud he was, it stopped me in my tracks, because that’s a huge key to success.

The environment that theANPofficers have to work in means that the training is by necessity a mix of civilian policing and more military tactics and procedures as well.

T/Insp Underwood said:

They go on patrol as police officers but anything could happen. So, if they are fired upon, they have to be able to respond to that, use their skills and then deal with the aftermath.

My team concentrated on the civilian policing aims for the first weeks of training, whilst the Army concentrated on the areas of their expertise, then it starts to all join up and everything we do after that we do together.

Among the skills taught to recruits are baton-handling, handcuffs use, arrest procedures, proportional use of force, custody procedures and the Afghan constitution and law. They also learn weapon-handling, marksmanship and mine and bomb detection.

T/Insp Underwood said:

It’s an eight-week course but the development after that is constant. TheHPTCis a starting point; it’s not the end. There are teams of British soldiers and Royal Military Police who go out around the patrol bases and checkpoints and continue the training.

But it all comes back to being a police officer and working with the local community and there are now areas in Helmand where they can do that job.",Tactical Engagement Simulator Exercise,Administrative,,id25_712

The parade of more than 400 Royal Marines marked the ceremonial public recognition of the name change of the UK Landing Force Command Support Group (UKLF CSG), which existed from 2001 to 2010, to the current new 30 Commando, which has existed in the past as a unit devised by James Bond author Ian Fleming under the motto ‘Attain by Surprise’.

Under its original guise, UKLF CSG, the unit has been deployed on operations in Iraq (2003) and Afghanistan (2006, 2008/2009); however, the name UKLF CSG was no longer deemed appropriate to reflect its role.

Major General Howes praised the covert battlefield intelligence-gathering unit and said the name was also a significant honour in memory of those in the unit who have died in combat, adding:

It is with great pleasure to be here today at the remustering of 30 Commando which reawakens the unit’s fighting name as a band of brothers.

The Commanding Officer of 30 Commando IX Group, Lieutenant Colonel Matt Stovin-Bradford, said the special day was a proud one for him and was key in generating cohesion by giving it a similar style name to other commando units:

The men under my command in 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group Royal Marines, colloquially known as 30 Commando, are in no doubt that they make valuable contributions in support of amphibious and land operations.

However, a change of name hardens an already galvanised group of specialists whose principal function on operations is to develop our force’s understanding of the environment and adversaries through analysis and reconnaissance, which in turn is used to inform decision-makers at every level.

The role we perform can be traced back to the Second World War, a lineage of which we are immensely proud and is now reflected in our new title.

He said that, although visual intelligence is still carried out today as it was in the past, current technology (such as satellite monitoring) enabled the unit’s surveillance to happen at distance, while still providing commanders with the precise information on enemy positions and activity required to prepare a suitable reaction with confidence.

Since the Second World War, 30 Commando has undergone a number of name changes. The name has historical significance - 30 Commando IX Group can trace its history back to 1942 and MI6 Officer Ian Fleming.

Fleming’s concept, based on similar units used by the Germans, was for a unit comprising information-gathering teams, operating in front or with the main body of troops.

Their role was to collect information from enemy headquarters and installations using covert infiltration into enemy territory by land, sea or air.

30 Commando Assault Unit (as it was named) was formed, and during the Second World War operated in North Africa, the Greek Islands, Norway, Pantelleria in Sicily, Corsica and North West Europe.

30 Commando Assault Unit was also involved in the D-Day landings, tasked with capturing intelligence on enemy weapons, submarines and mines, and captured an enemy radar station.

Technology has changed since the Second World War, but the role of 30 Commando IX Group is essentially the same.

30 Commando IX Group today now employs electronic warfare, intelligence, manned and unmanned aerial surveillance, information and psychological operations and communications to provide the commander of 3 Commando Brigade with the information that he needs in order to make decisions in any operation.

The Portsmouth-based warship has just completed two months in the hands of the team from Flag Officer Sea Training (FOST), specialists who prepare the entire fleet for all eventualities when deployed around the globe.

Daring left Operational Sea Training (OST) off Plymouth with a ‘very satisfactory’ score from the assessors - most ships generally pass the exacting workout with a ‘satisfactory’ mark:

Everyone’s really pleased that the ship did so well at OST - we are ready for anything now,” said Leading Seaman John Davies.

It will be great to get home though, see my wife, and relax for the first time in two long months.

Those ‘two long months’ saw Daring carry out hurricane disaster relief at Bull Point, opposite Devonport Naval Base; evacuate civilians from a worsening international crisis; deal with terrorist attacks while alongside at the base; demonstrate that she can cope with an attack involving biological or chemical weapons; fight off swarms of small attack craft at sea; and, not least, her raison d’etre, fending off air attack.

Daring came through her first stint with FOST in the spring of 2010, during which numerous lessons were learned about training the 45s for front line deployments - and since when Daring herself has received additional firepower (Phalanx automated Gatling guns) and witnessed a substantial change in personnel (including a new commanding officer).

Although half the class of six Type 45s have been declared operational, none have deployed yet as they have been undergoing either training, maintenance or enhancements.

2012 will be the ‘Year of the 45’ with Daring, Dauntless and Diamond all earmarked to make their maiden deployments.

The first to go, fittingly, will be Daring - although when and where to will not be disclosed until nearer her departure date.

Over the next few weeks bespoke kit for her impending deployment will be fitted and tested, and there will be some final maintenance and husbandry before the destroyer sails:

I now have absolute confidence in my ship and her crew,” said Commanding Officer Captain Guy Robinson.

I have seen them face the challenges that may be expected of a warship which could be asked to operate anywhere across the globe.

Recent events in the Mediterranean and Middle East demonstrate just how quickly a crisis can develop. Daring’s versatility, reach and punch make her a very credible UK asset - and one that I am proud to command.",Organisation of the Royal Wedding Ceremonial Elements,Administrative,Other,id25_715

It was also an opportunity for him to personally thank some of his staff for their efforts in a busy and operationally-demanding environment and to send them season’s greetings.

With a large flight deck, an internal dock and spacious accommodation,RFALyme Bay, which also serves as a floating headquarters for the Commander UK Mine Countermeasures Force and his small battle staff, is ideally placed to deliver a range of command and support functions.

Commodore Walworth met members of the ship’s crew, together with the embarked Royal Navy force protection team and mine warfare specialists. He also held discussions with the United Kingdom Maritime Component Commander, Commodore Tim Fraser.

Speaking after the visit, Commodore Walworth said:

RFALyme Bay’s work with the UK and US mine countermeasures forces in the Gulf is an obvious example of how the Royal Fleet Auxiliary is contributing directly to front line operations.

“OtherRFAvessels in this region have been used to undertake anti-piracy patrols, provide a base for the training of the Iraqi Navy and assist maritime security operations, and, of course, our traditional role of providing fuel and other essential supplies.”

Commodore Fraser added:

The Middle East maritime domain stands as one of the most important areas of operation for the UK Armed Forces. The support provided by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary allows our ships to remain on station for extended durations away from base support.RFAships have also participated in operations. For all these reasons, theRFAis very much a core component of the naval service.

In addition to Lyme Bay, there were three otherRFAvessels in the Middle East over the Christmas period. One of the longest serving vessels in the flotilla,RFABayleaf, acts as the Gulf’s ‘Ready Tanker’, supporting Royal Navy and coalition warships in the strategically-important waterway.

RFAFort Victoria has just completed a period of counter-piracy operations alongside international navies in the Somali Basin. During this time she played host to a detachment from the Fleet Protection Group Royal Marines, together with a Merlin helicopter from 820 Naval Air Squadron and an 18-man medical team. The multi-role replenishment vessel was instrumental in intercepting a number of suspected pirates.

Forward Repair ShipRFADiligence continues to provide maintenance support to Royal Navy assets in the region. She has also spent time assigned to Combined Task Force 150, a multinational counter-terrorism and maritime security mission. In this role Diligence contributed to the surveillance of various vessels of interest and undertook boarding exercises with warships from France, Pakistan and the United States.

Finally, no overview ofRFAoperations in the Gulf would be complete without includingRFACardigan Bay. She began her journey back to the UK earlier this month after spending over three years deployed in the Gulf.

She has been supporting the development and training of the fledgling Iraqi Navy as well as providing support to UK and US Navy units. Her versatility made her an ideal base for Iraqi Navy and Marines personnel as they were trained in tactical operations and basic seafaring. She has also routinely hosted the US Navy’s Maritime Expeditionary Security Force and their Cougar patrol craft. In addition, the ship acted as the afloat forward support base for all stores, mail and personnel transiting in and out of theatre and she became the venue of choice for visiting VIPs.

With HM Ships Cumberland and Cornwall recently taking up duties in the region - and HMS Iron Duke set to arrive shortly - the Royal Fleet Auxiliary will continue to be called upon by the Royal Navy east of Suez throughout 2011 and beyond.","Informational (public campaigns, nudging)",Informational,,id25_716

Mr…",Ministry of Defence,28 April 2011,"Garrison Sergeant Major William Mott has been responsible for some of the most spectacular state ceremonial events over the last decade.

Mr Mott has been in his current post as Garrison Sergeant Major (Warrant Officer Class 1) London District since July 2002. Officially responsible for state ceremonial duties, he has been involved in nearly every large-scale ceremonial event in London, and his job has taken him as far afield as Sri Lanka, Jamaica, Malaysia and Jordan in the organising of events.

As the post of Garrison Sergeant Major is traditionally a Court Appointment, the new badge has been approved especially by Her Majesty The Queen.

The badge revives the original one made for Sergeant Majors appointed to the Court of King William IV in the early 19th century. It incorporates the Royal Coat of Arms worn by selected Warrant Officers Class 1 of The Household Division, placed over four chevrons sewn in gold thread, the traditional badge of the Sergeant Major, originally worn on both arms of their tunics.

Mr Mott has received the badge in advance of one of his biggest jobs to date, the Royal Wedding of His Royal Highness Prince William and Catherine Middleton on 29 April.

His responsibilities include organising the lining of the processional route with over 1,000 troops from the Foot Guards Regiments, the Royal Navy and Royal Marines, and the Royal Air Force and their Bands.

Mr Mott has been seen regularly in the weeks in advance of the wedding day, marking out positions along the route with his Warrant Officer’s pace stick. He said:

It is a great honour for me as Garrison Sergeant Major London District that Her Majesty has approved the reinstatement of this historic badge.

I am continually humbled by the privileges which my appointment affords me, and the ‘big badge’ will be worn on my tunic with as much pride as I have worn every badge of rank in my Army service. That it is being worn for the first time in nearly 200 years for the Royal Wedding in the presence of Her Majesty makes it even more gratifying.

Garrison Sergeant Major Mott enlisted into the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards in April 1979, and has served with his unit in Belize, Canada, Cyprus, France, Germany, Kenya and the USA. He has completed operational tours of Northern Ireland and served in the Falklands during the 1982 conflict.

Alongside operational duties, he has served as an instructor at the Guards Depot as a Lance Sergeant, and at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst as a Colour Sergeant, a Company Sergeant Major and College Regimental Sergeant Major. He was Garrison Sergeant Major at Headquarters Northern Ireland prior to assuming his present appointment as Garrison Sergeant Major London District.

The post of Garrison Sergeant Major London District was established in the early 1950s with specific responsibilities as State Ceremonial Sergeant Major. The first task of the new Garrison Sergeant Major was to organise the funeral of King George VI in 1952 and the coronation of Her Majesty The Queen in 1953. There have since been five individuals who have held the post, including William Mott.

More than 1,300 personnel from across the Armed Forces will be playing a key role in the ceremonial elements of the Royal Wedding. This includes guard duties, lining the ceremonial route, musical support through ceremonial bands, and a spectacular seven-aircraft flypast from the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight and two Tornado and two Typhoon fast jets.",Meeting with Civil Servants and Discussion of Future Structure,Other,,id25_717
718,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/the-unstoppable-peace-process-in-nad-ali--2,News story,The 'unstoppable' peace process in Nad 'Ali,"As Nad 'Ali looks to a brighter future, Tristan Kelly reports from the former Taliban stronghold.",Ministry of Defence,6 January 2012,"With a reduction in violence of 86 per cent compared to 2010, the people who live in Nad ‘Ali district, an area once renowned for being a hotbed of the Taliban insurgency, are enjoying unprecedented levels of security.

And now, Afghan President Hamid Karzai has announced that the area, which is to the west of Lashkar Gah in Helmand province and within the British area of operations, will be among the second tranche of areas across the country to begin formal transfer to Afghan security control.

However, today’s relative security has been hard fought and some years in the making. British and other ISAF forces first entered the region in 2006.

Work soon began to disrupt and dislodge the Taliban from the region and in December 2008 a major operation - named SOND CHARA - was launched by British, Danish, Estonian and Afghan forces to clear insurgents from the district centre.

With two patrol bases quickly established, the operation was hailed a success and allowed ISAF and Afghan forces to move out from pockets of security to reassure the local population and offer a platform for stabilisation.

This foothold was expanded over time and culminated in Operation MOSHTARAK in February 2010. Meaning ‘together’ in Dari, Op MOSHTARAK was the largest counter-insurgency operation launched by ISAF forces since entering Afghanistan in 2001.

It involved some 15,000 ISAF troops from the UK, the US, Denmark, Estonia and Canada, as well as large numbers of Afghan troops.

The word ‘moshtarak’ underlined the key feature of the operation - the unprecedented and successful involvement of Afghan forces, including members of the Afghan National Army, Afghan National Police, Afghan Border Police and Afghan National Civil Order Police.

Speaking on the eve of the operation, Brigadier James Cowan, the then Commander of Task Force Helmand, said:

I can think of no better name to describe this venture. For we are in this together: we have planned it together, we will fight it together, we will see it through together.

Another key feature of the operational plan was ‘seeing it through’ and the Provincial Reconstruction Team and Afghan government departments were involved from the very beginning in bringing governance to the region as soon as the insurgents had been driven out:

We’ve got a government in a box, ready to roll in,” said US General Stanley McChrystal, ISAF commander at the time.

Jumping ahead 18 months and progress in Nad ‘Ali has been stark, with the reduction in violence taking some by surprise. This is particularly true in the southern half of the district, around the district centre.

Speaking at Patrol Base Chili in southern Nad ‘Ali, towards the end of his tour in September 2011, Major Jamie Murray, Officer Commanding B Company, 2nd Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles (2 RGR), whose area of operations covered approximately 25,000 of Nad ‘Ali’s population of 75,000-100,000, tells me just how quiet this tour has been:

The summer fighting season has been very much suppressed and the conditions are set for an informal transition,” he said, adding that significant events, such as IED finds and contacts with the Taliban, were down 40 per cent on the previous HERRICK.

And the Taliban, according to the Major, were becoming ‘desperate’, and with that the quality of the enemy had reduced. He cited a recent incident where a suicide bomber had self-detonated in a field a long way from his target in the district centre as a key example.

Major Murray adds that the focus of this tour has been much more on interaction with local Afghans and showing them the benefits of Afghan government control. He also says that there has been a dramatic shift in the attitude of local Afghans since 2 RGR’s previous tour in 2009:

We have conducted 75 shuras so far and each one is convivial,” Major Murray said.

The locals are willing to provide us with information not just about security but about their lives in general - a year ago that shura would have been entirely about security and things to do with life and death.

Now Afghan locals are telling us where bad things are happening, where IEDs are being laid. We now have well over 25,000 counter insurgents in this area, and that is the local people who are countering the insurgency.

The next day I join a routine joint 2 RGR and Afghan National Civil Order Police patrol into the nearby village of Shin Kalay, whose streets and recently restored mosque are buzzing with activity.

The Gurkhas speak freely in Hindi with the villagers and platoon commander Lieutenant Nick Gross is quick to strike up conversation with those in the busy alleyways separating the many compounds.

After a few quick handshakes and nods of recognition, Lieutenant Gross meets with one man he knows well, who explains how his brother has recently returned from the US and is keen to fund the reopening of the local school.

It is a small example of how life is returning to the area as confidence in security takes hold. Major Murray also tells me that local farmers are managing to coax four crops a year out of their fertile soils for the first time in decades.

Not far away, in Nad ‘Ali district centre, the bazaar has increased from the two or three shops of a year ago to over 100 today and the newly-metalled roads are allowing farmers to take their goods to market.

Asked how such a transformation has been achieved Major Murray says that sustained interaction and living amongst the locals, understanding them and what makes them tick, has been crucial.

He is keen to stress though that his men are simply building on the achievements of UK and Afghan troops on previous HERRICKs and the hard work invested in the area over several years.

Carrying the baton into the future will be the sole responsibility of the Afghans. Much of that responsibility will rest with the Afghan National Police (ANP) as the Afghan National Army (ANA) move to more outlying areas to take on the insurgency in the hinterland.

Leading the police from the newly-built District Police Headquarters in Nad ‘Ali is District Chief of Police Lieutenant Colonel Shahdi Khan, who said that he had ever-increasing confidence in his force:

We have enough men now and more importantly we have the trust of the people. When the people trust the ANP we can do anything,” he said.

Despite Lieutenant Colonel Khan’s optimism the quality and quantity of the Afghan security forces will determine the speed of transition and its eventual success or failure.

The issue is being tackled on several fronts, not least in the Lashkar Gah provincial police training centre. Here hundreds of new recruits - and importantly junior officers - are undergoing instruction.

Sergeant Glynn Ross of the Ministry of Defence Police, who has been training junior ANP officers in Helmand, said that while the police in Afghanistan have to know how to fight the insurgency, he is trying to focus heavily on traditional policing skills:

It is part of their mission here to gain the hearts and minds of the people, and if they do that they will be halfway there,” he said. “They are certainly going to be a good police service at the end of the day.

Compared with 18 months ago we are now turning out a much, much higher standard of recruit.

Progress at all levels - from the police to delivering infrastructure projects - has been lauded, and the formal process for transferring security control in Nad ‘Ali is another step on the road to full transition across the country by 2015 when ISAF combat operations will end.

This of course is not the end of the story. UK and other NATO troops will likely continue to offer training assistance to the Afghans after 2014 and Foreign Secretary William Hague has made clear that transition does not mean the end of international support:

The UK remains committed to a strong, long-term partnership with Afghanistan based on diplomacy, trade and development, and support for Afghan National Security Forces’ [ANSF] development,” he said.

General Sherin Shah, the commander of the 6,000 ANA troops that form 3rd Brigade 215 Corps, which cover the key Helmand districts of Lashkar Gah, Nahr-e Saraj, Nad ‘Ali and Gereshk, is bullish in his view of the future:

In Nad ‘Ali the ANSF will take over responsibility for security. The process of transition will take time, and it is not something that will happen overnight, but ISAF troops are not leaving us and will support us if we need it,” he said.

I have seen big changes in Nad ‘Ali in the past few years. Now there are shops, businesses and construction projects happening. Children can go to school to learn. The peace process will continue and nothing will stop us.",Confirmation of sitting volleyball team slots at London 2012,Institutional,,id25_718

Joined by her military counterpart, the Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir David Richards, the aim of the trip was to meet as many civilian and Service personnel working in as many different roles as possible.

The civil servants who the Permanent Secretary met are mostly serving operational tours of between six and 12 months, with the roles represented as diverse as scientists, police officers, commercial officers and communications specialists.

Beginning their trip in the Afghan capital Kabul, from where the NATO-led military operation is co-ordinated nationally, the party then flew to the main operating base in Lashkar Gah.

This is where the headquarters of Task Force Helmand, the lead formation of British troops in Afghanistan, is based, as well as the Foreign Office-led Helmand Provincial Reconstruction Team, which employs both civilian and military personnel and exists to promote economic and social development in the province.

They then travelled on to Camp Bastion, also in Helmand province and the largest British base in the country, stopping off at the smaller Forward Operating Base Shawqat and the even more remote Patrol Base Attal on the way.

The Permanent Secretary also visited her Afghan opposite number, the Afghan Ministry of Defence’s First Deputy Minister, and dropped in on a group of Afghan students taking the civil service training programme.

The course, taught by UK trainers who are preparing their Afghan equivalents to take over their roles, covers all the key skills new Afghan civil servants will need, including negotiation skills, leadership and the Civil Service Code of Conduct.

One of the key roles of British forces serving in Afghanistan is training and mentoring the Afghan National Security Forces, which will allow the process of ‘transition’ - the handing over of security responsibilities to the Afghans - to take place.

So Mrs Brennan and General Richards were shown around the Helmand Police Training Centre, where civilians from the Ministry of Defence Police and troops from 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland are involved in training up the next generation of Afghan police.

The Permanent Secretary has visited Afghanistan twice before in her previous role as 2nd Permanent Under Secretary at the Department, and noticed significant changes since her last trip.

She said:

What is really striking on my third visit to Afghanistan is the progress that’s been made and the focus on transition. I’ve been really struck on this visit by the civilian-military effort that’s going on and by the enormous improvements that are being made through the use of advanced technology that are really enabling the troops on the ground.

Whilst here, I’ve seen the Provincial Reconstruction Team [PRT] in Helmand. It’s really good to hear General Petraeus say that it’s the best PRT in Afghanistan. The range of talent that they’ve drawn together there is absolutely remarkable and it’s one of the real strengths of the PRT. It’s real evidence of the professionalism of civilians and military working together.

General Richards said:

I’ve never seen the Armed Forces so motivated and capable as it is today, and that has been summed up perfectly on this visit. You judge Armed Forces on the basis of whether or not they can do the job they are being asked to do and, my goodness me, this is an Armed Forces that’s at the top of its game.

MOD staff who met the Permanent Secretary were pleased to see the Department’s two top people make the trip out to Afghanistan, particularly at this time of significant change in Defence.

Dr Eluned Lewis, who is based in Lashkar Gah as the Deputy Scientific Advisor to the UK military, said:

For the Permanent Secretary to take time out of her busy schedule to visit MOD civilians in theatre was a very welcome gesture. She showed genuine interest in the civilian effort in Afghanistan and made me feel that my work here is supported and appreciated at senior level.

She welcomed our questions and comments and answered with honesty and compassion. She was very approachable and down to earth, and I was very pleased to have the opportunity to meet with her. I hope she relays a positive message back in London about the civilian effort in supporting operations.

Ben Wilkinson, who is deployed as the Civilian Media Advisor at Headquarters Task Force Helmand, said:

In a climate in which it’s not uncommon to hear very negative comments, dismissing all MOD civil servants as pen-pushers who spend their days stuck behind a desk, I thought it was valuable and a significant morale-boost to see the top civilian in the Department come here and show a genuine interest in the roles we play - all of which contribute to the operation.

The Permanent Secretary seemed very interested to hear what we thought about cost-savings measures being implemented at the moment and took a lot of time to explain the rationale behind them, how they are working, and how they might affect us. She was also keen to hear our views on the future shape of the MOD and how things could be done more effectively and efficiently in the future.

Edward Holder, Policy Advisor to Commander Task Force Helmand, said:

I am finding my deployment to be both professionally and personally rewarding; however, like most of us out here, I am concerned about the future opportunities for working in a post-Strategic Defence and Security Review MOD.

The meeting we had with the Permanent Secretary was useful in getting a clearer idea of what to expect in the coming months and how the MOD is likely to be structured in the future.

This will be the first time ever that Great Britain will have both men’s and women’s teams represented at a Paralympic Games.

The selected athletes include Lance Corporal Netra Rana, a Gurkha who was injured on patrol in Afghanistan and who has come through the MOD’s Battle Back programme; Charlie Walker, who lost his legs after contracting meningitis; and Sam Bowen, a former soldier who lost a leg in a mortar attack in Iraq.

Lance Corporal Netra Rana has been selected by the British Paralympic Association to compete in the men's sitting volleyball team for London 2012 [Picture: Sergeant Russ Nolan RLC, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]

Lance Corporal Rana was knocked unconscious for two days and sustained multiple injuries when his vehicle hit an improvised explosive device south of Kandahar in Afghanistan on 21 January 2008.

When LCpl Rana regained consciousness back in the UK his left leg had been amputated below the knee and he was suffering from multiple wounds to his right leg and lower back, where two discs had fused.

LCpl Rana is able to walk for half-an-hour with the use of a prosthetic leg before his ‘good’ leg causes him too much pain, and has found the camaraderie of volleyball to be of great value to his rehabilitation.

He has become a valuable member of the men’s team and was awarded the prize for Most Valuable Player at the 2011 Continental Cup. He said:

It has been a hard rehabilitation process for me but sitting volleyball has helped me physically and emotionally.

I am very proud to be selected into the squad and I will be honoured to take to the court in the summer with my team mates to represent Great Britain and make my country and family proud.

We cannot wait to get in front of the home crowd and show them what a great sport sitting volleyball is.

Charlie Walker left the Army after he contracted meningitis. The disease resulted in both legs being amputated below the knee.

He said:

I suppose it really is something of an irony to lose your legs in that way when you run the risk of being blown up.

I first became ill in 2006 and spent two years going in and out of hospital. My legs were in a terrible state and doctors decided that one should be amputated. Then they told me they would have to take the second.

I was devastated because I had always wanted to play rugby or some sport to the highest level.

Charlie hopes that this year’s Paralympic Games will help to raise the profile of disability sports:

I think many people in this country don’t know too much about sports such as sitting volleyball and the Paralympic Games. In the past there hasn’t been such great interest, but hopefully now things are slowly changing.

As well as playing club matches for Surrey Sitting Volleyball Club, Charlie hopes to work in prosthetics in the future.

A former soldier with 32 Regiment Royal Artillery, Sam Bowen launched and operated state-of-the-art drones which flew above the battlefields of southern Iraq carrying out surveillance.

On 15 May 2006 she suffered severe wounds when razor-sharp shrapnel entered her right leg, which she subsequently lost, and back when militants fired more than 30 mortar rounds at her regiment’s base in Al Amarah.

Prior to London 2012, only standing volleyball teams have competed for Great Britain in the Paralympics.

But theBPAhas worked closely with Volleyball England to ensure that sitting volleyball met all credible performance requirements before confirming, in September 2011 for the men and March 2012 for the women, that the sport would receive home country slots at London 2012.

Yesterday’s announcement confirms the athletes who will compete in those teams.

Penny Briscoe, Deputy Chef de Mission (Performance) of the Paralympics Great Britain team, said:

I am very proud of these athletes. We have always been clear that there are no free tracksuits; in order to be selected for ParalympicsGB you have to demonstrate that you have got what it takes to compete on the biggest stage in disability sport.

Five years ago there was no sitting volleyball programme in the UK, so the sport has come on hugely in the last few years.

TheBPAhas worked very hard with the athletes and staff on this team, including helping them identify athletes at our Paralympic potential days and providing additional support and education through our Talent Transition Programme.

It is as a result of our combined efforts that we can now announce these athletes, and I’m proud that all of our hard work has paid off.

Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, met the players yesterday at City Hall as part of the team announcement event. He said:

The ParalympicsGB sitting volleyball team has a truly inspiring line-up of athletes who demonstrate the phenomenal power that sport has in bringing people together.

Led by Captain Lowe, the event took place at the headquarters of the 2nd Kandak of the Afghan National Police (ANP), beside Delta Company’s home, Patrol Base Attal, east of Helmand’s provincial capital Lashkar Gah.

Captain Lowe spent time educating local nationals on better ways to carry out animal husbandry in an initiative that proved to be very popular; approximately 60 people attended on the first day and more than 100 on the second.

Captain Lowe said:

The aim of these two days was to educate the local people on modern methods of animal husbandry practices and medical care. This knowledge will help to make them more self-reliant and also help to improve their livelihoods.

The event, the first of its nature carried out by Delta Company during their seven-month tour of Helmand, was considered a real success.

In addition, Captain Lowe and localANPcommander Colonel Abdul Sattar Noorzai, who also played a key role in setting up the event, spoke on Radio Nahr-e Saraj, which transmits from Patrol Base Attal, on both evenings of the project, fielding veterinary questions from local farmers who telephoned into the station.

Colonel Noorzai said:

This kind of education is very important for improving life for the people. I have emphasised how beneficial this is on the local radio station so future events will see even more people attend.

Captain Niall Archibald of 5 SCOTS added:

The Veterinary Teaching Initiative is one of many different projects being run as part of Afghan Government and ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) efforts to increase the self-sufficiency of Afghanistan’s population. The future of the country lies in the hands of its people, and initiatives such as this provide the tools to help build it up.

Delta Company are partnered with the Afghan National Police, protecting the people of Lashkar Gah district and ensuring that they have a responsible and accountable police force.

They also assist theANPin gathering information on insurgents in the area and conduct operations to ensure that the insurgents are unable to impact on the daily life of the people.

724,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/parliamentarians-learn-the-ropes-at-defence-academy,News story,Parliamentarians learn the ropes at Defence Academy,Last week the Defence Academy at Shrivenham played host to twenty-five politicians and Members of Parliament as part of the Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme (AFPS).,Ministry of Defence,22 February 2012,"The two-day stay at the internationally-acclaimed centre of excellence for defence study combined briefings, discussions and a few hands-on practical demonstrations.

The parliamentarians had explained to them the role of the military in a democracy and the MOD as a Department of State, and how the ‘casualty chain’ works, basically the method by which seriously injured troops are returned to the UK.

They were also confronted with an array of weaponry including Kalashnikovs, SA80s and Timberwolf sniper rifles, which some of them were able to try out on the firing range.

Newcomer to the scheme, West Midlands MEP Nikki Sinclaire, said she found it fascinating to hear from the families of Armed Forces personnel and learn of their particular needs and challenges.

Education and health for these family members were high on her agenda when she said ‘if Jill’s not happy then neither is Jack!’, referring to the importance of personnel deploying overseas being content in the knowledge they are leaving their families in a safe and secure environment. She added:

It’s good to hear that these issues are being addressed by local authorities.

The AFPS was founded in 1988, the brainchild of Sir Neil Thorne.

Concerned at the lack of subject knowledge displayed by MPs whilst debating defence issues, Sir Neil, a former gunner, quickly identified the urgent need to educate politicians and give them a clear insight into the structure of Defence, the interface between military and civilian personnel, and the unique workings, ethos and lifestyle of the Armed Forces.

There was a time when the majority of standing MPs would have served in one of the arms of the British military, but with National Service having been phased out some fifty years ago, ‘insider’ knowledge of military service fell to a sprinkling of MPs who had had a former career in uniform.

However, in recent years, the Armed Forces’ torch has been carried in Parliament by a number of high-profile individuals, such as distinguished former Colonel and Commander of British troops in Bosnia, Bob Stewart, now MP for Beckenham.

From its fledgling roots back in 1988 the scheme has grown, and today there are four tiers, each given an associated rank equating to Major, Lieutenant Colonel, Colonel and Brigadier (equivalent ranks in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force are given to those politicians wishing to align with these Services).

There are five members per tier with the opportunity for ‘graduation’ up through the ranks!

Sir Neil said:

It was important to pitch the associated rank at the right level so MPs got to see life as it is for the personnel on the ground as opposed to a politician visiting the Armed Forces and getting the VIP treatment.

Member of the House of Lords Ian McColl (Lord McColl of Dulwich), a former surgeon, enjoyed handling the weapons at the firing range:

The last time a fired a rifle was back in 1951 when I was a cadet at school; back then it was .303s and .22s,” he said.

Speaking about the scheme and the visit to the Academy in particular he said:

It’s a marvellous set-up; very enjoyable and educational. It’s so important to have people in Parliament with an understanding of such an important subject. I’m fascinated by how policy is communicated and the way public opinion is highly regarded.

The briefing on Operation ELLAMY, Britain’s contribution to the multinational task force deployed to Libya, greatly interested Lord McColl as he revealed:

Some years ago, about the time of the US bombing of Tripoli, I was called to operate on Gaddafi’s 103-year-old father, or so they claimed, he looked older to me! Ashen faces befell the whole surgical team as Colonel Gaddafi, wearing his trademark silver-plated automatic pistols, ominously asked me how the procedure had gone.","Synchronicity, focus, and a joint understanding of the required approach",Other,,id25_724

During his visit he was shown armoured vehicles, surveillance aids and communication equipment and he also took the opportunity to present a number of awards and a medal.

RAF Honington is home to 1, II, 15, 26 and 27 Squadrons of the RAF Regiment, the Defence Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Wing, 2623 Squadron Royal Auxiliary Air Force Regiment, the 1st Royal Tank Regiment and a medical Regional Rehabilitation Unit.

It is also home to the RAF Regiment’s Force Headquarters, its Training Wing and the RAF’s Force Protection Centre.

Group Captain Andrew Hall, RAF Honington’s Station Commander, said:

It has been an immense honour to have His Royal Highness visit us today. RAF Honington, being the home of the RAF Regiment and broader defence outputs, has a proud story to tell.

Our people have been delighted with the opportunity to link up with their Honorary Air Commandant and to share their experiences.

He has met a complete cross-section of our community, including the families of those who are on operations, and has spent time with those preparing to deploy.

Coinciding with the 70th anniversary of the RAF Regiment, ‘fighting on the ground for control of the air’, this has been a most memorable occasion.

Jackie Hall, the wife of the Station Commander, said:

It was a great honour, we as a family felt very privileged.

726,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/isaf-plans-for-afghanistan-on-course-and-unchanged,News story,ISAF plans for Afghanistan on course and unchanged,"Major General Nick Pope, who has recently taken over as the Chief of the Defence Staff's Strategic Communications Officer, briefed members of the media yesterday on the situation in Afghanistan.",Ministry of Defence,10 June 2011,"He introduced Lieutenant General David Rodriguez of the US Army, Commander of ISAF Joint Command, and Major General Tim Evans, Chief of Staff ISAF Joint Command, who both spoke to the audience via a video conferencing link from Kabul.

General Rodriguez said that ISAF objectives in Afghanistan continue to be the denial of sanctuary to Al-Qaeda and the prevention of a Taliban resurgence in the country:

To do this we will continue to destroy or degrade the insurgents’ infrastructure, build the Afghan National Security Forces until they are strong enough to take the lead in providing security in their country, and ultimately mobilise the people to stand up against their enemies,” he said.

To achieve this, a unique plan is being put into practice, and has proved its effectiveness over the last year. Because the majority of the population lives in less than a third of the country, the focus of the plan is on key areas such as population centres, meeting places and the routes connecting them. The intention is to establish capable security and good governance, and to develop the people to deliver and sustain this.

General Rodriguez explained the details of the countrywide campaign plan which has been given the name Operation OMID, which means ‘hope’ in Dari.

This plan was made in co-operation with our Afghan partners, and it was they who selected the name, because the desired result will be greater hope in the hearts and heads of the people,” said General Rodriguez.

The campaign began last year in the central Helmand River valley as this was the nexus of the narcotics industry which partially funded the insurgency, and it was also an insurgent stronghold:

Our Pakistan partners said it was Taliban central,” said the General. “This year, because of a lot of hard work and sacrifice, much of the area is now stable. The insurgents have been pushed back to the edges of the valley and into the north.

The focus of the main effort is now to the east near Kandahar. Areas of security are being expanded and connected to those already established in the central Helmand valley.

General Rodriguez described the district of Arghandab as a good example of progress. Districts such as this around Kandahar have traditionally been very tough places to be ever since coalition forces arrived.

In 2009, Arghandab was a Taliban stronghold where people could not move around without fear:

In January last year the district governor was killed, the district police chief was maimed, and there were no government officials present among the people, except at the district centre, which the locals described as a combat outpost as all it did was defend itself,” said the General.

I was just down there recently, and there were 16 government employees working with a new district governor, and there is a new police chief, whose police force is visible and responsive to the people,” he continued. “There is also a local shura that represents the people and which holds their government accountable.

A more visible example of change is the preponderance of local people picnicking on a Friday afternoon along the Arghandab River valley, a sight which would not have been seen a year ago.

General Rodriguez said that changes such as these were happening throughout the country where ISAF, in partnership with the Afghan security forces, were focusing their efforts:

The Afghan security forces are in the lead, demonstrating to the people that their security forces will be able to secure the population as their capability expands across the country.

We will continue to expand the Kabul security zone to the east and to the south. We have a long way to go in the eastern region. It contains the most difficult human and physical terrain,” he said.

General Rodriguez added that, for many areas, security is improving significantly and that ISAF should be able to ‘thin their forces’ in some areas in the near future:

Just a couple of weeks ago, in the north, we lost a very influential Afghan leader, the regional police chief General Dawood, as well as the provincial chief of police and several coalition force members.

These attacks are intended to degrade the trust between the coalition and the Afghan security forces, and intimidate the people in the hope that it will make them believe their security forces cannot protect them. But, so far, the strong partnership between the Afghan security forces and the coalition remains very strong, and in many places the Afghans aren’t buying the story that their security forces can’t protect them,” said the General.

In fact, the day after a multiple, co-ordinated attack by the Taliban in Kandahar, the locals were out and about conducting their business as usual.

The General talked about Herat city as another example of progress. He described it as a bustling city, largely free from violent incident, and ready to start the transition process to Afghan leadership this summer:

Yes there was an attack there recently,” he said, “but the Afghan forces did not allow the enemy to breach their intended target. This is a trend we are seeing more and more across the country; the increasing confidence, courage and ability of both the police and the army to render the insurgent ineffective.

The General said that the plan which had been implemented last year had required synchronicity, focus, and a joint understanding of the required approach, but it was clear that the combined team had the required momentum to make further defeats on the enemy, and that progress was indisputable.

ISAF Joint Command Chief of Staff, Major General Tim Evans, explained that approximately 200 staff from the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, a UK-led NATO HQ based in Gloucestershire, are currently augmenting the ISAF Joint Command staff, and would continue to do so until January 2012. He said that the 1,500 staff at ISAF HQ are divided into cross-functional teams focusing on current operations, the here and now, future operations looking out to about three months, and future plans ranging out as far as two years’ hence.

General Evans explained that during the winter months there had been a conscious decision to take the fight to the insurgents, concentrating on their command and control, their support basis and their infiltration routes:

We have relentlessly pursued the insurgents,” he said, “and we have captured over 1,000 insurgents in the last five months.

This represents a 250 per cent increase on the numbers captured during the same period last year:

This has had such an impact that it has created friction among the various factions, resulting in the commanders based in Pakistan not wanting to venture into Afghanistan while expecting their subordinates to stay and fight,” said General Evans.

He explained that all operations are carried out in partnership with the Afghan forces and that about 20 per cent of those were in fact Afghan-led:

We have also seen a 300 per cent increase in the number of weapons caches found compared to a similar period last year. For example we have found 2,900 caches since January.

Many of these finds had been made by the Afghan security forces themselves, often having been identified by local people:

This surely is a sign of the increasing confidence that the people have in their security forces, and a rejection of the insurgency,” said General Evans.

The narcotics industry, including the laboratories, infiltration routes and supply routes, have also been targeted over the winter months:

We are certainly still on the offensive, consolidating our gains, strengthening local governance and protecting the population,” concluded the General.

He acknowledged that there was still much to do, and that such a proactive policy would probably mean more fighting in the summer, but added it was clear that the Afghan people were ‘up for the fight’.",Public consultation and response to comments,Informational,,id25_726

The exercise included using night-vision goggles to treat soldiers in pitch black conditions, carrying out casualty evacuations with the support of a helicopter, learning mental and dental healthcare skills, and, crucially, working with a team of trained professional amputee actors from the UK to provide a realistic training environment.

Corporal Leah Burchett, who serves with the Germany-based Queen’s Royal Hussars, was attached to 1 Medical Regiment during the exercise and will deploy to Afghanistan with the unit:

This has been extremely realistic, bringing everything we have learned together,” she said. “We have worked in similar teams to those we will be in in Afghanistan. It’s good to know that we can work both together and individually. We have had access to a lot of different doctors with a huge amount of experience - which has been a real bonus.

Working in the darkness with the night-vision goggles has also been useful, it’s frustrating working at night, but in Afghanistan we won’t only be working in the daylight, we need to get used to treating people in the darkness. I will always make sure I have a torch on me.

The medics were joined by a team of actors from UK agency Amputees in Action, who use their personal trauma experiences and realistic make-up and prosthetics to simulate the kind of injuries that might happen on tour. They remain in character throughout a scenario to ensure the training experience is intense and realistic, helping improve performance in the treatment of catastrophic injuries in the field and allowing essential techniques to become innate and instinctive.

Corporal Burchett, who joined the Army in 2005 and served in Iraq in 2007, will now spend the weeks leading up to her deployment refining and practising all the essential drills and skills she will need in a series of exercises and training opportunities. She added:

The amputees have been a huge benefit. At first it was a shock, they are really good actors, especially with the make-up and prosthetics, they should be given Oscars. They adapt as we treat them, reacting to what we do which is much more realistic than working on a dummy.

If I encounter soldiers with similar injuries in Afghanistan I won’t be so shocked and will be able to get on with my job helping them. The feedback from the amputees is really useful; they let you know what you are doing right and what you are doing wrong.

I will also be able to draw on my experience from Iraq which was a really busy tour. I will probably be based in one of the forward operating bases in Afghanistan, and may also provide medical back up for our commanding officer. I want to go there, I’ve never been before. It will be an excellent and very useful experience. I need to do it as a soldier; it will be a personal test.

While all British soldiers receive general training in how to treat injuries in an operational theatre, Army medics who are fully trained in how to deliver medical care in some of the most stressful and dangerous combat situations are often assigned to accompany infantiers on patrols and on guard to provide medical support.

They also run specially set up medical centres in Afghanistan, working alongside doctors to provide the full range of primary healthcare needs to military personnel and helping to train medics in the Afghan National Army.

Captain Nick Davies, Intelligence Officer for the UK Joint Force Medical Group, said:

The Regiment has trained hard for months in the mission specific training build-up to this year’s deployment on Operation HERRICK 15 in Afghanistan. The members of the Regiment are fully prepared and are looking forward to performing their duties in theatre. Their battle worthiness has been comprehensively tested, including physical conditioning, leadership, soldiering skills, specialist skills, and values and standards.

This Role 1 Clinical Validation Exercise is the prime opportunity to display the fruits of months of preparation and to hone the clinical skills of our soldiers in challenging serials and realistic theatre-specific scenarios.

Cultural training and a firm understanding of the socio-political issues that exist within Helmand province has provided our soldiers with the confidence and knowledge to effectively manage the Afghan human terrain and the sensitive issues that arise across the continuum of care on operations.",Investment in Astute and Successor Class submarines and Raynesway plant refurbishment,Monetary,Fiscal incentives,id25_727

Its online version enabled people to enter public discussion of the programme and, until 10 June 2010, people were invited to submit comments.

Over 9,500 comments were published, showing a commitment by members of the public, from all political persuasions and all walks of life, to shape the debate on the country’s future.

There were lively and informed debates on subjects as diverse as climate change, foreign policy and badger culling.

Each Department has published a response to the comments for each section today, explaining the Government’s position on the most popular subjects and setting out the next steps in realising the programme’s vision.

Here follows the Defence response to public comments on The Coalition: our programme for government:

After 12 years without a defence review, when our Armed Forces have at times been overstretched, with legacy equipment programmes from the Cold War, and in our current financial circumstances, we are now undertaking a long overdue Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) against three core principles:

Relevance: Defence posture and capabilities must be relevant to the world we live in, dispensing with much of the Cold War legacy.

Realism: We cannot insure against every imaginable risk so we must decide which risks we are willing to take.

Responsibility: the nation has a duty to support our Service personnel. We are determined to ensure they have what they need to do what we ask of them, and that they and their families are looked after properly.

Economic strength sustains in the long-term the capabilities we need, including military capabilities, to keep our citizens safe and maintain our influence on the world stage.

Economic stability and prosperity in Britain is the top priority for the Government and is at the heart of the coalition agreement. The national finances today are severely constrained by the huge budget deficit left by the previous Government which threatens the health of our economy.

We must therefore cut spending and Defence cannot be immune from this. The future defence programme we inherited is entirely unaffordable, especially if we tried to do what we need to do in the future while simultaneously doing everything in the way we do it today.

But whatever the specific outcomes of the SDSR, we will ensure procurement delivers effectively and that the UK has robust and well equipped Armed Forces able to protect our security and interests at home and abroad.

At the moment our Armed Forces are engaged in a vital struggle in Afghanistan to ensure that trans-national terrorists cannot find safe and unhindered sanctuary there as they did before 9/11. We are resolved to see the mission through and to train the Afghan National Security Forces so that they can take over the security of their country and our forces can come home.

But where we can, we seek to avoid conflict. Deterrence is key to this, and the nuclear deterrent is fundamental to our ability to deter the most destructive forms of aggression. We will continue to press for continued progress on multilateral disarmament.

But in an unpredictable world where we cannot see very far into the future, where nuclear weapons will not be disinvented, where we are seeing wider proliferation, we will not gamble with the country’s future. We will therefore maintain the UK’s essential minimum deterrent.

The capital costs of the successor programme are likely to be up to £20bn; that is a small proportion of government expenditure. But where we can reduce the costs we will, which is why we are scrutinising Trident’s renewal to ensure value for money.

In a video posted on the Programme for Government website, Danny Alexander, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said:

The response has been fantastic and I’m pleased to see people have really engaged with this process.

I hope people will see that this is different, it’s a permanent change to the way we run government, and that it is worthwhile engaging in this kind of process in the future. It’s important for us in government to remember we don’t have all the answers.

The Astute Class vessels are the largest, most advanced, and most powerful attack submarines ever operated by the Royal Navy. They are nuclear-powered but not nuclear-armed.

The investment, awarded to Rolls-Royce in a £1.1bn contract, will also fund an eleven-year refurbishment of Rolls-Royce’s plant at Raynesway in Derby, extending its operating life by more than 40 years.

The contract, which secures 300 jobs at Rolls-Royce, will see construction of new buildings to replace existing facilities that have reached the end of their useful lives.

Replacing the existing infrastructure with the advanced nuclear reactor core production facilities will cost around £500m. A further £600m will be spent on producing new reactor cores for the Astute and Successor Class submarines.

Announcing the contract, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said:

Having balanced the MOD’s books we can now invest in vital strategic capabilities to meet the present and future defence needs of the UK.

This contract will secure hundreds of highly-skilled jobs for UK industry, while retaining our sovereign nuclear capability.

The Raynesway site has played a key part in the production and maintenance of our nuclear deterrent for more than 50 years. This regeneration will make sure it continues to do so for many years to come.

The MOD’s Director of Submarines, Rear Admiral Simon Lister, said:

I am very pleased that this contract has been signed as it will ensure that our future submarines are powered with the very best reactor cores.

Raynesway is a centre of excellence for nuclear reactor core production and the site works to stringent health and safety practices.

The site has an excellent safety record and this investment will make sure that the very highest standards of nuclear and conventional safety continue to be maintained.

Currently spread across a number of sites, the £690 million Corsham New Environment Programme will unite the team in one location at Basil Hill in Corsham, Witshire. It is being delivered through a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) construction project managed by Defence Estates (DE).

With many DE&S ISS staff currently housed in a HQ built during the Second World War at Basil Hill, a huge modern office complex - which will provide 1874 workspaces - will give them a purpose-built, contemporary environment to work in.

Alongside the new offices, the programme will build new living accommodation at the site to house 180 Service personnel, including those working for DE&S. A sports hall with improved facilities is also under construction.

Haydn Fowler, Deputy Head of the CNE Transition for DE&S and DE’s customer for the programme, points to its benefits - for both the MOD and the taxpayer.

By moving on to one site, we gain financial efficiencies and we can release some properties into the market place that the MOD no longer needs. We also become more efficient and effective, reducing duplication of roles and improving communication between teams.

The co-location of living accommodation and technical facilities at Basil Hill reflects the operational nature of the site. The Global Operations Security Control Centre (GOSCC) manages all Defence communication channels 24-hours-a-day,365 days a year, including those which support operational theatres and keep them connected to the UK.

In operational terms, ISS are responsible for delivering the kit that our Armed Forces need, including all the latest communications systems required for hostile environments such as Afghanistan,” says Haydn.

The site’s critical operational role, and the implication of any breaks in communications in theatre, has presented some challenges for the redevelopment project.

During construction, we must ensure that nothing goes down in the event of a power cut. So we’re quite worried about the diggers going into certain areas, because of the cables they might cut. We work very closely with the DE team on this, to make sure it can’t happen.

We’re at the stage where the roofs and the floors are done now, so it’s down to details. That means the smaller parts of the programme must all be wired up in time with the construction – and that includes lots of things that could potentially trip us up, such as telephones and computers.

Haydn is confident that the results will repay the huge amount of effort which has gone into the project.

The redevelopment, particularly the office complex, will be a catalyst for ongoing change. It’s something I think we’re going to be very proud of when it’s done.",Major Projects Review Board (MPRB),Institutional,Administrative,id25_730

Report by Sarah Goldthorpe.,Ministry of Defence,14 February 2012,"2 Military Intelligence Battalion is now functioning as the British Armed Forces’ exploitation unit - a responsibility that puts the formation in charge of ensuring key enemy information is used to the military’s best advantage.

The tri-Service collective will focus on materiel and personnel exploitation in Afghanistan, getting troops onto the ground to assist the fight against IEDs while providing legally-sound evidence to the country’s justice system.

Speaking ahead of a flag-raising ceremony at the battalion’s new home in Trenchard Lines, Upavon, Captain Colin Joyce of the Intelligence Corps explained the challenge:

This unit has taken a number of our battalion’s forensic technical capabilities such as biometrics, fingerprinting and examination of media devices and weapons and put them under one roof.

This will help to provide a complete evidential picture of captured or suspected insurgents.

The new role appears to resemble something from the ‘Crime Scene Investigation’ (CSI) TV franchise and a short word with personnel indicates this analogy is not a million miles from the truth.

Lance Corporal Gary Atkinson, also of the Intelligence Corps, works within level one of the exploitation process.

Once deployed, it is his job to work alongside bomb disposal teams to collect pressure plates, battery packs, mobile phones, rifles or any other object recovered during patrols or incidents:

All devices come through us at some point,” Lance Corporal Atkinson explained, “so everything done at this level has to be forensically-sound; that means we wear gloves and face masks.

We will never touch anything IED-wise unless it has been cleared by the bomb disposal guys first, but it’s one of the few roles in the Intelligence Corps where you are out on the ground in the thick of the action and that’s exciting.

We go anywhere and everywhere in Helmand and never get bored.

Of the wide-ranging devices inspected by this team to garner war-winning information, something as inconspicuous as a battered Coke bottle can demand the CSI treatment.

You will always find these types of devices out there because they are so easy to make.

Insurgents come up with different ways of using them - from ones with high metal content to those that can defeat detector capabilities.

As well as aiding the country’s legal system, consolidating the Army’s forensic facilities will ensure that lifesaving detail on enemy weapons can be fed to both front line troops and those back home developing protective kit:

We write reports on what we have found and run threat briefings to let battle groups and infantry commanders know the main dangers,” Lance Corporal Atkinson said.

We can also put out flash warnings if something new is discovered.

We like to look at it all like the military CSI but I am not sure it is quite as glam here as it is on the television screen.

Among the various forensics equipment used by soldiers in this role, the HazMat ID kit impresses its users every time.

Worth around £45,000, this unexciting-looking box can identify every single chemical component of a substance placed on its surface:

Even with coffee, this thing will tell you if it is caffeinated or decaffeinated,” Lance Corporal Atkinson boasted. “We know, we have tried!

In conflict, such substances could be the explosives or drugs that fuel the enemy:

This job is not just about weapons, it’s also the human element,” said Lance Corporal Peter Marsden, Royal Logistic Corps.

My role is getting out and collecting, but if guys at level two can bring DNA off whatever we find, we would want to know about that.

Personnel at the second and third levels of the exploitation process pull apart, download and dig into recovered articles to derive any information they can - be it DNA, geographical or technological intelligence.

Whether undertaken at the UK’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory or further afield, their endeavours allow extensive data to be absorbed into the Army’s knowledge base.

Outlining the crucial counter-intelligence function of the new unit and its clever computers, Warrant Officer Class 2 Jonathan Webster of the Intelligence Corps said:

We can conduct exploitation of computers, networks and other aspects of the internet to get information, such as using social networks for example.

Opening up a compact case containing every mobile phone charger imaginable, he explained the unit’s ability to take call logs and texts off any model - even the fakes:

We process that information, for example who has called and when, and make links to key events to construct a picture of who is talking to who,” he added.

Unsurprisingly, this group’s efforts are not solely focused on the HERRICK mission.

While mobiles are pulled apart in the desert, other team members are busy keeping on top of technological advances that could aid future intelligence-gathering - fridges that connect to the internet, Kindles and the latest GPS equipment all hold possibilities.

But until 2014, the exploitation unit’s focus will remain firmly on Helmand province.

Commanding Officer Lieutenant Colonel Mark Proctor said:

We are concentrating on Afghanistan currently but looking to form training teams to teach other countries about exploitation as well.

We lend such a small number of people but are providing them 365-days-a-year.

Once we stop Op HERRICK, that allows us to move onto contingency, but for now it’s about making sure whatever we do is for the Afghans.

We need to keep lessons from Helmand province so that, wherever we go next, our unit is there from the beginning.

732,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secretary-confirms-first-project-of-concern,News story,Defence Secretary confirms first project of concern,"Defence Secretary Dr Liam Fox has, for the first time, announced that a major ongoing defence project is considered to be underperforming and has been placed on the Projects of Concern list.",Ministry of Defence and The Rt Hon Philip Hammond,3 October 2011,"The Valiant Jetty project, awarded to AMEC plc in 2003, is nearly four years late, and some estimates put it running at £92m over cost.

The move to identify it as a project of concern comes after it was reviewed during the second meeting of the Major Projects Review Board (MPRB) that holds the top 50 equipment projects, with a total value of more than £100bn, to account.

The MPRB was established by the Defence Secretary last June to deliver tighter financial controls across the Department.

This week, the committee reviewed the Falcon communications system, the Watchkeeper surveillance system, and the Valiant Jetty project, which will serve the new Astute Class submarines at HM Naval Base Clyde.

Dr Fox said:

It is clear that the additional rigour and scrutiny being applied through the Major Projects Review Board is having a beneficial effect on the behaviours of our suppliers.

I am pleased that both Falcon and Watchkeeper have made progress since the Board’s first meeting. However, I am not satisfied with the progress of the Valiant Jetty project. It is almost four years late and over budget.

We must learn from the mistakes of the past and move away from the culture of optimism. Too frequently projects ran over-budget and over-time, without any meaningful remedial action. Real budgetary discipline can only be achieved through the effective real-time control of project budgets. Our Armed Forces and our country simply cannot afford anything less.

The Valiant Jetty project will deliver base porting facilities for the UK submarine fleet for the next 50 years. Its contract states that the project should have been completed in October 2008. AMEC’s estimate of earliest completion is now nearly four years after then, and their latest cost estimate is almost 70 per cent more than the contractual maximum price of £134m, though this is subject to ongoing negotiation.

The project will therefore be reviewed again at the next MPRB meeting in December. It will continue to remain under close scrutiny until sufficient progress has been made and this important capability is delivered.

The purpose of the MPRB is to provide rigorous senior oversight of the Department’s major projects, to identify those that are in danger of failing, and to take decisive action either to get a project back on track or, if necessary, to terminate it. Its membership comprises the Secretary of State, the Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology, the Chief of Defence Materiel, and the Deputy Chief of Defence Staff (Capability).

The MPRB has met twice. So far it has considered three projects in detail, of which one has been identified as a project of concern. Other projects will be considered at future meetings.

The Falcon project recently passed an important milestone and, while there is still work to be done, the Board is satisfied that it can be kept under review below the level of the MPRB.

Watchkeeper has made some progress since the last MPRB, but, given the importance of delivering this capability to Afghanistan and the residual risk, the MPRB will look at it again around the turn of the year.",Introduction of grey and purple hackles for the Territorial Army battalions,Administrative,,id25_732
733,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/governor-mangal-reports-on-progress-in-helmand,News story,Governor Mangal reports on progress in Helmand,"Speaking to journalists during a visit to London, Mr Mangal, who has been Helmand governor since May 2008, spoke of his pride in the position…",Ministry of Defence,4 November 2010,"Speaking to journalists during a visit to London, Mr Mangal, who has been Helmand governor since May 2008, spoke of his pride in the position, but joked that many would know it as the ‘insecure province of Afghanistan’.

He therefore began by stressing just how much progress ISAF and Afghan forces had achieved in securing the province over the last 24 months and diminishing the influence of insurgents.

Speaking through an interpreter, Mr Mangal said:

About two years ago out of 13 districts in Helmand Province only six were under Government control - and when I say six, I mean only six towns or districts were under state control.

But now the situation is different, now we have got greater presence is ten districts - and when I say districts I of course mean districts and villages. There is a freedom of movement between districts and between villages and most of the areas controlled by us, and not just ordinary people are able to travel from one district to another but also civil servants as well.

Mr Mangal added that it was not just security forces now operating in these areas but local governance was also functioning in these areas to provide all the necessary support and services that the public in Afghanistan should have. He also stressed that there had been real gains in law and order in the areas now under government control.

The insurgency in Helmand is strengthened and financed by the opium trade and Mr Mangal said when he took office two years ago narcotics was one of the main issues facing him but efforts in Helmand had managed to reduce cultivation of the crop by about half:

Everybody knows that between 2005 and 2008 the cultivation was going up and only in 2009 we managed to decrease the percentage of the cultivation of poppies by 33.7 percent. So the more we have security the more we have managed to reduce the cultivation of the crop.

The reduction in cultivation means more influence over security as well.

Mr Mangal said that there had also been great achievements in development as well and highlighted the Kajaki Dam project - which UK forces helped deliver in 2008 - and said that the power it was now delivering to the Kajaki area was making a real difference, doubling the power generation in the area.

Other examples of development highlighted by Mr Mangal included the new civilian airport in Lashkar Gah and improved irrigation.

In terms of education delivery he said that provision had increased in the order of three to four times than seen in the past. Specifically, he said that 18 months ago there were 54 schools in the province serving 56,000 students but this has now increased to 135 schools with 140,000 students and 25-28 percent of those students being female, adding that there were plans to increase education opportunities for girls at district level.

Summing up the achievements of the international effort in Afghanistan over the last two and a half years Mr Mangal said that when he first entered the governor’s building in 2008 insurgents were based just 2km away and artillery was often fired at his residence. He also said that fields of opium poppies could be seen from the roof - but now he has travelled 150km from his office and seen no poppy cultivation.

Clearly none of this progress would be achievable without the space provided by security forces - both ISAF and Afghan - and asked how long the province could be held by Afghan forces alone if ISAF forces were to withdraw tomorrow Mr Mangal gave the honest assessment that Afghan Forces are not yet ready to take complete control of security - but that progress towards this aim was being made:

We are in no doubt that we are not yet in a position to say that we will be able to have greater security without the presence of ISAF and NATO in the province,” Mr Mangal said.

But we are working very hard on the transition process and we are working very hard to train the Afghan security forces and train them accordingly so we are able to meet the deadline and take responsibility for security.

According to our one year plan we will be able to take responsibility for security for a few areas over the next year… although we will need to have time to take responsibility for the whole province.

Governor Mangal said he was confident the deadline for beginning to withdraw British combat troops by the summer of 2015 would be achieved as long as current training levels are maintained - but that this relied on the continuing commitment of the international community.

British troops have been at the forefront of the security effort in Helmand since 2006 and Mr Mangal said that the cost expended on the province had not been in vain, progress had been made and British troops were improving security not only in Afghanistan but as a result in the UK as well.

He also said that as a father himself he could understand the pain and suffering of the families of those who had lost loved ones in Helmand:

Of course the sacrifice that you have made here in Afghanistan we have gained a lot… but I need to remind you that security in Afghanistan also means security in the west and UK, so we have a shared common aim.

Afghan people will never be in a position to forget and Afghan history will always remember the people that have fought.

To mark his appreciation for the commitment of UK forces Mr Mangal said that he would be visiting the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire during his time in the UK and would be meeting the family of a fallen UK serviceman to speak to them personally.",Domestic Abuse Protection Orders (DAPOs),Legislative,Welfare,id25_733

They passed out at Cameron Barracks in Inverness on Saturday 7 August 2010 and the majority of them will go on to join the Territorial 6th and 7th battalions of The Royal Regiment of Scotland (6 SCOTS and 7 SCOTS).

These two battalions also received last week their own new feather hackles for their Tam o’ Shanters which identify them as individual battalions of the regiment.

In the past the Territorials wore the hackle of their nearest regular battalion.

6 SCOTS received grey hackles, while 7 SCOTS now sport purple hackles.

The hackles are the newest piece of uniform that The Royal Regiment of Scotland has been granted since it was formed in 2006.

The grey and purple hackles were unveiled at the regiment’s headquarters in Edinburgh Castle last Friday.

Hackles are a very important part of a unit’s identity. Some of them were granted as battle honours to soldiers in battle in their antecedent regiments’ history and they embody a soldier’s particular allegiance to a battalion.

Lieutenant General Andrew Graham, Colonel of the Regiment and its most senior member, said of the new headdress:

In all that we do we strive to carry forward the more than 2,500 cumulative years of proud and courageous fighting tradition and exemplary service of our antecedent regiments.

We are determined to act as a regiment of seven battalions and we will not treat our TA battalions, who are making such a strong contribution to the regiment, on and off operations, as ‘afterthoughts’.

The Territorial Army (TA) members of the regiment asked for their respective battalion identities to be marked by a unique hackle.

Lieutenant Colonel Charlie Platt, Commanding Officer of 6 SCOTS, said:

The introduction of a grey hackle is about reinforcing battalion identity and as such it is a very positive development for 6 SCOTS.

The colour is not important and deliberately bears no historical or antecedent significance; what is important is that the battalion now has its own colour that its members can be proud to wear.

The Commanding Officer of 7 SCOTS, Lieutenant Colonel Ed Chelsea, said:

The introduction and wearing of the purple hackle gives 7 SCOTS its own separate identity, recognising the battalion as an entity in its own right, rather than being made up of different parts.

Being the only TA infantry battalion in the Highlands of Scotland, and providing continual support to overseas operations, it is only fitting that we are so recognised. We will wear the new purple hackle with pride.",Increased arrests and disruption of heroin production by the Helmand CNPA,Legislative,Market-based,id25_734

The new Domestic Abuse Protection Notices and Orders will also be handed out by all courts (family, civil, and criminal), meaning more perpetrators will be forced to live under restrictions.

They will initially launch in Greater Manchester, three London boroughs and with the British Transport Police. They will also be used in Cleveland and North Wales from early 2025 ahead of a national rollout.

The Domestic Abuse Protection Notices can be issued by the police immediately following any incident of abuse, providing protection straight away and giving police time to apply for a Domestic Abuse Protection Order to secure longer term protection for the victim.

Unlike some existing protections, which can only be enforced for 28 days, the new Domestic Abuse Protection Orders will have no time restrictions, meaning victims are protected for as long as needed to stay safe. Breaching the order will be a criminal offence punishable by up to five years in prison, making sure perpetrators who flout the rules are punished.

Friends and family of victims will also be able to apply for the new orders on behalf of the victim, as well as victims themselves and the police. This will reduce victim engagement with the criminal justice system, if necessary – process which can be daunting for some survivors.

As well as imposing exclusion zones, the orders can mandate positive requirements such as attendance at a behaviour change programme.

For the first time, family courts able to impose tagging in the most serious cases, a power previously reserved for the police and criminal courts only.

Minister for Victims and Violence Against Women and Girls, Alex Davies-Jones, said:

It takes tremendous courage for victims of domestic abuse to seek help. Our role in government is to make this as straightforward as possible. These new orders reduce the pressure on victims by allowing third parties to make an application on their behalf, while ensuring the powers available to the courts are more stringent than ever before. This government will continue to do all it can to end violence against women and girls.

Minister for Safeguarding and Violence Against Women and Girls Jess Phillips said:

More than two million people are estimated to have experienced domestic abuse in the last year – a number that is appalling, frightening and we are determined to change.

That’s why one of our first acts to deliver against our ambitious manifesto pledge to halve violence against women and girls in a decade is to launch new, strengthened Domestic Abuse Protection Orders. By bringing together the strongest elements of existing orders into a flexible order that covers all forms of domestic abuse and has no time limit, we’ll ensure more victims receive the robust protection they deserve.

The Domestic Abuse Commissioner said:

Domestic Abuse Protection Orders were designed to bring together the most effective features of existing orders to provide flexible and long-term protection to victims of domestic abuse.

The DAPO pilot should evidence what is needed to sufficiently resource participating agencies and sector partners alike, so that it can be fully funded for a national rollout.

I look forward to closely following the pilot’s progress and see how DAPOs can improve the safety of domestic abuse victims and hold perpetrators to account across England and Wales.

Victims and VAWG Minister Alex Davies-Jones will visit Croydon Court and Minister for Victims and Safeguarding Jess Phillips will visit the Metropolitan Police today to mark the launch, as they raise awareness of the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Based Violence campaign.

He has been mentoring the Helmand division of the Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan (CNPA) based in the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah.

Between April 2009 and March 2010, the Helmand CNPA disrupted the production and distribution of heroin with a UK street value of £47m.

After Squadron Leader Daly helped to introduce new targeting strategies and intelligence development, this figure rose six-fold to £301m in the following year.

Over the same timeframes, intelligence-led operations also resulted in an increase in arrests, up from under 100 to nearly 160.

Despite the CNPA investigators facing an increased workload, the quality of their investigations also improved, achieving an impressive conviction rate of 94 per cent.

The CNPA is part of the Afghan National Police and the lead unit for countering narcotics in Helmand, where over half of Afghanistan’s opium is produced.

They target those who transport, refine and sell drugs (particularly opium and heroin) as well as those who smuggle the chemicals needed for the refining process.

From a counter-insurgency perspective, opium and its subsequent production into heroin is an essential source of funding.

Of those arrested by the CNPA for drug-related offences, nearly half were also charged with insurgent activity, whilst from a domestic perspective, over 90 per cent of the heroin found on UK streets originates in Afghanistan*.

Outlining his mission over the past 12 months, Squadron Leader Daly said:

My goal was to improve the capacity and operational capability of the CNPA, whilst complementing the counter-insurgency campaign. The huge leap forward taken over the past year reflects how the unit has enthusiastically embraced new ideas.

During my tour, I have been able to help them revamp their targeting strategy, delivered practical support to the unit’s intelligence-gathering team and provided specialist advice on collecting evidence.

On the role of the RAF Police in Afghanistan, he said:

As most RAF personnel in Afghanistan are based at either Kandahar or Camp Bastion, I suspect there is a certain degree of ignorance within the Service about the duties the RAF Police undertake in forward locations throughout Helmand.

RAF Police NCOs [non-commissioned officers] are often employed on counter-IED and Afghan National Police partnering teams on the front line and face the daily threat of insurgent attack.

From the comments I have received over the past 12 months from my Army colleagues, these NCOs have forged an excellent professional reputation for their policing and combat skills.

After his return to the UK, Squadron Leader Daly will take up his next post commanding the Special Investigations Branch, the RAF Police’s equivalent of the civilian CID, targeting criminal activity within the Services.

The transport aircraft left RAF Brize Norton on the morning of 21 January 2011 with 400 ShelterBoxes containing tents, food and supplies for those affected by the floods.

The plane landed at Cartagena Airport in the north of the country where the aid boxes were immediately packed onto trucks by the Colombian Army for delivery to the worst affected areas in the south.

The aircraft’s captain, Flight Lieutenant Ben Mountfield, said:

Alex Chalk KC confirmed 13,000 new and improved cameras are now available across public sector prisons, as he met staff at HMP Isis in London to mark his first week in post.

It doubles the total available to be used every time an officer is on duty, capturing challenging prisoner behaviour and how staff have dealt with it, helping to stop false accusations from prisoners.

It means staff can be more confident in the actions they take to de-escalate tricky situations and a pilot study published in 2020 found they can improve trust between staff and prisoners.

These new devices also offer superior image and audio quality, leading to improved evidence gathering which can speed up prison adjudication processes, support criminal prosecutions and potentially halt lengthy legal action – saving taxpayers’ money and courts’ time.

They also help reduce the need to pay unnecessary compensation to prisoners paid who have made up allegations.

For example, body-worn cameras recently proved their worth when a prisoner’s claim to have been assaulted while resisting a transfer to HMP Rochester was thrown out by police. Footage worn throughout the incident found prison staff used reasonable force.

Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary, Alex Chalk KC, said:

These new, improved video cameras are proving highly effective at preventing vexatious claims by prisoners, calming volatile situations, and keeping our dedicated prison officers and our prisons safe.

Other security measures including synthetic pepper spray, x-ray body scanners and airport style security are helping turn prisoners away from crime and towards purposeful activity.

The new cameras are the latest measure, building on our £100 million investment to improve safety in prisons and protect frontline staff, adding to the roll-out of PAVA spray and police-style restraints rolled out in men’s prisons in recent years.

It follows the government toughening prison sentences for assaults on emergency workers – including prison officers, by raising maximum sentences to 12 months in 2018 and again to up to 2 years, through last year’s Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act.

Jade Turner, Custodial Manager at HMP Styal said:

As prison officers, sometimes we have to deal with difficult situations and I have found body worn cameras help make my job safer, while reassuring prisoners we will work with them openly and transparently.

Our game-changing X-ray body scanners have thwarted almost more than 28,000 attempts to smuggle drugs, phones and weapons.

And in December we went further, striking theCrime in Prisons Referral Agreementwith Counter Terror Police and the Crown Prosecution Service to ensure more offences by prisoners are dealt with in the courts – toughening sentences for those guilty of crime behind bars.","Presence of UK and US military personnel in Afghanistan (specifically, 42 Commando RM, Estonian soldiers, and the visit by General Petraeus)",Institutional,Other,id25_738

Despite vastly differing languages and cultures, the Highlanders and the Afghans have built close relationships with each other and those they have been working to protect.

With temperatures regularly reaching above 40 degrees Celsius, it has not been uncommon for the soldiers to take a break from a patrol and accept the generosity of a local farmer offering them shade, chai (tea) and even watermelons.

These opportunities help to dispel many of the myths that exist about ISAF and Afghan forces and are a chance for the soldiers to gather information which may prove to be useful intelligence.

Highlander Hugh Mackay regularly carried out patrols in his Jackal vehicle:

Wherever we go, the locals always give us a wave when we drive past, and when we stop and chat they give us chai and melon. The people around here are very hospitable.

Back at base, the Highlanders and the Afghans eat together and spend their downtime learning about each other. Lance Corporal Donnie Macphee has been based alongside the Afghans at Checkpoint Khoorashan. He said:

Working and living in a partnered location brings a lot of issues, including cultural sensitivities. But we have constantly maintained a great working relationship with the AUP and they have been a pleasure to work with.

I completed a Pashto language course before I deployed and the Afghans have been happy to talk to me and help me improve my skills.

The extent of the cultural differences between the Highlanders and their Afghan partners was highlighted during the holy month of Ramadan. Throughout August, the AUP, who are devout Muslims, were unable to eat or drink between sunrise and sunset.

Sympathetic to their colleagues’ religion, 4 SCOTS hosted a number of ‘iftar’ meals (after sunset as a breaking of the fast) for the AUP, local elders and officials.

Corporal Andrew Reid said the locals have been really kind to them in return:

I was located in an isolated checkpoint with only seven other guys. The locals would come to the checkpoint and have a chat, they would bring homemade bread and melon. During our time we could see real progress, with a shop opening up nearby.

The good relationship between the British and Afghan forces has helped make doing the job of providing security much easier. When the Afghan Police and Army formally took over responsibility for security in the city of Lashkar Gah back in July 2011, the transition from ISAF to Afghan National Security Forces control was a smooth one.

Since the start of the transition process, 4 SCOTS have focused more on the areas surrounding the provincial capital.

In places such as Babaji, where B Company have been operating, there is greater security and stability than 12 months ago. In some areas, the Afghan Police have taken over sole control for the running of checkpoints - another example of the improvements in their abilities.

Highlander Bryan Feenan said working with the AUP has been a better experience than he was expecting:

We always have a good laugh with them. They are very keen to patrol and interact with the locals. They have come on in leaps and bounds in my time out here.

The Highlanders will shortly leave Helmand and hand over the baton of working with the Afghan Police to the soldiers of 20th Armoured Brigade.

As a lasting reminder of the relationship that’s been built over the last six months, the two commanding officers recently exchanged gifts.

In OMID HAFT, 42 Commando’s J and L Companies played a pivotal role in the operation to clear insurgents from the Loy Mandeh area of central Helmand during which two Royal Marines, Lieutenant Ollie Augustin and Marine Sam Alexander MC, lost their lives.

General Petraeus, accompanied by the Commander of Regional Command (South West), Major General John Toolan, the Commander of Task Force Helmand, Brigadier Ed Davis, and head of the Helmand Provincial Reconstruction Team, Michael O’Neill, spent time with the Commanding Officer of 42 Commando, Lieutenant Colonel Ewen Murchison RM, who briefed the visitors on the operation.

Lt Col Murchison said:

The visit by General Petraeus and General Toolan was extremely well-received at PB Wahid, where they were afforded the opportunity to meet elements of the NDA(N) Battle Group, namely the Royal Marines of 42 Commando and the Estonian soldiers of 12 Estonian Company - all of whom were intimately involved in the recent operation to isolate and secure Loy Mandeh Kalay from the insurgents as part of Operation OMID HAFT.

The visitors spoke to members of 42 Commando who were involved in OMID HAFT, both on the ground in the Loy Mandeh area and in support of the operation back in the headquarters at PB Shahzad.

General Petraeus also met with the Estonian 12 Company Commander, Major Martin Kukk, and the Estonian National Contingent Commander, Lt Col Anto Kergand, to thank them for their support to the ISAF mission.

Though the weather prevented the planned military band and flypast for the afternoon, those on parade were still moved to hear the applause that greeted them as they marched up Northallerton High Street and saluted RAF Leeming Station Commander, Group Captain Tony Innes, and Northallerton’s Deputy Mayor, Councillor Jack Dobson.

Gp Capt Innes said:

The Freedom of Northallerton parade is a fantastic opportunity for station personnel to further cement the outstanding relationship and support that we receive from the townspeople of Northallerton.

Despite the wind and rain, I was extremely proud of the airmen and airwomen on parade today, and I was humbled by the support that we received from the public who braved the extreme weather conditions to acknowledge the service, dedication and commitment of the personnel from Royal Air Force Leeming.

One of the RAF Leeming airmen on parade, Sergeant Matt Fearon, said:

It was a really special occasion for me and is, without a doubt, one of the highlights of my career. I was slightly taken aback by the support we received from the people of Northallerton, and even more so in the torrential downpour.

As we conducted ‘eyes left’ we were greeted with cheers and applause, which was really special. I have conducted numerous parades during my ten-year career but this was the first time I actually marched through a town, and that reason made it the best.",Deployment of HMS Gloucester and Lynx helicopter for conservation work,Administrative,Informational,id25_741
742,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-defence-infrastructure-organisation,News story,New Defence infrastructure organisation,"The creation of a new organisation to manage Defence property has been announced by Defence Secretary Dr Liam Fox today, Wednesday 16 February 2011.",Ministry of Defence and The Rt Hon Liam Fox,16 February 2011,"The Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO), subject to Trade Union consultation, will bring together all those working on estate and infrastructure activity across the Ministry of Defence. It will deliver better strategic management of the military estate as well as savings of £1.2bn over the first four years alone.

This is the first such change delivered by the Defence Reform Unit under Lord Levene, designed to radically overhaul the structure of the Department without reducing the effectiveness or reliability of the services delivered.

Dr Fox said:

Our Armed Forces and their families deserve the best possible facilities in which to live, work, and prepare for operations, within the current financial situation. A single infrastructure organisation will provide effective support to our military personnel and better strategic management of the Defence Estate.

It should also deliver significant savings in running costs, increase opportunities for estate rationalisation, and promote private sector growth - ultimately delivering better value for money to the taxpayer while giving the Armed Forces what they need.

The new organisation will be a ‘one-stop shop’, managing the majority of infrastructure services across Defence and delivering an essential part of the defence reform agenda. The DIO will take on the estate management responsibilities of its predecessor, Defence Estates, overseeing the physical maintenance of buildings and equipment, including support services such as cleaning and catering, as well as energy and water for the estate.

It will also take on the challenge of supporting military tasks on an overseas estate that spans Germany, Cyprus, the Falkland Islands, Gibraltar and operational theatres such as Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the management of infrastructure Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contracts.

From 1 April 2011, the DIO will bring together roughly 7,000 staff, the vast majority of whom are civilian, working on construction, maintenance and disposal of land and buildings across the Department. Most staff currently work for Defence Estates, the rest work in infrastructure within the three Services and other smaller organisations.

By making these changes, the Ministry of Defence expects there to be a reduction of about 2,500 posts by 2014, and to save some £1.2bn over the first four years through estate rationalisation and other efficiency measures.

DE’s Chief Executive, Andrew Manley, who is leading the team responsible for the programme to create the new organisation, said:

This new organisation is being designed to ensure we have an affordable and sustainable military estate that gives our Armed Forces the best possible facilities in which to live, work and train.

A single infrastructure organisation will provide better strategic management of the Defence Estate whilst also delivering significant savings in running costs and offering increased opportunities for estate rationalisation.

The DIO will take on the responsibilities of Defence Estates, which currently spends some £2bn each year, managing around 240,000 hectares of land and property on behalf of the MOD, making the Department one of the country’s largest landowners, responsible for an estate equivalent to one per cent of the country’s land mass.

The current military estate comprises three main areas: the Built Estate, which is made up of barracks, naval bases, depots and airfields; the Housing Estate, which requires management of over 48,000 Service families homes; and the Defence Training Estate, which comprises 16 major Armed Forces training areas and 104 other training areas and ranges in the UK alone.

The Strategic Defence and Security Review made a number of recommendations that require running costs savings across the Defence Estate of some £300m per year by 2014-15 through disposals and other efficiency measures.

In this context, ‘infrastructure’ describes the acquisition, development, management and disposal of all fixed, permanent buildings and structures, land, utilities and facilities management services, with the exception of IT infrastructure.

Defence infrastructure staff are already working on rationalising ‘soft’ facilities management (FM) contracts, for support services such as cleaning and catering. This is a first step towards the DIO taking responsibility for ‘Total FM’. Ultimately, single regional contracts will cover ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ FM, such as the physical maintenance of buildings and equipment, as well as providing energy and water to the estate.

The creation of a single Defence infrastructure organisation will be carried out in phases, although it will take a number of years to fully transform the business. Phase 1 involves merging all MOD infrastructure funding and posts into one organisation by 1 April 2011. Subsequent phases should start in the financial year 2011-12 to transform the organisation to its final structure.",Liaison with other government departments such as the Department of Transport.,"Other (strategic plans, consultations)",,id25_742

The ship deployed her Lynx helicopter to help their conservation work by taking aerial photographic surveys of eight glaciers which will allow the BAS to compare these with previous images and determine if the glaciers are retreating and at what rate.

In South Georgia this is particularly important for the millions of ground nesting birds as the glaciers are the only thing preventing rats from stealing their eggs and threatening their survival.

HMS Gloucester’s visit came at the height of the southern summer which meant that the sailors were also treated to visits from inquisitive fur seal pups and penguins on the island.

South Georgia Environment Officer Darren Christie said:

The photos were absolutely brilliant. I can’t emphasise enough how important this information is to the management of the island and it isn’t something we could have easily achieved without HMS Gloucester’s assistance.

The ship’s company also helped to bring stores and equipment to the island and moved the BAS around their different satellite stations.

Gloucester’s Commanding Officer, Commander David George, said:

To go to such a place is an immense privilege. For sailors, it is something unusual and of low-intensity but it reminds us that there are other things. Things that are worth striving or fighting for come in many shapes and sizes, and one of them is that this wonderful haven should be conserved, which, in this day and age, is being managed by people like the British Antarctic Survey and the South Georgia Government.

The Type 42 destroyers are equipped with the Sea Dart medium-range air defence missile system which, in its primary role, is designed to provide area air defence to a group of ships, although it is also effective against surface targets at sea. In addition to their role as an air defence platform the Type 42 destroyers operate independently, carrying out patrol and boarding operations.

The present HMS Gloucester was one of the last four of the class to be built. They have a lengthened hull design giving better seakeeping qualities and greater endurance.

The ship was built by Vosper Thornycroft at Woolston in Southampton and was launched on 2 November 1982 by Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Gloucester. The ship retains links with the Rifles regiment and the city of Gloucester. The ship’s crest features a horseshoe, part of the city’s Tudor Arms. The ships motto is ‘Prorsum’ which means ‘Onwards’.",Exercise Joint Warrior,Other,Informational,id25_743

The demand was urgent:

“The Duty Fleet Controller advises that HMS Endurance has a major flooding problem and is drifting without power off South America. Please could you come into the office?”

Within 24 hours, a team of 13 salvage experts were Falklands bound to save the stricken ice patrol ship.

Remarkable things like that happen to SALMO.

If a warship has been holed and needs towing to safety, or if a decommissioned nuclear powered Russian submarine needs transporting, that’s when SALMO are go.

If a military, or occasionally, a civilian helicopter ditches, the unit is called in. Nigel Hills, who joined the team in 2004 as a naval architect said:

This can include the recovery of human remains. This is the sad part of the job.

But when there are no fatalities, dealing with aircraft is an interesting challenge he added:

We are told what we need to recover. It may be a black box, but it could be a part of the aircraft which is armed.

Operations such as these require personnel with very special skills:

We tend to recruit welders, mechanics or electricians from industry, and then train them to dive,” said Nigel.

The 56-strong team is divided into units based in Greenock and Devonport, with an HQ in Foxhill, Bath. They form an eclectic mix of divers, mechanics, electricians, engineers, master mariners, naval architects, logisticians, supported by dedicated business, commercial and finance officers:

The initial call for assistance goes through to one of the senior officers in the team. They assess the situation, decide how to deal with it, then shape the team. If kit is needed, it is mobilised or we look at the possibility of hiring it locally,” said Nigel.

The team’s expertise may also be called on to prevent disaster. SALMO marine warranty surveyors are on hand when sections of new ships are moved to the assembly yard.

And they were involved in the transport of decommissioned Russian nuclear submarines (under the Arctic Military Environmental Cooperation) to their disposal ports.

Nigel was aboard the MV Transshelf in 2006 moving a November Class submarine. His colleague Emmanuel Ofosu-Apeasah trumped that with the move of two Victor Class subs in the Russian Far East.

Some of the more major incidents the team have been involved in include the 2002 grounding of HMS Nottingham near Lord Howe Island, 200 miles (322km) off the coast of Australia. The ship was severely damaged, with several compartments (including magazines) open to the sea. Divers assessed the damage.

The salvage and recovery effort required the installation of internal reinforcement, rigging the vessel for an open ocean tow, de-watering of flooded compartments, removal and safe disposal of Sea Dart missiles, and, ultimately, repatriation to the UK, which involved giving Nottingham a piggy back ride on a huge semi-submersible heavy lift ship. Nigel Hills project managed the repatriation phase.

And in 1995, SALMO was tasked to remove 2,000 tonnes of fuel oil from the wreck of HMS Royal Oak. The ship had been sunk in 1939 in Scapa Flow by a German U-boat.

The complex operation is ongoing, but has, so far, been a great engineering and environmental success. The team is involved in management of the wreck, and liaises very closely with other government departments such as the Department of Transport.

Team member Andy Liddell is now working on an operation to survey the wreck of the Darkdale, an RFA vessel that was torpedoed by a U-boat in 1944 off the island of St Helena, as its fuel oil is now threatening the environment.

In 2002, SALMO led the recovery of a Lynx helicopter from HMS Richmond, that crashed in the North Atlantic.

At a depth of 4,000m, it was the deepest ever recovery of a crashed aircraft and allowing the accident invesitgators to identify a potentially serious defect and fix the problem immediately throughout the rest of the Lynx helicopter fleet.

SALMO experts also retrieved the bodies of the aircrew from HMS Portland’s Lynx helicopter, which crashed in darkness, in 2004, while responding to a possible man overboard alert from HMS Montrose.

And, in 2009 they conducted a seabed search off Aberdeen for victims of the North Sea helicopter crash, and recovered them.

When HMS Endurance flooded and began to drift without power in the South Atlantic, the operation to recover her was another good example of a major SALMO mobilisation.

A team of 13, along with a naval team and engineers from the ship project team at Abbey Wood, flew to the Falkland Islands, from where a RAF Hercules immediately took them to Punta Arenas in southern Chile.

Back in the UK, colleagues liaised with the Navy and chartered tugs to tow Endurance from the middle of the Magellan Straits to a berth in Punta Arenas.

After inspecting the damage, a salvage plan was put into action and the ship was towed on to the Falklands.

There, she was prepared for recovery to the UK, aboard the MV Target.

As well as it being a relatively new experience for the three aircraft and ten pilots, there is also a support crew of 120 engineers and maintainers from 4 Regiment Army Air Corps onboard the Portsmouth-based aircraft carrier.

Working around the clock to ensure the safety of the aircraft, this will be the first time at sea for many of the soldiers.

The formidable firepower and target-tracking capabilities of the Apache have already been demonstrated to impressive effect on the battlefields of Afghanistan and while onboard HMS Ark Royal this Army Air Corps detachment will explore how these capabilities can be further extended by working from a seaborne platform.

Under Exercise Joint Warrior, which will take place off the west coast of Scotland, the pilots will initially spend time acclimatising to the unique difficulties which arise when operating at sea, performing deck-landings in a variety of conditions.

Once this process is complete, the Apaches will then take part in simulated small-scale warfare, attacking land targets in a series of assaults planned, launched and directed by HMS Ark Royal.

Commander ‘Rocky’ Salmon, Commander Air on HMS Ark Royal, said:

Being able to operate a diverse range of aircraft from the carrier underlines our flexibility in the joint Service environment and the Apache brings with it an awesome capability.

The focus of this period will be to ensure that we safely integrate 656 Squadron into HMS Ark Royal, provide their crews with deck experience, and develop tactical procedures for the future.",Evacuation of civilians by military assets,Administrative,,id25_745

The flight enabled the two senior officers to better understand the capabilities of each other’s aircraft, supporting the joint UK-French aim of closer co-operation. Both nations have agreed to make their armed forces more able to operate together, maximising the effect of each country’s military capabilities while also saving money.

During the 90-minute flight the pair of aircraft flew at low and medium-level in western Scotland to demonstrate their handling characteristics before splitting to show the officers the various systems on each type of aircraft.

On return to RAF Leuchars, Air Vice-Marshal Atha, who as Air Officer Commanding No 1 Group was responsible for Olympics air security, said:

The two aircraft operate seamlessly together; Rafale and Typhoon are a world-beating combination.

Asked to describe his experience, Lieutenant General Gelee, a former test pilot, said:

A fantastic day and a fantastic aircraft. My opinion is that with these aircraft our two air forces will be hard to beat.

Piloting the Lieutenant General was Air Commodore Gavin Parker, Air Officer Scotland and Station Commander of RAF Leuchars, who said:

Coalitions have always been very important to military air operations as demonstrated during the Libya campaign last year.

As part of the stand-up of 1 (Fighter) Squadron, which will include a French Air Force exchange pilot, we’re looking to cement those ties with the French Air Force and continue to develop the close working relationship we already have.

The French pilot in question is Captain Marc-Antoine Gerard, an experienced Rafale pilot who is relishing the opportunity to fly with the RAF:

For me, flying with the RAF will be very prestigious and I will also be honoured to wear RAF badges,” he said. “It’s going to be awesome.

Travelling in the opposite direction is Flight Lieutenant Matt Johnstone, a Typhoon pilot who recently left 11 (Fighter) Squadron at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire to spend two years flying the Rafale in the south of France:

I applied for Rafale for the experience” he said. “It’s a privileged place to be flying the Rafale but it will also be a challenge to fly a different aircraft in a different country. It will certainly broaden my horizons both as a fighter pilot and as an officer.

The exchange pilots will be fully integrated into their new squadrons and will deploy on operations.

The exercise, which started on 24 January 2011 and which is due to run until 13 February 2011, uses scenarios which are based on more than four years of operational experience gained by Joint Helicopter Force (Afghanistan) [JHF(A)].

Colonel Neil Sexton, the Assistant Director of Operations for the exercise, said:

It is all about training our people in the JHC for Afghanistan.

The exercise has a number of objectives with two central aims, firstly to support the 3 Commando exercise which is going on all over Salisbury Plain, but also to validate our own crews, both individual augmentees in headquarters and the ground crews, in the roles they will play in Afghanistan.

This meant troops engaging in joint planning using Sea King, Apache, Lynx, Merlin and Chinook helicopters, all working together in an integrated way as a Joint Helicopter Force.

There was even a role for the MG Midget of the helicopter world, the Gazelle.

A crucial asset that battle groups call on when in Helmand is ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance), and an important part of that is the use of UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) surveillance. However, as UAVs are not licenced to fly in UK airspace, that role is taken by the nimble Gazelle:

Flying it on gusty days like this,” said the pilot, “it is a bit like balancing a broom on the palm of your hand; it’s easy to do as long as you concentrate and don’t get distracted.

The exercises contain a huge element of what has come to be known as ‘Judgemental Training’, which means when an aircrew finds itself in a situation, be it offensive or defensive, the crew must decide whether it is safe, correct and prudent to engage with the enemy.

Essentially it is about making sure the crews understand what they can and can’t do under the rules of engagement.

To test them, a small group of determined men stay out all hours of the night in the field, in the biting cold, dressed in Afghan kit and clothing using insurgent weaponry and vehicles.

They set ambushes, lay IEDS and mingle in shuras. When the aircraft are deployed the crews are tested on how they respond to these threats. Do they engage? Are they allowed to? Are there civilians nearby? After the sortie is over the crews look at the gunship tapes and are debriefed about whether the correct courses of action were taken.

Two of the team playing the parts of Taliban are Lance Corporal Ryan Oates and Lance Corporal ‘Kenny’ Everett, both of 4 Regiment Army Air Corps. Both have deployed before, and value this type of training.

Lance Corporal Oates said:

We’ve run this a few times now. In the morning we get a brief and sort our kit out - we keep getting better and better with more sophisticated equipment and scenarios.

If the scenario is IED-laying we’ll get near a village, and where the locals have their water bowsers, maybe a kilometre down the track, we will dig in the IEDs. Then we will get a vehicle as a disguise, get the lid up as if we’ve broken down trying to fix it.

“When the attack helicopter is overhead we stop our suspicious activity and try melting away. Then we come back, we try provoking them, seeing if we can trick them into making the wrong call.”

It can be a frustrating task as carefully-planned insurgent activity is often quickly dealt with by the Apache aircrews. On one such occasion, having carefully set up an ambush near a patrol base with a machine gun on the back of a pick-up truck, with the intention of using simulated tracer rounds to push an incoming Sea King helicopter, escorted by an Apache into a danger area, the lads had to watch as the aircraft veered away because they had been spotted:

We then heard in our earpieces ‘right, lie down, the Apache has spotted you - you are now dead’. It shows how good the training is,” said Lance Corporal Everett.

We do mix it up a bit, we can ad lib. I think it’s fair to say that the aircrews are never going to be able to second guess what we are going to do,” said Lance Corporal Oates.

We might be laying an IED and once we’ve finished that if the aircraft is overhead we’ll jump in the pick-up and go up to the village, then the Apache has to make that judgement, can they engage the hostiles without collateral damage?

As well as training the JHF(A), which has its base at Camp Bastion, Exercise Pashtun Jaguar also trains the Joint Aviation Group, which is immersed in the US Marine Corps HQ that sits at Camp Leatherneck, adjacent to Bastion:

Because while we are in RC(SW) [Regional Command (South West)] Afghanistan, we work absolutely integrated with our allies in the US Marine Corps. So this exercise is all about that, correctly preparing our people so they are ready for Afghanistan,” said Colonel Sexton.

During the exercise JHC provides the battle group with ground cover when called in to support troops under attack, transports soldiers around the area of operations, performs casualty evacuation and resupplies the four patrol bases that make up the exercise.

Freight is often delivered as underslung loads to cut down on the time taken to unload. Of course the weather and altitude conditions of Helmand cannot be recreated on Salisbury Plain, but the effects that they have on the performance of the aircraft can be taken into account; so, for example, the weight of freight or personnel that the helicopters carry is reduced accordingly.

Over the course of the exercise, the aircraft will have flown for more than 1,000 hours. The crews will have fuelled themselves with 800 slices of bacon and 2,500 eggs every day, and to accommodate the effect of that, 40 portaloos have been brought in.",Enforcement of the arms embargo,Administrative,,id25_748
749,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cadet-scheme-helps-inner-city-school,News story,Cadet scheme helps inner city school,Pupils from a struggling inner city London school have been thrown a lifeline in the form of the creation of a new MOD-sponsored cadet unit. Report by Leigh Hamilton.,Ministry of Defence,15 October 2012,"As part of an overhaul of Islington Green School in North London, it was decided that a cadet unit might help the youngsters form plans for the future and therefore achieve their full potential.

Cadet units can provide challenging and enjoyable activities for young people, offer them the opportunity to learn new skills, engage youngsters in adventurous activities in disciplined and structured organisations, and help them gain vocational BTEC qualifications.

The transformation of what is now the City of London Academy Islington is being led by City of London Councillor Richard Regan. It was he who believed that a cadet unit was exactly the right way forward for the pupils of the school:

Getting kids together and giving them a structured existence to me is absolutely fundamental,” he said. “It’s my ambition to create a CCF [Combined Cadet Force] or cadet unit to bring these diverse kids together to get them to think ‘aspirationally’ and give them hope for the future.

Elsewhere in London, the Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) was looking around for somewhere to spend their available funding on creating a cadet unit and so the perfect pairing was created.

The HAC has two functions. The HAC regiment is an Army Reserves unit in the military chain of command. The other part of the HAC is a civilian body which has charitable status and this is the section that is sponsoring the cadet unit.

Major General (Retired) Simon Lalor, formerly Assistant Chief of Defence Staff (Reserves and Cadets), is a trustee of the HAC’s charitable body. He said:

Because we’re a third party sponsor, we won’t actually be involved in the running of the cadet unit. The regiment can however add value by offering equipment, or cadets could go and train with the HAC. What is so good about this is that this is a local regiment with a local CCF unit in an academy.

Partnering with the HAC promises to provide the aspiration and inclusion that Councillor Regan is searching for.

He said:

The HAC is the oldest regiment. They provide the Pikemen [infantry who carry spears] who escort the Lord Mayor’s carriage in the annual Lord Mayor’s Show. It’s also an active unit. They’ve got guys out in Afghanistan. It’s a very thriving organisation and they decided they wanted to do something in the community.

When I met Major General Simon Lalor he agreed that this is a heaven-sent opportunity, saying ‘we would like to start a cadet unit, you would like to start a cadet unit. You haven’t got any funding, we will fund it for you for up to 120 cadets’.

Major General Lalor concurred:

We had an extraordinary situation where we had the HAC as a potential sponsor with money available, and the City of London Academy with a cadet force aspiration without any money. Perfect timing.

From the HAC’s perspective it couldn’t be better. The HAC is the City of London’s regiment and the fact that the City of London has sponsored an academy in our area just ticks every box.

This new cadet unit has already proved to be a worthy concept as the MOD and the Department for Education announced in June that they would work together to create 100 new cadet units in state-funded secondary schools by 2015.

But for Islington, negotiations and preparations have been underway for the past year to create the new cadet unit, leading up to D-Day last month:

September 17 was our first parade night which is when it all started,” explained Councillor Regan. “It was literally the first night where we issued uniforms and that kind of thing.

But there’s lots more work to do and Councillor Regan has high expectations:

I want to get 120 pupils signed up by 2015, but we’re going for 40 to start with and I think we’ll get that. I hope by next year we’ll be able to double that.

I think that a cadet unit is the perfect way to give the kids pride, particularly those kids who want and need more discipline.

Major General Lalor explained that taking part in a cadet unit can have a hugely positive effect on a young person’s life:

I’ve been to a lot of cadet units and seen a lot of individual evidence that the cadet experience does give those who are less advantaged a sense of purpose and structure. It’s that Armed Forces’ positiveness and that ‘can do’ culture that the Armed Forces do so well.

The youngsters can now look forward to the cadet unit being a central part of the academy’s life and it will take a good four or five years for it to reach its optimum stage and I think it will create a lot of added value to the education.

You can almost guarantee that the Islington Academy will have a real sense of purpose and some of them really will thrive and will become highly motivated by the cadet experience. It’s rare that a cadet unit doesn’t deliver that.

The ability to search vast areas and provide real-time information to others has led to more efficient and effective application of other military capabilities such as remotely-piloted air vehicles, coalition helicopter-borne forces, light-armed reconnaissance vehicles and combat aircraft.

Its superb capabilities, with its ground-mapping radar and ability to detect personnel and vehicle movements from many miles away, have led to some ground forces describing it as a ‘go/no-go’ asset for their operations - meaning that without Sentinel they would not continue.

On 14 August 2012 Sentinel hit the milestone of 10,000 operational hours in support of British and coalition troops, with more than half of these hours clocked up since May 2011.

Wing Commander Al Marshall, Officer Commanding No 5 (Army Cooperation) Squadron, said:

The achievement of 10,000 flying hours since the recent introduction of the Sentinel capability highlights the significant commitment by, and excellent teamwork between, squadron personnel, industry and our other supporting organisations.

The rate of effort, particularly when Sentinel was simultaneously deployed to both Afghan and Libyan theatres, has been exceptional, and has delivered a superb contribution to Defence and reinforced the overall importance of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.

Shadow came into operational service in July 2009 and operated as a flight within No 5 (Army Cooperation) Squadron. Its impact and success was immediate and as more aircraft were delivered so the operational commitments grew.

To cope with the extra commitment the Shadow Flight became 14 Squadron on 14 October 2011 and a fifth aircraft was added in December 2011. Operations continue apace and on 19 July 2012 the squadron marked a significant achievement by flying its 10,000th operational hour.

Wing Commander Rich Moir, Officer Commanding 14 Squadron, said

Marking the 10,000th operational hour for the Shadow R1 is very important as it is a significant milestone, and stands as testament to the hard work, dedication and determination of all those associated with the success of this unique platform.

“Since it was first introduced into service it has had an outstanding serviceability rate and delivered consistently in the skies over Afghanistan. It is an achievement that all associated with the project should be very proud of.”

754,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/csa-safety-paramount-for-rn-nuclear-submarine-reactors,News story,CSA: Safety paramount for RN nuclear submarine reactors,"Through the Royal Navy’s nearly fifty years of operating nuclear submarines it has maintained an excellent nuclear safety record. 

Today, the…",Ministry of Defence,9 June 2011,"Through the Royal Navy’s nearly fifty years of operating nuclear submarines it has maintained an excellent nuclear safety record.

Today, the Royal Navy’s fleet of 11 nuclear-powered submarines play a vital role in our Nation’s defences. Four of these, the Vanguard Class, carry the UK’s nuclear weapon strategic deterrent. A further seven attack submarines fulfil a wide range of defence roles, including protection of the deterrent and UK forces, precision land attack utilising Tomahawk cruise missiles, anti-ship and submarine war-fighting, and special forces, intelligence and surveillance operations.

All 11 submarines are powered by a pressurised water reactor (PWR) designed to cope with a hostile underwater environment whilst minimising vulnerability to external factors including combat.

The Ministry of Defence has announced that the submarine to replace the Vanguard Class will be powered by a new nuclear power plant - PWR3. There has been speculation about the safety of the nuclear power plants in the current fleet of submarines suggesting that their design is similar to the design of the reactors at Fukushima and that the naval power plants at sea today do not have adequate safety systems; neither of these claims is true.

There are fundamental common requirements of all nuclear reactor plant designs, including the ability to maintain cooling whilst the reactor is operating and the ability to remove the heat that remains within the fuel for some time after the reactor is shut down.

Various designs of nuclear reactor plant operate across the world, with each design dealing with these fundamental safety requirements differently. The key here, however, is that our designs meet recognised and widely accepted safety requirements; we have a robust regulatory system in place to guarantee that this is demonstrably the case.

A PWR plant designed to power a submarine is very different in scale and design to the reactors at Fukushima. Whilst the precise details of what happened, and the lessons to be learnt, are still being captured, it appears clear that the resultant nuclear emergency was caused in part by the inability to circulate coolant through the shut-down reactors due to a loss of electrical power.

By contrast the nuclear power plants in all Royal Navy submarines are by design tolerant to a complete loss of power supplies as they switch to a passive cooling regime that utilises the surrounding sea to maintain cooling to the reactor core.

Nevertheless, the Royal Navy is never complacent about the safety of its vessels; a review of the evidence from Fukushima is being conducted within the defence programme in parallel with the UK civil programme.

It is a fundamental tenet of reactor plant design that safety does not rely on a single system; safety is based upon a suite of reliable, well-designed and expertly maintained safety systems and protocols with built-in redundancy.

This applies to the ability to cool the reactor both while operating or during shut down, and the ability to replace coolant if lost due to a leak. Moreover the Royal Navy does not simply claim their reactors are safe; safety is measured and compared continuously against internationally accepted and extremely stringent standards. All Royal Navy reactor plants meet these standards, and further improvements are continually sought.

There are few countries that have the capability to design, build and operate nuclear submarines. Producing a small, highly robust reactor plant contained within a submarine hull, withstanding a hostile ocean and wartime environment, and yet safe enough for the crew to live within feet of the reactor core, is a remarkable achievement.

The United Kingdom is at the forefront of this advanced technology. To protect these advantages the Royal Navy takes operational security very seriously and, understandably, does not publish any details of submarine reactor plant design or operation.

Information security, however, is never allowed to take precedence over the safety of our reactors, and detailed scrutiny of submarine nuclear safety is carried out by expert personnel from within the Ministry of Defence, the Health and Safety Executive’s Office for Nuclear Regulation, and by independent nuclear safety assessors.

In addition, the Defence Secretary takes advice on the safety of the defence nuclear programme from a committee of wholly independent and renowned experts from industry and academia. Commodore David Langbridge, Head of the Defence Nuclear Safety Regulator, has recently stated that ‘the standards set for the safety of nuclear reactors are extremely high, and are met by all the reactors used by the Royal Navy’.

The Ministry of Defence is now designing the PWR3 power plant for the successor to the Vanguard Class that will come into service in 2028 and remain operational until at least 2060. This offers the next opportunity for a significant step change in the design of the submarine PWR.

Support from the US has helped us to innovate design in PWR3 to the highest international technical and safety standards, whilst, in addition, training UK designers and engineers in US advances in reactor plant design. While the existing PWR design continues to meet all of the required safety standards PWR3 can now be designed to be even more efficient, easier to operate, better value for money, and to set new standards of safety.

Today’s Royal Navy nuclear submarines are safe, and will remain so for the future. The selection of PWR3 to power the Vanguard Class successor represents a significant advancement in the continuous development of this remarkable and vital technology.",Evacuation of British nationals and passengers from Benghazi by HMS Cumberland,Administrative,Other,id25_754

The plane flew a total of 50 operations, of which 37 were successful (bombs dropped). 35 operations are shown on the ‘bomb log’ under the cockpit of the ‘new’ DV385 in the form of a wartime photograph.

The bomb symbols include one with a ‘D’ for Operation Taxable, the ‘spoof’ D-Day chaff mission on 5/6 June 1944, and one with a swastika denoting a kill against a German fighter.

During its time the original Thumper Mk III dropped a total of 15 Tallboy bombs and also dropped five 12,000-pound (5,400kg) HC blast bombs. It was involved in many important missions, including the first Tallboy raid against the Saumur railway tunnel in the Loire valley on 8 June 1944 and many raids against ‘V’ weapon sites.

Between February and August 1944, the aircraft was mostly flown by then Flying Officer (later Flight Lieutenant) Bob Knights DSO DFC and his crew (they flew 28 ops in Thumper, of which 23 were successful).

On 7 August 1944, a skeleton crew of Flying Officer Bob Knights and his Flight Engineer, Flying Officer Twells, delivered the aircraft to Coningsby for modifications to be carried out.

Wing Commander John Bell DFC was the bomb-aimer on Flying Officer Knights’ crew with 619 Squadron and then with 617 Squadron and flew with Flying Officer Knights on the 29 missions he completed in Lancaster DV385.

There will be an official event on Thursday 27 September when John Bell will come and see the ‘new’ DV385 bearing the same colour scheme as the original.

Arriving at Malta’s Grand Harbour, passenger Phil Douglas was visibly relieved at being brought to safety.

He said:

Everyone looked after us absolutely superbly, the food was very, very good, better than we get in the desert, so we were very happy. It was a very tiring journey … but under the circumstances it was fantastic.

Throughout the voyage, the crew of HMS Cumberland provided food, water and medical attention for the men, women and children rescued from Benghazi.

Another passenger, Richard Weeks, told of his terrifying ordeal when, during the unrest in Libya, he was robbed at knifepoint before managing to escape:

We were faced with looters rushing into the property where we were holed up and there was nothing we could do,” he said. “It had been getting more risky for the ten days before and there was no prospect of it easing.

They were armed with knives and knew they could take what they wanted, so it was better to let them get on with it.

It was a very sad and terrifying situation. I’ve lived between Cardiff and Benghazi for 20 years and the hope is that the country can return to peace soon.

HMS Cumberland encountered heavy seas during the Mediterranean crossing which meant her arrival into Malta’s Grand Harbour was delayed.

Mr Weeks added:

The Royal Navy has really impressed me during this journey. Space and resources were obviously limited but people were kind and considerate and we were kept warm and fed.

Poor sea conditions during the crossing to Malta meant several passengers suffered from seasickness.

The ship’s Commanding Officer, Captain Steve Dainton, said:

The ship’s company have responded magnificently. Ten days ago we were off the coast of Somalia conducting counter-piracy operations.

I think it gives an indication of the flexibility and the versatility of a British warship and indeed of the ship’s company onboard.

The announcement follows the signing of a concordat between the MoD and the Bloodhound Project by Defence Minister Philip Dunne and Bloodhound Director Richard Noble, which outlines their commitment to work together to achieve common goals. This includes promoting Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in the UK and raising the profile of science and technology in Defence.

Bloodhound incorporates many advanced technologies with direct relevance to the Armed Forces, ranging from materials and structures through to control systems and data management. The revolutionary technology being built into Bloodhound today paves the way for the equipment that will be protecting our Armed Forces tomorrow.

A team of five REME Engineers will assist in the construction and maintenance of the car over the next two years and will be vital to the success of the project both in the UK and during the record attempts in South Africa in 2013 and 2014.

The REME Engineers will work alongside Royal Air Force pilot, Wing Commander Andy Green, who will drive the new car, powered by a Typhoon jet engine and a hybrid rocket, during the record attempts. He holds the current land speed record as the driver of Thrust SuperSonic Car.

Philip Dunne, Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology said:

I am delighted to sign this concordat with the Bloodhound Project today. Bloodhound is an inspirational project that will have a lasting legacy for the UK by inspiring future generations into careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths. These are essential skills to British industry, particularly within the Defence sector, and it is vital that we nurture them.

This is also a great opportunity for the Army’s mechanical engineers to share experience and develop their skills whilst working on this innovative technology here in the UK. That experience will feed directly back into the front line as they progress through their Army careers.

Today’s announcement builds on the Royal Air Force’s already considerable involvement with the project, through Wg Cdr Green and the retired Typhoon jet engine that will power Bloodhound.

Richard Noble, Project Director of the Bloodhound Project said:

Bloodhound is a cutting edge, high-technology project, operating on a global stage in front of a huge audience. We are delighted that the MoD and REME will be joining us and sharing in this unique adventure. Their young engineers have great skills and attitude and will make a tremendous contribution to the building and running of the car. In turn, they will be ‘hands on’ with an extraordinary mix of aerospace, Formula 1 and space technology, and experience the education programme which is at the heart of Bloodhound.

758,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/liam-fox-outlines-reform-of-the-ministry-of-defence,News story,Liam Fox outlines reform of the Ministry of Defence,Secretary of State for Defence Dr Liam Fox has this morning announced the strategy for reforming the Ministry of Defence which will include the setting up of the Defence Reform Unit that will lead in the reorganisation of the Ministry of Defence into three 'strategic pillars'.,Ministry of Defence and The Rt Hon Liam Fox,13 August 2010,"Speaking to an audience at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in Westminster, Dr Fox announced that he is launching a full review of how the Ministry of Defence is run and how the Armed Forces can be reformed to ‘produce more efficient provision of defence capability, and generation and sustainment of operations’.

In his speech Dr Fox began by describing the background to the changes, highlighting the fact that the country faces a legacy of debt - the interest on which for the next year alone will exceed the budget of the Ministry of Defence.

He said that it was a ‘disgrace’ that there had not been a Defence Review for 12 years, despite our Armed Forces being committed to conflicts in the Balkans, Sierra Leone, Iraq and Afghanistan and with enormous changes in the global security picture.

Dr Fox said the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) will not simply be a random selection of cuts but an objective process by which the shape of the Armed Forces required will be reached by the end of the decade. He said:

The National Security Council has agreed that the overarching strategic posture should be to address the most immediate threats to our national security while maintaining the ability to identify and deal with emerging ones before they become bigger threats to the UK.

This flexible, adaptable posture will maintain the ability to safeguard international peace and security, to deter and contain those who threaten the UK and its interests, and where necessary to intervene on multiple fronts.

It will also, crucially, keep our options open for a future in which we can expect our highest priorities to change over time.

He said we need to ‘invest in programmes that we will require to put our defence on a sound footing for the years ahead and divest ourselves of the capabilities which we are unlikely to need in a world where the moral climate demands precision weaponry and where the battlespace increasingly embraces the unmanned and cyber domains’, adding:

We are contrasting cost-savings and the capability implications with the risks that we face in the real global security environment.

This requires assessing any proposed change in a current programme or platform against a series of criteria, including:

First, the cost-saving in years zero to five, five to ten, and beyond ten.

Second, the capability implications - what capability will be lost as a result of this decision and what other assets do we possess that might give us the same or a similar capability?

Third, the operational implications - what operations that we currently carry out, or are likely to carry out, will we be unable to undertake as a result of this change?

Fourth, the ability to regenerate the capability, at what cost and in what timeframe.

And fifth, the risk in the real world that this capability currently protects us from or is likely to protect us from in the foreseeable future.

In alliance with the SDSR Dr Fox said that the Ministry of Defence itself was in need of reform and to this end he announced that a Defence Reform Unit would be established to carry out the required changes.

On this he said there are two broad principles that would be followed. The first is a structural reform which will see the Department reorganised into the three pillars of Policy and Strategy, the Armed Forces, and Procurement and Estates. The second is a cultural shift which will see a leaner and less centralised organisation combined with devolved processors which carry greater accountability and transparency.

He stressed that a logical management structure would be ‘foreign policy leading to a defence strategy, then portfolio management which identified capability gaps, followed by specific programme identification and finally physical procurement’.

The new three pillar structure is designed to make this easier and to stop the constant over-specification and then re-specification of programmes which has led to cost overruns and programme delays.

The work will be led by the Defence Reform Unit. Dr Fox described this as ‘a heavy-hitting steering group of internal and external experts [who] will guide the hard thinking and challenge preconceptions’.

Lord Levene will chair this group and will be supported from outside the MOD by Baroness Sheila Noakes, George Iacobescu, Dr David Allen, Björn Conway and Raymond McKeeve.

In turn, it will be supported by a civil service implementation team with a remit to complete their blueprint for reform by September 2011.

Dr Fox also announced that there will be a review of how the Armed Forces undertake the tasks of force generation and sustainability:

We need to challenge some of the fundamental assumptions which drive force generation, such as tour lengths and intervals, taking into account the varying pressures on our personnel resulting from widely varying missions to see if we can update our practices and produce greater efficiency while implementing the military covenant.

The Secretary of State said he will be asking the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton, and the new Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Peter Wall, to begin this review once the SDSR has been completed, with a view to completing their work by the spring of 2011.

Meanwhile, the Defence Reform Unit will work with the Chief of the Defence Staff and the Service Chiefs to find ways of giving greater devolution for the running of the Services themselves.

He said the Department must get away from the over-centralising tendency that has become the hallmark of the MOD in recent years and said they will also consider whether the current senior rank structure across the Services is appropriate for the post-SDSR world:

We cannot demand efficiency from the lower ranks while exempting those at the top,” Dr Fox said.

He concluded by saying that taken together the SDSR and these changes represent a radical agenda for change and show how the Government is committed to governing not in their own interest, but in the national interest.",Operational allowance in UK pounds,Welfare,,id25_758

Secretary of State for Defence, Dr Liam Fox, said:

We welcome the Tongan contribution to the ISAF military strength in Helmand. This deployment represents a significant contribution from a comparatively small country and further demonstrates the continued will of the international community to work towards a stable and secure Afghanistan.

Their contribution will make a difference to the commanders on the ground and we are committed to ensure they have all the support they need from us.

Following pre-deployment training with the RAF Regiment throughout November, the first contingent of 55 Tongan troops will be posted to Afghanistan in a force protection role, a function which they proved particularly adept at during operations in Iraq. Their deployment will provide new tactical options for commanders to make best use of the capabilities available to them.

They undertake this role using the British Army’s Mastiff armoured vehicle.

A member of the unit, Trooper Ashley Street from Plymouth, has been driving in Afghanistan since late September and explains some of the difficulties that he has encountered. He said:

It’s not like driving in Plymouth. There is no driving order here at all and no right of way; at roundabouts people go round right or left - it’s madness!

But, out of town, the traffic stops being the big issue. Trooper Street added:

The dust can be a real problem, sometimes you have to drop back because vision gets limited - sometimes down to a metre.

Outside town, the roads are packed earth or loose shingle but the Mastiff handles these well. It’s got very good grip and it’s not as sluggish as I thought it would be for such a large vehicle.

Away from the tracks the going is difficult with steep banks and obstacles, but Trooper Street says the skills for driving Mastiff are just the same techniques he employs when off-roading back in the UK.

Trooper Street is a Land Rover enthusiast and says that his passion for ‘green laning’ has definitely helped him adjust quickly to the conditions on tour.

The Mastiff has a three-man crew consisting of a driver, gunner and commander. The crew work as a close-knit team with communication being the key to success. The driver has blind spots which would make manoeuvring difficult if the commander and gunner weren’t there to assist.

The Tankies are used to driving-by-teamwork because, on the Challenger 2 tanks on which they are trained, the driver can see nothing except the 45-degree angle to his front. Trooper Street explained:

When reversing, the guy on top cover just directs you back. This takes significant skill and practice to achieve but also faith in each other’s abilities.

Trooper Street and his colleagues from the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment will cover most of Helmand in the weeks ahead and see a huge range of driving conditions. The challenge has just begun.

Despite the Mastiff having one more axle than the Land Rover Discovery sitting on his drive at home, Trooper Street says the two vehicles handle in a surprisingly similar way:

Without the add-on bar armour, Mastiff is only about a foot or two wider than my Land Rover. It also has the same feel - a bit wobbly but you know it won’t roll.",Exercise EAGLES FLIGHT 12,Other,Informational,id25_761

R&R [Rest & Recuperation], Playstations and internet are not part of their welfare package and it’s all too easy to overlook just how lucky British soldiers are.

The Afghans love four things outside of soldiering - volleyball, cricket, learning English and sleeping, and in that order. So we thought what better than a little competitive sport to help people get to know each other better and enjoy some valued time off.

The competition took place last Friday, a day of religious celebration for Afghans and time to devote to understanding more about the writings of the Quran, but also a day when regular patrolling does not happen and outside of prayer time is used for relaxing, washing clothes in the well and recuperating before another hard week of operations.

The centre court was a re-engineered helicopter landing site (HLS) that near perfectly matched the dimensions of an international standard volleyball court, with a net made from pickets and para-cord. The first challengers were a team from B Company, 4th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland (4 SCOTS), and bagpipes provided live musical accompaniment to the tournament.

With strong support for both teams at the side lines the ANA proved a force to be reckoned with and stamped their authority on the tournament with a dominating 25-18 win. The majority of rules were observed, but the tolay commander, Lieutenant Aziz Bakhshee, decided that he should lead from the front and serve for the whole game.

As the next challengers stepped onto the metal boards that form the HLS, the atmosphere was tense with anticipation. The Gurkhas are well known amongst the ANA, not only for their contribution to mentoring and security in previous tours of Afghanistan, but also for their professionalism on the volleyball court.

There was stiff competition from the outset and rising tempers, with every point being fiercely contested. The ANA made a strong comeback that saw the game hung at 24-24 with the serve held by the ANA.

As Lieutenant Bakhshee, still serving, smashed the ball deep in to the rear of the court, the Gurkhas were forced to return the ball on the back foot. A resounding ‘spike’ from the Afghan tolay marked the end of a well-fought tournament and crowned the ANA soldiers as winners.

Lieutenant Bakhshee said:

It was great to chat with some of the ISAF company’s soldiers and not talk about soldiering. My men love volleyball and hopefully the Scots will put up more of a challenge next time!

The training was about honing key skills required for the Airborne Task Force (ABTF), which sees the Brigade maintain a force ready to deploy anywhere in the world at short notice to do anything from disaster relief to war fighting.

On Wednesday 4 April, some 120 troops from Colchester-based A Company (A Coy), 3rd Battalion The Parachute Regiment (3 PARA), parachuted onto the Everleigh drop zone before being picked up by helicopters to “assault” South Cerney airfield.

Major Richard Todd, Officer Commanding A Coy 3 PARA, said:

This exercise has allowed us to work on a number of air insertion techniques, learning the skills and drills on the ground and then rehearsing it in the air.

These techniques are applicable to all operations we could be asked to do as the ABTF, from the benign situation of moving into a country to a hostile environment where we could have to seize an objective by parachute assault.

The parachute jump on Wednesday was an overhead assault, which sees troops carrying light equipment and weapons jumping from C130s flying at only 600ft (182m).

Captain Tom Walker explained:

This is the perfect way to get a company of paratroopers on the ground within a matter of minutes. If the situation demands it, the speed of the descent and the equipment we are carrying mean that we would be ready to start fighting as we hit the ground.

Lance Corporal Mark Murphie said:

This has been really good training, taking us back to basics on parachuting and working with helicopters. Doing a jump in a tactical style is what being a paratrooper is all about and it’s been a valuable and enjoyable experience.

Troops from 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland also took part in the exercise, which was key training for the unit as it prepares to take over as lead battlegroup for the ABTF.

Speaking ahead of the event, SSgt Betteridge said:

It’s great to be preparing lunch for Her Majesty The Queen. It’s a huge opportunity for the team and I’ll certainly be leaving the Army with a bang.

I’ve given over twenty years of service to Her Majesty, serving in Iraq, the Falklands, Northern Ireland and Bosnia; so it seems very fitting that the last meal I cook will be for her. It’s a real honour.

Alan has cooked for members of the Royal Family before, including Her Majesty, when he was a junior chef. He created the Maundy Thursday menu himself, and will prepare and serve it with a 34-strong team of Army and civilian chefs and waiters.

Lieutenant Colonel Colin Vaudin, Commanding Officer of 2 Signals, said his Regiment was invited to do the catering by the Lord Mayor of York, Councillor David Horton. He said:

This event provides a great opportunity for the Regiment to support the Civic community, and also recognises the fact we will be leaving for a tour of duty in Afghanistan this autumn.

Every soldier from the Regiment was keen to be involved with the lunch for Her Majesty, and there is definitely a buzz of excitement and nervousness in the air leading up to the event.

Corunna Company was the Armoured Infantry Company (with Warrior armoured vehicles) working as part of the King’s Royal Hussars Battle Group.

A total of 98 members of the company were welcomed home to Battlesbury Barracks in Warminster, Wiltshire, by several hundred waiting family members and friends and colleagues from 3 YORKS.

Major Ed Colver, Officer Commanding Corunna Company, addressed his personnel on the parade square:

It has been an extremely tough tour. Be assured that we will remember those who have fallen, but today this is about those who return.

All of you should be extremely proud of what you have achieved,” he added before exhorting the gathered relatives to look after his men and women when they got home.

During the tour the company lost six soldiers in an explosion. Sergeant Nigel Coupe, from 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment, and Corporal Jake Hartley, Private Anthony Frampton, Private Christopher Kershaw, Private Daniel Wade and Private Daniel Wilford, all from 3 YORKS, were killed when their Warrior armoured vehicle was struck by an improvised explosive device in the Lashkar Gah Durai region on Tuesday 6 March 2012.

Major Colver, who was reunited with his wife, Lisa, son, Hugo, and daughter, Philippa, said:

Obviously the whole company feel fantastic to be home and we’ve had a great welcome from everybody today.

The six heroes who we lost have been in our thoughts and prayers for the last six months. Our thoughts go out to their families and loved ones. It must be very difficult seeing us come home and their sons and dearest not. For us, this is a joyful occasion, but for them it is not.

The remaining troops will return over the next few weeks.

Lance Corporal Dan Wenlock, who was met by his wife, Sam, and their two-year-old daughter, Poppy, said:

I’m a Mastiff commander and we had a very busy tour alongside the Grenadier Guards. We did our job really well, which is all down to the hard work we’d put into training before we deployed.

I’m over the moon to be back to see the kids. They have changed so much in the six months I’ve been away and I’m really looking forward to having some quality time with them.

Sam Wenlock said:

The welfare team have really looked after us, with lots of events and outings put on for families.

G Squadron used the Mastiff, a heavily armoured 6x6-wheel-drive patrol vehicle, to bring firepower and armoured support wherever it was needed, including supporting the Grenadier Guards and 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment.

Known as the Mastiff Troop the soldiers were involved in fighting the insurgents, patrolling towns and villages, and providing protected mobility for the troops on the ground. Each Mastiff was crewed by three 1 RTR soldiers: a driver, commander and gunner.

Another father, Corporal Semi Navuku, who was returning from his third Op HERRICK tour, said:

Now I have children it was a very different experience to be on tour and apart from them. It was a busy tour but everyone did really well. It’s particularly good to have gone out as a troop of 18 and come back to our families with no-one wounded.

Kalivati was only five weeks old when I left and it’s amazing to see how he has grown. Heather’s sent me pictures which kept me up-to-date and it was lovely to see him smile when I cuddled him.

Corporal Navuku’s partner, Heather Wade, said:

It’s been a long time and hard to be on my own with the children to look after, but it’s fantastic to have Semi back.

Troop leader Captain Pete Eadon said:

Our role is to move troops and provide fire support, and the area we were operating in has borne the brunt of fighting this summer. The blokes were outstanding and worked well with the Grenadier Guards, with the firepower, manoeuvrability and protection of our Mastiffs proving decisive on many occasions.

It is great to be home to see our families. An operational tour is harder for the families left behind who do not know what we are doing and just have to get on with life.

It is six months of worry for them, when for soldiers it’s six months of doing the job that they have trained for.

A further 96 soldiers from the regiment’s D Squadron will remain in Afghanistan until the start of November.

Based in Camp Bastion, they are responsible for delivering the Reception, Staging and Onward Integration training that is mandatory for all soldiers entering Afghanistan. It is the final stage of a six-month-long training package to ensure that the soldiers have the most up-to-date tactics, techniques, procedures and intelligence at their disposal.

Exercise Civil Bridge 12, theMSSG’s annual overseas training exercise, has been the first opportunity to experiment with the concept of a Security Assistance Group.

It brought together the military components likely to form this proposed military organisation, building on the lessons learned from operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

During Exercise Civil Bridge 12, three teams of stabilisation specialists deployed to northern Kenya where the British Army Training Unit Kenya (BATUK) currently trains soldiers preparing to deploy on operations to Afghanistan.

Their mission was to understand the environment in which the BATUK operates and the impact of its activities on local communities.

Regular and reservist stabilisation specialists from theMSSGcombined forces with civil servants from the UK Government’s Stabilisation Unit, communications specialists from the Media Operations Group (Volunteers), Royal Engineers, and public health experts from the Army Medical Directorate.

The exercise was also supported by elements of the Defence Cultural Specialist Unit and 15 (UK) Psychological Operations Group.

Commander of the Military Stabilisation Support Group, Colonel Alan Richmond, said:

We’ve got a broad range of capabilities but we’re all coming together to experiment with how we would work together and inform the whole development of the Security Assistance Group.

It’s about getting out and doing that outreach and engaging in a different environment that you’re unused to with a cultural environment that is also unfamiliar.

This is absolutely bread and butter training for members of both the Military Stabilisation Support Group and all those entities that will form the Security Assistance Group, and it is something that you really cannot replicate on Salisbury Plain because you don’t have those cultural issues and you don’t have those linguistic issues either.

There is an awful lot to understand here, so I think this sort of exercise is absolutely crucial to what we the UK and the British Military wish to do in terms of upstream prevention overseas in the future.

Cherry Roberts was one of four civil servants from the Stabilisation Unit who were integrated with the military teams on Exercise Civil Bridge 12.

She said the exercise would add to their expertise:

It’s part of our core training. We want to focus more on upstream crisis response but we also need people who are ready to deploy should a crisis erupt.

I would normally be a civil servant wandering around Whitehall, but it’s really important for me to get out into the field and understand how the decisions we make impact on the ground.

Major Jem Blades, anMSSGreservist, was leading the team operating in the Nanyuki area. He said the combination of different skill sets available on the exercise worked very well:

It fell out quite nicely with the people that we had; for example we had a Member of Parliament with us and also a civilian who specialised in the politics side, so we sent those two off towards the politics side, and the other things fell out quite nicely along those lines too.

Although a decision on the final design and build will not be made until 2016, detailed work has to take place now to ensure that the Successor submarines will be the most technologically advanced, to protect our national security.

Contracts have been awarded to BAE Systems, Babcock and Rolls-Royce, sustaining or creating 1,900 jobs at sites across the UK. Engineers at the companies will work with the MOD on the design of the new submarines which will use a new nuclear propulsion system.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said:

This government is committed to maintaining a continuous submarine-based nuclear deterrent. The contracts announced today with BAE Systems, Babcock and Rolls-Royce symbolise an important step towards renewing our nation’s nuclear deterrent into the 2060s.

We have a world-class submarine-building industry in this country and this programme will help to sustain or create more than 1,900 jobs across the UK.

By making the core equipment programme fully funded and affordable, we are able to confirm additional equipment projects which help safeguard our national security.

The largest contract, worth £328m, has been awarded to BAE Systems Maritime - Submarines, which will work on the overall submarine design. Babcock has been awarded £15m and will focus on designing parts of the in-service support. More than £4m has been paid to Rolls-Royce, which will be responsible for the integration of the reactor design.

The First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, said:

The Royal Navy has been operating continuous at sea deterrent patrols for more than 40 years and the Successor submarines will allow us to do so well into the future with cutting edge equipment.

In May 2011, the MOD announced approval for the design phase, costing £3bn. The contracts announced today are part of that investment.

It will be the Dambusters’ second deployment to Afghanistan and they returned from their first tour last July. But, even though around 70 of the 100 personnel in the unit are veterans, everyone needs reminding of the dangers they may face, which is where the training comes in.

The war week is planned and facilitated by the Joint Force Air Component (JFAC) from Air Command and involves 617 Sqn’s aircrew and engineers being trained and tested in a series of realistic scenarios, including indirect fire attacks, first aid emergencies and engineering accidents amongst many others.

Although the training is targeted at 617 Sqn personnel, a number of other external agencies were also involved - such as communications specialists 591 Signals Unit, legal advisers, Trauma Risk Management personnel, and a Tactical Air Control Party - to replicate and reflect the collaborative nature of the operational environment.

Officer Commanding 617 Sqn, Wing Commander Keith Taylor, said:

War week is a fantastic training opportunity for us; the range of events planned by the JFAC team here are excellent. We deploy next month; we are up for it, we are trained for it, and we are very much looking forward to it.

In addition to the challenge of maintaining the regular flying programme during the week, RAF Lossiemouth also hosted two visits.

Air Officer Commanding Number 1 Group, Air Vice-Marshal Stuart Atha, met with 617 Sqn engineers and aircrew, and spoke with JFAC training personnel about the implementation of the war week programme. He said:

This is the best and most realistic training that we can give our personnel as they prepare to deploy. It is about aircrew and ground crew working together as a team to protect themselves against ever-present threats in theatre.

The reason why this training is so good is that it specifically reflects the realities - especially the potential threats - of the operational environment they are about to deploy into.

On the same day, two MPs from the Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme - a system designed to develop politicians’ understanding of UK military capability - visited to watch the training take place.

Both Adam Holloway and Robert Flello got involved in the training and assisted with the first aid response to a road traffic accident scenario.

It was staged at Imjin Barracks, Innsworth, in Gloucestershire, and attended by delegates from more than 80 companies, including a number of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) with an interest in subcontracting opportunities.

From 2013 the National Capital Works Framework will be used to deliver higher value construction projects, more complex projects and cross-region programmes up to a value of £50 million across the UK Defence estate.

A pool of up to five pre-approved suppliers will be awarded Framework places and then asked to submit competitive bids on a project-by-project basis. These arrangements will run for four years, with options to extend for up to a further three years. It is estimated that the total value of capital works delivered under this framework will be between £250 million and £400 million over the four year period.

Speakers at the event included: Brigadier John Wootton, Director of Land Forces Infrastructure; Gill Hodson, the NGEC senior projects manager; and Jon Wooden, the NGEC frameworks projects manager.

The event provided delegates with an overview of the MOD, current military operations, DIO activities, the NGEC programme, and the scope and procurement process for the National Capital Works Framework. It also enabled supply chain companies, including SMEs, to meet potential main contractors to discuss supply chain opportunities in a dedicated networking session.

Jon Wooden, the NGEC frameworks project manager, said:

We will need to work closely with industry to deliver the infrastructure our military personnel need to do their job.

The Strategic Defence and Security Review is driving changes to military basing, and the Capital Works Frameworks are likely to be instrumental in this. It was encouraging to see a healthy industry turnout, with businesses of all sizes networking on future commercial opportunities.

Brigadier John Wootton, the Director of Land Forces Infrastructure, said:

A modernised fit-for-purpose Defence estate and supporting services are fundamental to the training and preparation of our Armed Forces for operations and for success once deployed.

During the exercise, the men and women of 814 NAS worked alongside their NATO partners France, Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, Poland and Norway.

Operating from Sola air base at Stavanger in Norway, the Flying Tigers searched for the submarines actively, with sonar, and passively, by listening to the submarines’ movements.

The 814 NAS personnel operated as part of the ‘friendly forces’, working alongside various NATO maritime patrol aircraft, four surface ships, including HNoMS Fridtjof Nansen, and multiple rotary-winged assets, including Polish Mi-14 ‘Haze’ helicopters, to counter the threat posed by three submarines.

The mission was to assist in the protection of the ‘High Value Vessel’ (FGS Spessart) from an unseen enemy, who posed a very real threat lurking below the surface and ready to pounce at a moment’s notice. The quiet and elusive submarines are difficult opponents, and can prove a real challenge to detect, even with the Merlins’ advanced active sonar, passive sonics and radar.

The submarine commanders continually tested the flying crews’ war-fighting skills, but the Flying Tigers leapt to the challenge, successfully hunting and preying on the threat.

The exercise demonstrated what a highly-capable aircraft and formidable opponent the Merlin HM Mk1 can be when operated by well-trained Fleet Air Arm aviators.

Commander Chris Stock, Commanding Officer of 814 NAS, said:

Dynamic Mongoose was a fantastic opportunity to work alongside some of our NATO allies, and to put into practice our anti-submarine warfare tactics. It provided really valuable training, and the feedback from the submariners themselves illustrated how effective a well-operated Merlin can be.

I feel confident in the knowledge that the Flying Tigers of 814 NAS will be ready to fight and protect our nation’s interests against threats, whether from above or, as here, below the water.

Dynamic Mongoose was a major part of the build-up for Operation COUGAR, 814 NAS’s primary deployment later in the year.

The exercise also provided an excellent opportunity for the squadron to hone their anti-submarine warfare capabilities after a lengthy period involved in maritime security operations. 814 NAS has been supporting the international effort against illegal activities on the high seas including anti-piracy, people-trafficking, smuggling, drug-running and terrorism.

This is the first checkpoint to be handed over to Afghan security forces in Nad ‘Ali and is a key stage in the transition to complete Afghan security control.

The Vikings have been working in Nad ‘Ali since their recent deployment to Helmand in March. The district is the large agricultural heartland of central Helmand stretching between the urban centres of Gereshk and Lashkar Gah.

The early stages of transition in the district began last winter. Over the coming months further checkpoint handovers are expected as the Afghan forces take on more responsibility for security in the area.

Corporal David Cadman, reflecting on the progress made since his last deployment with the Vikings in 2007, said:

I was out here over five years ago and the difference in the professional capability of the Afghans is astronomical. As we patrolled from Silab for the last time we all looked back; I felt confident that we had made a positive step towards security transition.

The Vikings, with the help of the Royal Engineers, ensured that the patrol base was in good order before handing it over, refurbishing the showers and checking that the guard towers were in a good state.

Major Wolfe passed on his regards and his respects before the men of B (Suffolk) Company patrolled for one last time out of a base now operated entirely by Afghan security forces. Major Wolfe said:

Both the Afghans and British forces have worked hard to make Silab a place that can be defended and occupied without overstretching either the Afghan security forces or ISAF. Its location is a strategic position in the area that places any force in a strong position to deal with the insurgent threat.

Our high-quality poultry with its exceptional flavour is renowned around the world, as are the high standards of food safety and animal welfare demonstrated by farmers and producers across the UK.

The Japanese market will now be able to enjoy more of our unique produce, adding to an already varied collection of UK food, such as pork, beef and lamb, already available to its customers.

We are working hard to open new markets for our agri-food businesses, and this is a significant opportunity for the UK poultry sector.

The market opening follows a series of complex negotiations over the last four years between the UK and Japanese officials to agree specific animal health requirements. Benefits of this development will be felt across the supply chain throughout the UK and will open up new opportunities for British farmers.

Ranil Jayawardena, Minister for International Trade, said:

This is fantastic news for farmers and food producers across the whole of the United Kingdom who can now take advantage of this new market and export poultry meat to Japan – the world’s third largest economy - for the first time.

Today’s announcement builds on our trade deal with Japan which has helped to secure new wins for our brilliant food and drinks industry and boost trade between our two nations, which was worth over £24 billion in 2020 alone.

This is Global Britain at work, opening doors to new markets for our great British businesses, removing unnecessary barriers to trade and creating new opportunities across every part of the United Kingdom.

Dr Richard Irvine, UK Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer, said:

This represents a major achievement for the UK poultry meat industry, providing UK exporters with the opportunity to further tap into the overseas demand for their poultry meat.

This is another positive step towards strengthening the UK’s trade relationship with Japan, in addition to the existing agreements which enable export of pork, beef and lamb from the UK.

The International Meat Trade Association CEO Katie Doherty said:

We are delighted at the news of the UK gaining export market access for poultry meat to Japan. The announcement means that IMTA members and other UK exporters can take advantage of the tariff reductions granted by the UK-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement. The agreement reduces tariffs on frozen chicken cuts from an average of 10% to zero over a number of years. Without the market access Defra has negotiated, UK exporters would not have been able to benefit from these tariff reductions which the government worked to secure.

This could not have been achieved without the hard work of civil servants and government, in partnership with the UK poultry industry, so our sincere thanks goes to all those involved. We look forward to continuing to work on opening more new markets for UK exporters.

The British Poultry Council Chief Executive, Richard Griffiths said:

The British Poultry Council welcomes the exciting news of British export market access for poultry meat to Japan, the world’s third largest economy. Our industry has worked closely with Government to open doors and create new opportunities for British poultry meat businesses that produce safe, affordable and nutritious food to world-class standards. We look forward to carrying on pursuing new markets to continue putting UK poultry meat on every table around the world.

In October 2020, the UK and Japan signed the UK-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), and the agreement is now in force.

The agreement ensures UK businesses could benefit from tariff-free trade on 99% of UK goods exports to Japan after a number of years. Government analysis shows that a deal with Japan could deliver a £1.5 billion boost to the UK economy and increase UK workers’ wages by £800 million in the long run, compared with a situation where the UK does not have an agreement with Japan.

The “Open Doors” campaign is a new, compelling programme of trade promotion activity that will encourage UK businesses to open new doors to international opportunities as the UK charts its way as an independent trading nation.

The agreement of Animal Health Requirements (AHR) between Defra and the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (JMAFF) for export of both fresh and cooked poultry meat was concluded in May 2021. This led to the agreement of the export health certificate and final opening of the market in June 2021.

Discussions were led by Defra with support from the British Embassy Tokyo and working in close collaboration with the International Meat Trade Association (IMTA) and the British Poultry Council (BPC).",AMSCI funding competition,Welfare,Monetary,id25_774

In its response to John Shropshire’s Independent Review into Labour Shortages in the Food Supply Chain, the government will implement a series of new measures to support the industry. These include:

Recognising the need for farmers and growers to have time to invest in automation and move away from a reliance on migrant labour, the seasonal worker visa route has been extended for five years from 2025 to 2029 to address this immediate need. 43,000 visas will be available to the horticulture sector in 2025, with another 2,000 visas for poultry. Further detail of the number of visas available for 2026 to 2029 will be set out later this year.

The government has ramped up its support for the use of automation in the sector to reduce the reliance on migrant workers whilst introducing measures to promote British workers into agriculture.

This will start with immediate work to fully automate a group of major packhouses in 12 to 18 months, which will improve understanding of the government support needed to make fully automated packhouses universally viable. Information learned from this will help inform our planned £50 million package of packhouse automation funding, with further details to be announced later this year to cover 2024-25 and 2025-26.

The government will also work with technology companies to accelerate the development of robotic crop harvesters – aiming to bring prototypes on a par with human pickers in three to five years. This will help make the UK food supply chain the most cutting-edge in the world.

The announcement comes after the Prime Minister announced thelargest ever round of farming grantsat the NFU Conference earlier this year - with a total of £427 million on offer to farmers, doubling the investment in productivity schemes.

It comes ahead of the second annual Farm to Fork Summit, which will be hosted by the Prime Minister in Downing Street on 14 May, bringing together representatives across the UK food supply chain to drive forward work to ensure British farming has the support and backing it needs to thrive for generations to come.

Environment Secretary Steve Barclay said:

We have a world-class food and drink sector, and the measures announced today will strengthen this by boosting funding for the cutting-edge technology that will reduce reliance on migrant labour in the long term.

Businesses do best when they can plan effectively for the future, which is why we’ve extended the seasonal worker visa route until 2029 to give farmers and growers the certainty they need to thrive.

The government will also work to improve the attractiveness of the sector for domestic workers, delivering regional recruitment strategies to support jobseekers into roles in food and farming, and building greater collaboration between government, industry and education providers. This includes:",Strengthened data regime,Legislative,,id25_775

New common-sense-led UK version of the EU’s GDPR will reduce costs and burdens for British businesses and charities, remove barriers to international trade and cut the number of repetitive data collection pop-ups online

Strengthened data regime will save UK economy more than £4 billion over next 10 years and ensure that privacy and data protection are securely protected

New data laws to cut down pointless paperwork for businesses and reduce annoying cookie pops-up are being introduced by the government today in Parliament.

The Data Protection and Digital Information Bill was first introduced last Summer and paused in September 2022 so ministers could engage in a co-design process with business leaders and data experts – ensuring that the new regime built on the UK’s high standards for data protection and privacy, and seeks to ensure data adequacy while moving away from the ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach of European Union’s GDPR.

Data is fundamental to fuelling economic growth in all areas of society from unlocking medical breakthroughs to helping people travel, manage their finances and shop online. It is vital to the development and use of innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence.

Data-driven trade generated 85 per cent of the UK’s total service exports and contributed an estimated £259 billion for the economy in 2021.

The improved bill will:

Introduce a simple, clear and business-friendly framework that will not be difficult or costly to implement – taking the best elements of GDPR and providing businesses with more flexibility about how they comply with the new data laws

Ensure our new regime maintains data adequacy with the EU, and wider international confidence in the UK’s comprehensive data protection standards

Further reduce the amount of paperwork organisations need to complete to demonstrate compliance

Support even more international trade without creating extra costs for businesses if they’re already compliant with current data regulation

Provide organisations with greater confidence about when they can process personal data without consent

Increase public and business confidence in AI technologies by clarifying the circumstances when robust safeguards apply to automated decision-making

Today’s data reforms are expected tounlock £4.7 billion in savingsfor the UK economy over the next 10 years and maintain the UK’s internationally renowned data protection standards so businesses can continue to trade freely with global partners, including the EU.

Science, Innovation and Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan said:

“Co-designed with business from the start, this new Bill ensures that a vitally important data protection regime is tailored to the UK’s own needs and our customs.

“Our system will be easier to understand, easier to comply with, and take advantage of the many opportunities of post-Brexit Britain. No longer will our businesses and citizens have to tangle themselves around the barrier-based European GDPR.”

“Our new laws release British businesses from unnecessary red tape to unlock new discoveries, drive forward next generation technologies, create jobs and boost our economy.”

Alongside these new changes, the Bill will increase fines for nuisance calls and texts to be either up to four per cent of global turnover or £17.5 million, whichever is greater, and aims to reduce the number of consent pop-ups people see online, which allow websites to collect data about an individual’s visit.

The Bill will also establish a framework for the use of trusted and secure digital verification services, which allow people to prove their identity digitally if they choose to do so. The measures will allow customers to create certified digital identities that make it easier and quicker for people to prove things about themselves.

The Bill will strengthen the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) through the creation of a statutory board with a chair and chief executive, so it can remain a world-leading, independent data regulator and better support organisations to comply with data regulation.

Julian David, TechUK CEO, said:

“TechUK welcomes the new, targeted package of reforms to the UK’s data protection laws, which builds on ambitions to bring organisations clarity and flexibility when using personal data.”

“The changes announced today will give companies greater legal confidence to conduct research, deliver basic business services and develop new technologies such as AI, while retaining levels of data protection in line with the highest global standards, including data adequacy with the EU.”

Chris Combemale, Chair of the DPDI Business Advisory Group and CEO of the Data & Marketing Association (DMA UK), said:

“The DMA has collaborated with the government throughout the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill (DPDI)’s development to champion the best interests of both businesses and their customers. We are confident that the bill should act as a catalyst for innovation and growth, while maintaining robust privacy protections across the UK – an essential balance which will build consumer trust in the digital economy.”

John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner, said:

“I welcome the reintroduction of the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill and support its ambition to enable organisations to grow and innovate whilst maintaining high standards of data protection rights. Data protection law needs to give people confidence to share their information to use the products and services that power our economy and society.

“The Bill will ensure my office can continue to operate as a trusted, fair and independent regulator. We look forward to continuing to work constructively with the Government to monitor how these reforms are expressed in the Bill as it continues its journey through Parliament.”

FURTHER INFORMATION

Ministers have co-designed the Bill with key industry and privacy partners on amendments which will give organisations greater flexibility over how they can comply with the regime while maintaining high data protection standards.

Unleashing more scientific research

Current data laws are unclear on how scientists can process personal data for research purposes, which holds them back from completing vital research that can improve the lives of people across the country.

The Bill has updated the definition of scientific research to clarify that commercial organisations will benefit from the same freedoms as academics to carry out innovative scientific research, ​​such as making it easier to reuse data for research purposes. This will reduce paperwork and legal costs for researchers, and will encourage more scientific research in the commercial sector. The definition of scientific research in the new Bill is non-exhaustive, in that it remains any processing that ‘could reasonably be described as scientific’ and could include activities such as innovative research into technological development.

Reducing unnecessary paperwork even further

The existing European version of GDPR takes a highly prescriptive, top-down approach to data protection regulation which can limit organisations’ flexibility to manage risks and places disproportionate burdens on small businesses.

Ministers have improved the Bill to further cut down on the amount of paperwork organisations need to complete to show compliance. Now, only organisations whose processing activities are likely to pose high risks to individual’s rights and freedoms will need to keep processing records. This could include, for example, where organisations are processing large volumes of sensitive data about people’s health.

The new rules will give organisations more clarity about when they can process personal data without needing consent or weighing up their own interests in processing the data against an individual’s rights for certain public interest activities. This could include circumstances where there is a public interest in sharing personal data to prevent crime, safeguard national security or protect vulnerable individuals.

Increasing public and business confidence in AI technologies

Innovative technologies like AI and Quantum computing have the potential to create widespread benefits, such as improving the delivery of healthcare services and reducing the risk of fraud. These technologies often rely on automated decision making, where significant decisions are made about people with no human involvement, or profiling, where an automated process analyses or predicts aspects about a person, such as their abilities or behaviours.

The UK’s existing data protection laws are complex and lack clarity for solely automated decision-making and profiling which makes it difficult for organisations to responsibly use these types of technologies.

The Bill ensures organisations can use automated decision-making with more confidence, and that the right safeguards are in place for people about whom those decisions are taken. This means people will be made aware when such decisions are made and can challenge and seek human review when those decisions may be inaccurate or harmful.

New measures set out today clarify that profiling is subject to the same set of robust safeguards for automated decision making when a significant decision is taken about a person with no meaningful human involvement.

For instance, if a person is denied a job or a loan because an automated decision has been taken without meaningful human input, they can challenge that decision and request a human to review the outcome instead.

As a result of these reforms, businesses, AI developers and individuals will have greater clarity about when these important safeguards for solely automated decision-making must apply. These measures maintain the UK’s high data protection standards and help provide more transparency and accountability for decisions made by computer algorithms.

Supporting international data sharing

The UK is committed to maintaining high data protection standards and continuing the free flow of personal data between like-minded countries, which power services such as GPS navigation, smart home technology and content streaming services.

The updated Bill ensures businesses can continue to use their existing international data transfer mechanisms to share personal data overseas if they are already compliant with current UK data laws. This will ensure British businesses do not need to pay more costs or complete new checks to show they’re compliant with the updated rules.",Advice and information sheet for pilgrims,Informational,,id25_777

Leapskills workshops, developed by student accommodation provider Unite Students, will offer schools and colleges resources to teach Year 12 and 13 pupils about independent living, managing money and dealing with conflict.

Schools, colleges and sixth forms will be able to put on the optional Leapskills sessions from September, using specialist resources developed by Unite, which cover areas including:

The sessions act as an innovative digital interactive masterclass to enhance how schools and colleges teach young people about what to expect and how to prepare for the leap of living away from home for the first time.

Education Secretary Damian Hinds said:

For young people leaving school, starting the next chapter of their life should be a positive life-changing experience – but we know that many people struggle with the pressures of moving away from home and living independently for the first time.

A huge part of education is preparing young people for adult life and it is right that we teach them what to expect for life after school, whether that’s at university, work or an apprenticeship.

Whilst the majority of that focus is on the knowledge and skills needed to get qualifications, it is also important that we teach our young people the life skills they need like managing finances and understanding healthy relationships, as well as helping them to build character and resilience to be equipped to cope with the everyday challenges in life.

Unite Students offer schools and colleges free resources for teachers to deliver the Leapskills workshops, which use video content and a digital game to present a number of student life scenarios that simulate shared living, problem solving and conflict resolution.

Across the country, 1000 students have already benefited from the Leapskills workshops through a 18-month trial, with survey feedback showing 96% of students were engaged during the session and 91% of teachers would recommend it to a colleague.

Unite Students CEO Richard Smith said:

Every year we welcome over 50,000 students into their new home as they make the leap to university. For many this is one the most important and exciting moments in their lives but it’s also a time of uncertainty. We see first-hand the challenges they experience as they make this important transition.

We believe that resilience is vital in young people and that given the right opportunities and experiences, young people can build resilience. The better prepared young people are for the transition to university, the easier they will find managing the highs and the lows often involved in this leap.

That’s why we feel so strongly about creating the Leapskills programme and offering it for free to schools across the UK. Building resilience in our young people is crucial to their experience of university and their life beyond. We welcome the Secretary of State’s support for Leapskills and the part we are playing in providing all students with the opportunity to thrive.

Natalie Corriette, a teacher at St Bonaventure’s 6th Form in Forest Gate who took part in the workshop said:

We were keen to offer our Year 12 students this opportunity as students can sometimes feel anxious and unsure about what to expect when living away at university. These sessions afforded them the ability to reflect on university life and to consider how they can best prepare for university life in terms of establishing support networks and fostering social relationships and friendship groups.

Our survey indicated that students’ confidence levels in terms of their knowledge and understanding of university life more than doubled by the end of the session. I would recommend Leapskills to other schools as it really helped to empower the students and allay any concerns they might have about living away from home.

James Appiah, Year 12 student from St Bonaventure’s 6th Form, said:

Tim Breedon said:

“As banking reforms progress, it is vital for the UK economy that the flow of credit to businesses is maintained.

“Non-bank finance is likely to make an increasingly important contribution, so we need to develop alternatives that work for firms and help them deliver growth in the broader economy.”

The focus will be on debt and credit products, looking at a range of finance choices, old and new, from corporate bonds to ‘crowd-funding’.

They will work with businesses, lenders, investors and providers of alternative finance to examine structural and behavioural barriers to raising non-bank finance. It will set out what steps are needed to ensure businesses can access a wider range of alternative finance sources.

Read more about the BIS Finance Fitness campaign, helping businesses access the finance they need to grow.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said:

“Businesses across the UK are still in many cases unhappy with the way they have been treated by banks.

“We have secured a rise in new lending from the biggest banks this year and credit easing is designed to provide another immediate boost. But I want to see as much competition in the market as possible and for businesses to have access to a wide range of finance sources.

“There are exciting innovations emerging that provide alternatives to bank lending. Businesses are selling bonds directly to their customers, missing out the middle-men. And peer-to-peer lending has opened up opportunities for savers to invest directly in the fortunes of UK businesses. I want to investigate and dismantle any barriers to these and future innovations.”

See (Report 07/2015)[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/report-072015-accident-involving-a-train-driver-at-sutton-weaver].

The accident occurred at about 19:00 hrs on 23 September 2014 on the line from Crewe to Liverpool. The driver was slowing his train on the approach to a signal which was displaying a red aspect when he observed a damaged section of overhead line and stopped his train before reaching it. He reported the damage to the signaller before leaving the cab of his train. Shortly afterwards the driver came close to, or made contact with, part of the damaged overhead line that was hanging down but still energised. He received a severe electric shock and was seriously injured.

As a result of the accident the electrical supply system detected a fault and breakers feeding the overhead line opened automatically, turning off the power supply. The driver was then attended to by the train manager and a doctor who was travelling on the train before the emergency services arrived.

Our investigation will consider the sequence of events and factors that may have led to the accident. This will involve consideration of the actions of those involved, the relevant rules and procedures, the design and maintenance of the overhead line equipment, and the way in which the aftermath was managed.

Our investigation is independent of any investigations by the safety authority or the railway industry. We will publish our findings, including any recommendations to improve safety, at the conclusion of our investigation. This report will be available on our website.

TheMHRAauthorisation includes conditions that the AstraZeneca (Oxford) vaccine should be administered in 2 doses, with the second dose given between 4 and 12 weeks after the first. TheMHRAhas also clarified that for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the interval between doses must be at least 3 weeks. For both vaccines, data provided toMHRAdemonstrate that while efficacy is optimised when a second dose is administered, both offer considerable protection after a single dose, at least in the short term. For both vaccines the second dose completes the course and is likely to be important for longer term protection.

The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has subsequently recommended that as many people on theJCVIpriority list as possible should sequentially be offered a first vaccine dose as the initial priority. They have advised that the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine may be given between 3 to 12 weeks following the first dose, and that the second dose of the AstraZeneca (Oxford) vaccine may be given between 4 to 12 weeks following the first dose. The clinical risk priority order for deployment of the vaccines remains unchanged and applies to both vaccines. Both are very effective vaccines.

The 4 UK Chief Medical Officers agree with theJCVIthat at this stage of the pandemicprioritising the first doses of vaccine for as many people as possible on the priority listwill protect the greatest number of at risk people overall in the shortest possible time and will have the greatest impact on reducing mortality, severe disease and hospitalisations and in protecting the NHS and equivalent health services. Operationally this will mean that second doses of both vaccines will be administered towards the end of the recommended vaccine dosing schedule of 12 weeks. This will maximise the number of people getting vaccine and therefore receiving protection in the next 12 weeks.

Based onJCVI’s expert advice, it is our joint clinical advice that delivery plans should prioritise delivering first vaccine doses to as many people on theJCVIPhase 1 priority list in the shortest possible timeframe. This will allow the administration of second doses to be completed over the longer timeframes in line with conditions set out by the independent regulator, theMHRAand advice from theJCVI. This will maximise the impact of the vaccine programme in its primary aims of reducing mortality and hospitalisations and protecting the NHS and equivalent health services.

TheJCVIhas also amended its previous highly precautionary advice on COVID-19 vaccines and pregnancy or breastfeeding. Vaccination with either vaccine in pregnancy should be considered where the risk of exposure SARS-CoV2 infection is high and cannot be avoided, or where the woman has underlying conditions that place her at very high risk of serious complications of COVID-19, and the risks and benefits of vaccination should be discussed. Those who are trying to become pregnant do not need to avoid pregnancy after vaccination, and breastfeeding women may be offered vaccination with either vaccine following consideration of the woman’s clinical need for immunisation against COVID-19.

They held an introductory call to discuss it today.

The UK and Taiwan have a long-standing trade relationship with annual ministerial trade talks held since 1991.

At the lastTrade Talksheld in Taiwan in late 2022, the UK and Taiwan discussed barriers to trade in sectors like fintech, food and drink and pharma, aimed at helping more UK firms export and invest in Taiwan. This year’s Trade Talks will take place in London and aim to help more UK firms export and invest in Taiwan in areas of mutual interest.

Minister Huddleston also spoke to John Deng, Trade Representative / Minister without Portfolio, to endorse the start of official-level talks on an Enhanced Trade Partnership (ETP), which will be underpinned by non-legally binding Memoranda of Understanding in key areas such as two-way investment, digital trade, and energy & net-zero.

The ETP will build on our ongoing collaboration through annual Trade Talks to tackle barriers to trade and promote UK expertise, deepening our relationship to take advantage of increasing commercial opportunities. Both sides will begin engaging businesses on the ETP in due course.

Like the UK, Taiwan is a champion of free and fair trade underpinned by a rules-based global trading system. The UK is already a major partner in Taiwan’s green transition, with more than 40 British companies already having set up offices in Taiwan.

The British Office holds regular discussions with the Taiwanese authorities focusing on how to enhance trade and investment ties and tackle market access issues and those relating to the wider business environment.",Legislative,Legislative,,id25_784

The signing of the Detailed Design and Long Leads (D2L2) Phase with BAE Systems (BAES), Rolls-Royce and Babcock represents a significant milestone for both the UK and the trilateral AUKUS programme as a whole, in the lead up to build the future class of nuclear-powered attack submarines, known as SSN-AUKUS.

The contracts totalling £4 billion will progress the programme through the design, prototyping and purchase of main long lead components for the first UK submarines, allowing construction to commence in the coming years and ensure the stability and resilience of our domestic supply chain.

Building on more than 60 years of British expertise in designing, building and operating nuclear-powered submarines, the D2L2 contracts will support thousands of highly skilled jobs in the UK – a clear demonstration of how the AUKUS programme supports the Prime Minister’s priority to grow the economy.

Alongside the design development and long-lead procurement, infrastructure at the submarine shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness and the nuclear reactor manufacturing site in Raynesway, Derby will be developed and expanded where needed to meet the requirement of the future submarine build programme.

The aim is to deliver the first UK submarines into service in the late 2030s to replace the current Astute-Class vessels, and the first Australian submarines will follow in the early 2040s. They will be the largest, most advanced and most powerful attack submarines ever operated by the Royal Navy, combining world-leading sensors, design and weaponry in one vessel.

Construction of the UK’s submarines will take place principally in Barrow-in-Furness, while Australia will work over the next decade to build up its submarine industrial base, and will build its submarines in Australia with Rolls-Royce supplying the nuclear reactors for all UK and Australian submarines.","Increased civil penalties for non-compliant employers and new measures in the Immigration Bill to prosecute employers using illegal labour, increase the maximum prison sentence, and close down businesses.",Monetary,Legislative,id25_785

The Secretary of State is in Auckland to put pen to paper on this mega deal, alongside New Zealand Trade Minister Damien O’Connor, Canadian Trade Minister Mary Ng, Japanese Minister for Economic Revitalisation Goto Shigeyuki and Australian Deputy Trade Minister Tim Ayres.

The signature is the formal confirmation of agreement for the UK to join the group, following substantial conclusion of negotiations earlier this year. The Government will now seek to ratify the agreement, which will include parliamentary scrutiny, whilst other CPTPP countries complete their own legislative processes.

The signing comes as a new government report reveals one in every 100 UK workers was employed by a business headquartered in a CPTPP member nation in 2019, equating to over 400,000 jobs across the country.

Membership of the trade group is expected to spark further investment in the UK by CPTPP countries, already worth £182 billion in 2021, by guaranteeing protections for investors.

Ian Stuart, CEO at HSBC UK, said:

The UK’s formal accession to CPTPP marks a significant milestone for UK trade, enabling ambitious British businesses to connect with the world’s most exciting growth markets for start-ups, innovation and technology. At HSBC UK, we are incredibly excited about the opportunities this agreement presents; as the world’s leading global trade bank we will support UK businesses to achieve their full potential and open up a world of opportunity.

Cath White, Head of International at Belvoir Farm said:

The UK’s accession to CPTPP will mean more than 99% of UK goods exported to CPTPP member countries will be eligible for zero tariffs. It will also ease administrative and commercial trade barriers to allow talented and passionate UK producers to tell their story on a worldwide scale. At Belvoir Farm, we export 20% of our turnover to markets across the globe, with one third of exports bound for Indo-Pacific markets, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Singapore. This is a fantastic opportunity to grow British brands, especially this year when the spotlight is on the UK.

Ian Galbraith, Group Strategy Director at Mott MacDonald, said:

Mott MacDonald is strongly supportive of UK accession to CPTPP and proud to have been part of the technical board advising the British negotiating team. The Partnership’s ambitious services and procurement chapters pave the way for greater recognition of professional competence in engineering and architecture, and establish open, fair and transparent competition rules in government procurement, allowing world-leading firms like Mott MacDonald to win and service new contracts across the many countries covered by CPTPP.

Speaking ahead of the signing, Kemi Badenoch said:

I’m delighted to be here in New Zealand to sign a deal that will be a big boost for British businesses and deliver billions of pounds in additional trade, as well as open up huge opportunities and unparalleled access to a market of over 500 million people.

We are using our status as an independent trading nation to join an exciting, growing, forward-looking trade bloc, which will help grow the UK economy and build on the hundreds of thousands of jobs CPTPP-owned businesses already support up and down the country.

The report found CPTPP investment accounted for:

The report also found that CPTPP companies punch above their weight economically. While they account for 0.3% of all businesses in the UK, they generate 6.1% of the UK’s total turnover - 20 times higher than the proportion of businesses they represent.

The UK will be the first European member and first new member since CPTPP was created, which would have been impossible had we remained in the EU. With the UK as a member, CPTPP will have a combined GDP of £12 trillion and account for 15% of global GDP.

The Government will now take the steps needed to bring the agreement into force, expected to be next year.

Being part of CPTPP will mean that more than 99 per cent of current UK goods exports to CPTPP countries will be eligible for zero tariffs. Dairy farmers, for example, will benefit from reduced tariffs on cheese and butter exports to Canada, Chile, Japan and Mexico. This builds on the £23.9 million worth of dairy products we exported to these countries in 2022.

The agreement is a gateway to the wider Indo-Pacific which is set to account for the majority of global growth and around half of the world’s middle-class consumers in the decades to come, bringing new opportunities for British businesses and supporting jobs.

‘Operation Magnify’ will involve Home Office enforcement officers carrying out operations specifically to target those businesses in the sector which are employing and exploiting illegal migrant workers.

The Immigration Minister hosted a meeting with construction industry leaders about plans to end illegal working in the sector.

Mr Brokenshire said:

Coming together with key employers and influencers in the construction industry is a chance for us to engage with those who are keen to maintain the integrity of the sector.

Illegal working undermines legitimate employers, harms the reputation of the industry, drives down wages and denies employment to hard-working UK citizens and people who are working in the UK legally.

Employers within the construction industry have a critical role to play in helping to combat this by ensuring they carry out thestraightforward ‘Right to Work’ checkson potential employees that prevent illegal working in the UK.

The roundtable event was an opportunity for those in the construction industry to share their experiences of illegal working in the sector, find out more about measures introduced by the government to tackle the problem, and discuss what more can be done.

Those attending included representatives from construction companies working across the public and commercial sectors and industry bodies including the Construction Industry Council, the Chartered Institute of Building and Build UK.

Campaign launch

Gillian Econopouly, Head of Policy and Research, was present from the Construction Industry Training Board. Gillian noted the negative implications illegal working can have on health and safety measures. She said:

Workers without the correct health and safety qualifications pose a serious safety issue to those on site, and the general public. We have found cases where illegal workers have used fake health and safety documents to get onsite, and we are working with government to stamp this out in the construction sector.

We look forward to the roundtable where we can discuss these issues further and work together to help ensure all workers on site are both legal and qualified to work here.

The nature of construction work means that the industry can be particularly exposed to the risk of illegal employment, due to historical skill shortages, reliance on transient labour and forged identity documents being used to gain access to work.

The government has already taken action to make ‘Right to Work’ checks much easier for legitimate employers to carry out, including by reducing the frequency of checks and the range of documents needed.

Failure to comply has serious financial repercussions – in the last Parliament the government doubled the maximum civil penalty for non-compliant employers to £20,000 for each illegal worker employed.

New measures included in the Immigration Bill currently progressing through Parliament will make it easier to prosecute employers using illegal labour, increase the maximum prison sentence for doing so to five year and also close down businesses which continue to flout the rules.

Those who work illegally will themselves be committing a criminal offence and face the prospect of having their earnings seized, and we will also continue to seek to remove from the UK anyone who does not have the right to be here.

The new regulations will prevent the burning of any specified vegetation on areas of deep peat (over 40cm depth) on a Site of Special Scientific Interest that is also a Special Area of Conservation or a Special Protection Area unless a licence has been granted or the land is steep or rocky.

‘Rotational’ burning is used as a management tool on moorland and blanket bog. Land managers use controlled burning on patches of heather during winter months typically on a 8-12 year rotation.

There is a consensus that burning of vegetation on blanket bog is damaging to peatland formation and habitat condition. It makes it more difficult or impossible to restore these habitats to their natural state and to restore their hydrology.

Restoring England’s peatlands is a priority for the government. It will help achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 as well as protecting our valuable habitats, and the biodiversity those habitats support.

Blanket bog, a type of peatland, is a delicate habitat of international importance, with the UK having 13% of the world’s blanket bog.

The government recognises that if moorland is unmanaged, there is a risk of wildfire which is most damaging of all and that these risks have grown due to climate change. Therefore, the government intends to work with land owners and managers to develop local wildfire control plans.

There will be specific circumstances where the ban does not apply, such as on steep land or where scree makes up half the land area. In addition, the Secretary of State may also issue licences for the burning of heather on blanket bog for the purposes of wildfire prevention, for a conservation purpose or where land is inaccessible to cutting or mowing machinery. These licences may cover several years so that they can be aligned with coherent management plans for sites.

Environment Secretary George Eustice said:

Our peatlands have great potential as a natural store of carbon, as well as protecting habitats, providing a haven for rare wildlife and being a natural provider of water regulation.

We want to work with land owners to restore the natural hydrology of many of these sites through our new agricultural policy to support our ambitions for the environment. The burning of heather on these sites makes it more difficult to restore their natural hydrology which is why we are taking this step today.

Natural England Chair Tony Juniper said:

This is a hugely welcome announcement which will see better protections for our globally important peatlands. Blanket bog is an amazing habitat that provides essential environmental benefits, including carbon storage, a home for wonderful wildlife, clean drinking water and flood mitigation. This is why it is vital we ensure these systems are healthy with peat-forming species, such as Sphagnum mosses, thriving in water-logged conditions.

We will continue to work with Defra and land managers to help with the successful implementation of these measures, including by providing advice on good upland management and leading a new peatland restoration grant scheme as part of the Nature for Climate programme.

This will provide funds to carry out restoration work on these precious ecosystems, ensuring their recovery and protection for the benefit of both present and future generations.

Today’s move marks a key step for meeting the Government’s nature and climate change mitigation and adaptation targets, and part of  the Government’s25 Year Environment Plancommitment to bring 75% of SSSIs into favourable condition.

The Government will be setting out further measures to protect England’s peatlands this year as part of a package of measures to protect England’s landscapes and nature-based solutions. The government’s £640m Nature for Climate Fund also includes funding to kick-start a programme of peatland restoration over the next 5 years.

This is a key agreement which brings G7 countries together to address the most pressing international and interlinked challenges of biodiversity loss and climate change. Leaders have also agreed to review progress against the Nature Compact to ensure delivery of its 2030 vision.

This next milestone marks a crucial commitment to supporting global consensus and taking bold action for the delivery of ambitious outcomes for nature in 2021. Climate change is one key driver of biodiversity loss, and protecting, conserving and restoring biodiversity is crucial to addressing climate change.

The Prime Minister has alsolaunched the UK’s Blue Planet Fund. The £500 million fund will support countries to tackle unsustainable fishing, protect and restore coastal ecosystems like mangroves and coral reefs, and reduce marine pollution.

Environment Secretary George Eustice said:

For the first time, the G7 has committed to halting and reversing the loss of biodiversity in the next decade.

This is a major step forward on the path to CBD COP15 and COP26 and is a sign of the dedication to accelerate action within the G7 - and beyond - to tackle the interdependent crises of climate change and biodiversity loss.

We have seen major progress this weekend and we welcome the collaboration between global leaders to raise our ambition and remain accountable in this critical decade.

The Compact’s commitments will be embedded in national plans as appropriate, raising ambition wherever possible, and the G7 will hold themselves to account for delivering effective action integrated with that to support climate change mitigation and adaptation.

Through existing G7 mechanisms, including at the G7 Leaders’ Summit in five years, the G7 countries will review options to ratchet up action and ambition, as needed, to ensure delivery of the vision for 2030.

With the help of volunteers from the local communities BATUK shares its land with, a total of 3900 tree saplings were planted and over 10,000 ‘seedballs’ were scattered.

The seedballs were created by coating seeds within a protective ball made primarily of charcoal dust, which protects them from damage and animals when germinating. By scattering seeds using this method, it can take as little as a month for new plants to be established in previously barren areas.

DIO personnel worked with landowners to develop an understanding of which species of trees would be the best for the local region, as well as the ideal locations to plant them within each training area.

The DIO team also attended a number of schools and colleges to encourage staff and children to take part in the “Adopt a Tree” programme. It is hoped that these visits will help ensure the survivability of the trees once planted, by inspiring the younger generation to build on the Environmental Week’s success.

The project was jointly developed by WO2 Phillip Kent, a DIO Training Safety Marshall and reservist serving in 8 RIFLES, and Melita Loigisa, Senior Range Warden in the DIO team’s Kenyan Support Staff.

WO2 Kent said:

“Restoring trees to the Kenyan landscape is vital in counteracting the devastating decline in the number and diversity of trees due to land degradation and biological invasion by non-native plants. By working closely with local communities, we can help to ensure the long-term sustainable development of our training estate in Kenya.”

Melita Loigisa said:

“I’ve seen a dramatic decline in the wooded areas of Laikipia County and the Archers Post region over the last 20 years. The DIO team has given me the platform as the Senior Range Warden to assist in restoring these important natural habitats.

“The ‘Adopt a tree’ initiative is something I am particularly passionate about, as it’s vital for the younger generation to understand the importance of our environment and the impact we have on it. Although this project is a small step, if its success is sustained it will improve the environment for all communities in the region.”

A variety of trees were planted, including some species which could only be planted in certain areas. The sapling species used throughout the project were: Yellow Fever Tree, Umbrella Thorn, Juniperous Africana, Wait a Bit Tree, Balanites Aegyptiaca, Olea Africana and Neem.

Land degradation in Kenya is a serious problem caused by overgrazing, unsustainable exploitation of natural resources and the adverse effects of climate change.

DIO’s Kenya team has continued to increase its environmental and sustainability performance in recent years. In addition to planting native trees and aloes across the BATUK training areas, enhancements have been targeted in recycling and waste management.

DIO and BATUK continue to work with and support the local community with initiatives such as rainwater harvesting and borehole solar conversions. While BATUK already uses solar thermal energy across its estate, an assessment study to see how renewable energy technology such as solar photovoltaic panels can be used to reduce BATUK’s carbon footprint will take place in 2023.

Brigadier Jonathan Bartholomew OBE, DIO Head Overseas and Training Region said:

“Ensuring that military training takes full account of the environmental sensitivity of each training area is vital in order for training to be sustainable across the Laikipia and Samburu counties.

“My team continues to build a strong working relationship with the community, and has benefited from the technical support of environmental specialists from organisations such as the National Museum of Kenya, the University of Nairobi and Mpala Research Centre over the past decade.

The process will be automated by the Home Office and reflected in the person’s digital status. They will be notified of the extension directly. This will ensure that nobody loses their immigration status if they do not apply to switch from pre-settled to settled status.

The Home Office also intends to take steps to automatically convert as many eligible pre-settled status holders as possible to settled status once they are eligible for it, without them needing to make an application. During 2024, automated checks of pre-settled status will establish their ongoing continuous residence in the UK. Safeguards will be in place to ensure that settled status is not wrongly granted.

More than 2 years on from the EUSS application deadline of 30 June 2021 for those resident in the UK by the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, the range of measures laid before Parliament today will also make sure that the Home Office can ensure the integrity of the EUSS, protecting it against fraud and abuse. They include changes to the way reasonable grounds for late applications to the scheme are considered. We are also closing 2 temporary transitional routes, both of which fall outside the UK’s Withdrawal Agreement commitments.

Lord Murray, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Migration and Borders, said:

Automatic extension of pre-settled status ensures that many EU, other EEA and Swiss citizens and their family members in the UK can continue to make a hugely valued contribution to British society without fear of losing their immigration status by simply failing to apply for settled status.

The measures we’ve announced today will also enable us to continue robustly tackling spurious EUSS applications, freeing up resource for legitimate late applicants and status-holders, and delivering for the UK public.

Renting your first place in the private rented sector while at university can be a daunting task, but it needn’t be with all the measures the Government has put in place to drive up standards and protect tenants.

Knowing your rights – as well as your responsibilities – ensures you’ll live in a safe and comfortable environment and will be able to hold your landlord or agent to account if certain standards aren’t met.

There are lots of things the Government requires landlords to do. To make understanding all this simple, we’ve put together a definitive guide to renting that tells you everything you need to consider, know and do.

Check out the ‘How To Rent’ guide

By law, your landlord or letting agent is required to protect your deposit in a Government-approved scheme within 30 days of taking it. These schemes ensure your money can’t be misused, lost or kept from you when you’re entitled to it back. There are only three:

Your landlord or agent must also provide you with all the information on the scheme they’ve used within 30 days. If they fail to do either of these things they lose their ability to evict you with asection 21 notice.

There is a useful guide on what to do if your landlord breaks your tenancy deposit protection scheme rules available fromShelter.

The rules aroundhouses in multiple occupation (HMO)will be changing on 1 October 2018. Among other things, the new rules set out a minimum bedroom size; no less than 6.51 square metres for a single adult.

They also make it mandatory for landlords to adhere to council refuse schemes and ensure their properties have adequate waste facilities.

Councils may give landlords up to 18 months to make changes to ensure their HMOs comply with the bedroom size rules, but if you’ve just taken out a two-year tenancy you should consider now how these rules will affect your property in the future.

It is your landlord or agent’s responsibility to ensure the property is kept up to standard. This includes arranging prompt and certifiable repairs when utilities like gas, water and electricity fail, repairing or replacing faulty appliances, and maintaining the condition of the property.

All letting agents and property managers in England must belong to a Government approved redress scheme. There are only two:

These schemes provide help in resolving disputes between landlords, agents and tenants, and are a safeguard for when you’re unable to resolve a dispute yourself.

Following theministerial announcementin December 2023 to launch an innovation challenge series under the AUKUS partnership, this competition is the first iteration of AUKUS Pillar 2’s Innovation Challenge Series. The challenge has been trilaterally agreed and is being run as three separate competitions by theAdvanced Strategic Capabilities Accelerator(ASCA) in Australia, DASA in the United Kingdom and theDefense Innovation Unit(DIU) in the United States. This is the first time that DASA has worked in conjunction with both Australia and the US within one competition, enabling defence to leverage the best technologies available across the three nations for this challenge.

AUKUS is a landmark security and defence partnership between Australia, the UK, and the US to support a free and open Indo-Pacific by strengthening regional global security. Through Pillar 2, AUKUS partners seek to strengthen trilateral capabilities in cutting-edge military technologies, increase interoperability, and drive knowledge-sharing and innovation.

This competition seeks innovative technologies that can provide Defence with a competitive advantage to electromagnetic (EM) targeting and protect Defence from adversary EM targeting capabilities. The electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) is a heavily congested, contested, complex and competitive environment, and there is an increasing need for low cost, disposable, high volume and highly autonomous capabilities to maintain advantage over our adversaries.

We are looking for innovation technologies that can be developed and transitioned to improve the following six key elements of the targeting cycle;

The following capabilities are expected to have the greatest impact and potential for success, these include, but are not limited to:

We are seeking innovation proposals and industry partners that have the ability to innovate and deliver at pace.

Up to £117 million expected private industry investment will be combined with £70 million government investment through its modern Industrial Strategy to develop new technologies. These will range from a new and secure hardware prototype that can cope with cyber-attacks, to software protected from new vulnerabilities appearing online – each to ensure that every UK organisation and consumer online is as secure and resilient to cyber threats as possible.

With cyber threats constantly evolving, the best defence in the future is seen as developing innovative solutions that can work independently and protect against threats even during attacks. The government wants to ensure that every UK organisation is as cyber secure and resilient as possible.

Nearly all UK businesses are reliant on digital technology and online services, yet more than 30% have experienced a cyber-security breach or attack in the last 12 months. Hackable home wifi routers can be used by attackers in botnets to attack major services and businesses.

Consumers are often the worst affected by mass information leaks than the organisation that held their data. Businesses are having to spend increasing amounts on cyber security, up to 20 to 40% of their IT spend in some cases. And as more and more systems are connected, whether in the home or businesses, there is a need for security that is secure by design.

Business Secretary Greg Clark said:

Digital devices and online services are powering more of our daily lives than ever before, from booking a doctors’ appointment to buying online shopping. While these devices and services bring great benefits to businesses and consumers, they come with the associated risks of cyber-attacks and threats that are becoming increasingly complex to tackle.

As we move to a more data-driven economy, nearly all UK businesses and organisations are reliant on these digital technologies and online services – but the threat of cyber-attacks is ever-present, with more than 30% of businesses having experienced a cyber-security breach or attack in the last 12 months.

With government and industry investing together as part of our modern Industrial Strategy, we will ensure that the UK is well placed to capitalise on our status as one of the world leaders in cyber security by ‘designing in’ innovative measures into our technology that protect us from cyber threats. This will also help us bring down the growing cybersecurity costs to businesses.

This expected joint investment will create projects to develop new solutions to cyber security over the next 5 years, with the aim of applying the findings in real-world markets through dedicated demo-projects led by business. For example, these demo projects could include testing the new technology in the health sector to ensure a higher level of protection for patient data, or in consumer markets to ensure consumers’ personal data is fully protected as far as possible.

Ann Johnson, Corporate Vice President, Cybersecurity Solutions Group at Microsoft said:

At Microsoft, we embrace our responsibility to help empower organisations on their digital transformation journey to unlock the security and compliance capabilities of the intelligent cloud and next generationAI.

We support the vision behind the Digital Security by Design Initiative that helps bring digital security by design into the central hardware of tomorrows computers and have committed financial resources to collaborate across these exciting new proposed activities.

Ben Laurie, Head of Security and Transparency at Google said:

At Google we place a high priority on the security of data and believe that the proposed Digital Security by Design initiative is vital to bridge the gap between the realities of the hardware development cycle and those of commercial software companies.

We need proven hardware architectural changes that permit the secure and efficient separation of data so we can provide the user control of data in distributed systems, a problem thought otherwise impractical to address. We will commit significant resources to this program, the results of which will be open source and available to the whole industry.

UK Research and Innovation Chief Executive, Professor Sir Mark Walport said:

As our use of internet connected devices has rapidly increased, so too has our vulnerability to broader and more sophisticated cyber threats. This challenge will drive changes in the UK’s digital computing infrastructure to enhance cybersecurity for businesses, government and citizens. It will help make the UK a market leader in delivering digitally secure products and services.

Interim Challenge Director at UK Research and Innovation, Professor John Goodacre said:

In the next 5 years this challenge will radically update the foundation of the insecure digital computing infrastructure that underpins the entire economy, therefore increasing cyber security for businesses, government and across society. It will boost productivity for the UK via reduction of days lost to cyber-attacks while helping to make the UK market leaders in delivering the first digitally secured products and services

Dr Ian Levy, National Cyber Security Centre’s Technical Director said:

The National Cyber Security Centre is committed to improving security from the ground up, and we have been working closely with government to promote adoption of technology and practices to protect the UK.

We hope this additional investment will drive fundamental changes to products we use every day. This is vital work, because improving hardware can eradicate a wide range of vulnerabilities that cause significant harm.

Developing innovative solutions to cyber security will help put the UK at the forefront of theAIand data revolution, in support of the government’sAIand Data Grand Challenge.

Details on the upcoming rounds of funding for this Digital Security by Design challenge, which will likely bring together academics, research institutions, start-ups,SMEsand large businesses, will be announced later this year.

The £70 million ofgovernment fundingDigital Security by Design challenge will be delivered by UK Research and Innovation through the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund.

The UK government is fully committed to defending against cyber threats and address the cyber skills gap to develop and grow talent. A 5-year National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) was announced in November 2016, supported by £1.9 billion of transformational investment.

In today’s climate it has never been a more important time to innovate in food production and simultaneously tackle environmental, sustainability and social issues.

VEXo has been developed by husband and wife team chef Andy Holcroft and entomologist Dr Sarah Beynon, who between them have also founded the UK’s first full-time edible insect restaurantGrub Kitchenand the multi award-winning research centre and visitor attractionDr Beynon’s Bug Farm.

The innovative VEXo can be used in a similar way to minced meat, whilst reducing saturated fat by over 80%. 
Nearly one-third of 2-15 year olds are overweight or obese, with obesity costing the NHS in Wales around £73 million.

The edible insect industry has grown at a staggering rate across Europe and North America over the past few years, fueled by an expanding human population demanding new, more sustainable sources of protein.

Insects are exceptionally nutrient-dense and environmentally sustainable to produce,” said VEXo co-inventor Sarah.

Many insects contain weight-for-weight a similar amount of protein to beef and they can contain all nine essential amino acids. Insects can be farmed in high-welfare farms while requiring very little feed, water and space and emitting hardly any greenhouse gases.

Bug Farm Foods was funded by the Welsh Government and Innovate UK under the Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) project to find a way to harness the nutrients contained in insects and deliver them in a form that is acceptable to our western palettes.

The new law will come into force on 31 March 2023, before the busy summer period and will enable watercraft users to be prosecuted and bound by the same laws that apply to ships in order to help to prevent accidents.

This follows a boom in the watercraft industry during the pandemic, with the number, size, power and availability of watercraft like jet skis increasing, and their use inUKwaters rising significantly.

Today’s (18 January 2023) move by the government will help ensure theUKcontinues to have some of the safest waters in the world.

Maritime Minister, Baroness Vere said:

The watercraft industry is thriving and it’s great to see more and more people enjoying leisure activities. However, they must do so safely.

That’s why we’re introducing a new law to crack down on any dangerous misuse of watercraft like jet skis. It will give the Maritime and Coastguard Agency greater power to prosecute those responsible for causing accidents or entirely avoidable tragedies.

We’ll continue working to ensure our country’s coasts and waters are safe for everyone.

Watercraft are not currently covered by wider maritime safety legislation. The new law will mean those found guilty of using their watercraft in a dangerous manner could receive an unlimited fine and/or up to 2 years in prison.

For those who cause accidents involving loss of life, the new offences could be used to better prosecute perpetrators alongside wider manslaughter charges.

Personal and recreational watercraft will also be bound by the ‘Highway Code of the sea’ – international regulations which require users to act safely by maintaining a lookout, driving at safe speeds and outlining their responsibilities to other vessels.

As of 15 August, there are 3,195 confirmed and highly probable cases of monkeypox in the UK. Whilst the decline is fastest in London, new cases continue to be identified in all regions at present.

Out of 3,025 confirmed cases in England, 2,989 were men (99%) and 36 were women. The median age of cases in the UK is 36. Based on the available data, the virus continues to be transmitted primarily in interconnected sexual networks of gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) and there is no robust evidence of sustained transmission outside these networks. Some new cases which may be linked to travel continue to be identified.

As of 17 August 2022, a total of 33,199 administered doses of vaccine have been recorded, of which 29,803 have been administered as pre-exposure vaccination, primarily toGBMSM. A further 1,767 doses have been given to healthcare workers managing monkeypox cases and 1,629 doses have been given to close contacts of cases.

Dr Meera Chand, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections, UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

Whilst there are fewer new cases being identified, we are detecting cases in all regions of England and the global outbreak continues. We ask that everyone checks themselves for monkeypox symptoms, including rashes and blisters, particularly if you have had new sexual partners recently – in the UK or abroad.

If you are eligible for a vaccine, please wait to be called forward by the NHS and you will receive one as soon as supply is available in your area. We are working with the manufacturer to expedite delivery as quickly as possible.

If you are concerned that you may have monkeypox symptoms, take a break from events, meeting with friends or having sexual contact. Instead, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice.

UKHSAwill continue to publish regular technical briefings as the response to the outbreak continues.

From 9am this morning, small business owners can apply to accredited lenders by filling out a simple online form, with only seven questions.

The government has also agreed with lenders that an affordable flat rate of 2.5% interest will be charged on these loans. And any business that has already taken out a Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan of £50,000 or less can apply to have these switched over to this generous new scheme.

The Bounce Back Loan scheme is the latest step in a package of world-leading support measures launched by Chancellor Rishi Sunak – with £7.5 billion already awarded in business grants, 4 million jobs supported through the job retention scheme and generous tax deferrals supporting hundreds of thousands of firms. To apply, see further information about theBounce Back Loan scheme.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, said:

Small businesses will play a key role creating jobs and securing economic growth as we recover from the Coronavirus pandemic.

The Bounce Back loan scheme will make sure they get the finance they need - helping them bounce back and protect jobs.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma said:

We are backing small businesses, which are the backbone of our communities, with the support they need to stay afloat.

This new scheme of 100% government-guaranteed loans gives owners of even the smallest businesses the confidence and flexibility to borrow a sum which works for them.  This will help ensure they can continue to trade, and be a key part of our efforts to reboot the British economy.

As part of the scheme, small businesses can borrow between £2,000 and £50,000. The government will provide lenders with a 100% guarantee and cover the cost of any fees and interest for the borrower for the first 12 months. No repayments will be due during this period to enable firms to get back on their feet.

The loans are available through a network of lenders, including the five largest banks.

Government support for business of all sizes:

Mike Cherry, National Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said:

“We know many small firms have struggled to secure small loans speedily. We are pleased that the Chancellor has listened, and swiftly developed this new scheme for small businesses to access finance quickly, interest-free for the first year and at an affordable fixed interest rate for the remainder.”

Tej Parekh, Chief Economist at the Institute of Directors (IOD) said:

“The government has kept an open ear to businesses, and continues to adapt its coronavirus response, which is very welcome. The business interruption loan scheme has started to reach firms, but small firms were still having difficulty accessing finance. This additional measure should help more of those firms get the cash they need to see them through the weeks and months ahead.”

Stephen Jones, CEO, UK Finance said:

The Bounce Back Loans Scheme will help smaller businesses and sole traders rapidly access the finance they need by filling in a simple form online with an accredited lender.

This builds upon the broad package of support that lenders are already offering to help SMEs through these tough times, including capital repayment holidays, extended overdrafts and billions of pounds worth of lending.

Accredited lenders approved to offer Bounce Back Loans have worked at pace with the Treasury to get this scheme up and running by Monday, and staff are now focused on processing applications and getting money to businesses as quickly as possible.

Rob Hattrell, Vice President of eBay UK said:

This is extremely welcome news for small businesses up and down the country who trade online and offline, including the 300,000 who trade on eBay on a daily basis. Many of Britain’s SMBs are really struggling financially in the current crisis. Hopefully, this move from government will help our very smallest businesses get the financing they need quickly to manage their cash flow or replenish their stock.

While the existing CBIL scheme may be appropriate for some businesses, our smallest businesses told us that they were finding it hard in practice to access this support from banks. By extending the current government guarantee from 80% of each loan to 100%, we hope this will make it more likely that banks will extend finance at a critical time. And by making it simpler to apply, SMBs should be able to get the help they need quickly just when they need it most.

Dr. Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said:

“The launch of the Bounce Back Loan Scheme is an important milestone in getting credit flowing to small firms who have so far struggled to access the financial support they need. The standardisation of the interest rate that can be charged after the first 12 months is a welcome step in helping firms manage their ongoing costs.

“We look forward to working with the government, British Business Bank and UK financial institutions to ensure that the new scheme supplies cash to businesses on the ground quickly.”

Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Chief Economist, said:

The Chancellor is standing shoulder-to-shoulder with small businesses to help them through the crisis.

A 100% government guarantee on loans and a simple way of applying will be a lifeline to many small businesses and sole traders under pressure.

In the past year, almost one fifth of 12-15 year olds encountered something online that they ‘found worrying or nasty in some way’ and 64% of 13-17 year olds have seen images or videos offensive to a particular group. Nearly half of adult users also say they have seen something that has upset or offended them on social media.

TheInternet Safety Green Paperaims to tackle these growing dangers, while continuing to embrace the huge benefits and opportunities the Internet has brought for British citizens.

Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Karen Bradley said:

The Internet has been an amazing force for good, but it has caused undeniable suffering and can be an especially harmful place for children and vulnerable people

Behaviour that is unacceptable in real life is unacceptable on a computer screen.
We need an approach to the Internet that protects everyone without restricting growth and innovation in the digital economy.

Our ideas are ambitious - and rightly so. Collaboratively, government, industry, parents and communities can keep citizens safe online, but only by working together.

The strategy sets out the government’s ambition to create a strong framework which can tackle online harms. All options will be carefully considered, working collaboratively with industry and charities and supporting children, parents and carers.

Today’s is the first generation of children who are learning about relationships and sex in an online world. So the Strategy also outlines the crucial role that education will play in raising online safety awareness, with a particular focus on children and parents:

It is proposed that theUK Council for Child Internet Safetybecomes the UK Council for Internet Safety to consider the safety of all users, not just children, and help deliver the measures within the Strategy.

Vicki Shotbolt, Chief Executive Officer at Parent Zone said:

Meeting the challenges of the digital age is something parents do every day. It is encouraging to see the government proposing concrete steps to ensure that industry is doing everything they can to support families and make the Internet a place that contributes to children flourishing.

David Wright, Director of the UK Safer Internet Centre said:

As the national centre dedicated to making the UK the safest place in the world to be online, the UK Safer Internet Centre, a partnership of three charities - Childnet, the Internet Watch Foundation and South West Grid for Learning – welcomes the Government’s Internet Safety Strategy, which reflects our own work and priorities.

Technology plays a fundamental role in everyone’s lives presenting both opportunities and threats. Our aim, like this strategy, is to promote national collaboration around these issues to deliver positive change among children and young people across the UK -  and those who support them -  through education and increased awareness of the safe and responsible use of technology.

As part of our work to make Britain the safest place in the world to be online, today’s announcement complements the action already taken by government to stop the spread of poisonous material and propaganda on the internet that could lead people down the path towards terrorism.

Recently the UK and France joined forces to tackle online radicalisation with plans that could lead to much stronger action against tech companies who fail to remove unacceptable content.

ENDS

The Government has already consulted a wide range of stakeholders including charities, academic researchers and technology companies while developing the objectives and initiatives in the Green Paper.

This is just the first part of work to develop a Digital Charter, which will provide a framework for how businesses and individuals should act online so everyone can benefit from new technologies.

Alongside the Strategy, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has published a literature review undertaken by Professor Sonia Livingstone, Professor Julia Davidson, and Dr Joanna Bryce, on behalf of the UK’s Council for Child Internet Safety (UKCCIS) Evidence Group.

While DCMS will take a leading role in delivering the Strategy, it will work with a wide range of partners across Government, including the Home Office, the Department for Education, the Department for Health and the Ministry of Justice.

Reporting to social media companies is low amongst those who recognise they have been cyberbullied. Children, particularly those who had no direct experience of reporting issues, had little confidence in social media companies to resolve cyberbullying (Cyberbullying: Research into the industry guidelines and attitudes of 12-15 year olds.

The amount of children exposed to hate content online seems to be rising. 64% of children and young people aged 13-17 have seen people posting images or videos that are offensive to a particular targeted group (Power of image: A report into the influence of images and videos in young people’s digital lives, UK Safer Internet Centre (2017)).

More than four in ten adults users say they have seen something that has upset or offended them on social media in the past 12 months (Adults’ media use and attitudes, - Ofcom report (2017)).

Ofcom estimates that the average weekly time spent online for all adults in 2016 was 22.9 hours, 1.3 hours more than 2013. 5-15 year olds spend 15 hours a week online; exposing themselves to risks. Even 3-4 year olds who go online are spending 8 hours per week doing so (Children and parents: media use and attitudes, Ofcom (2016))

In the past year, almost one fifth of 12-15 year olds encountered something online that they ‘found worrying or nasty in some way’ (Children and parents: media use and attitudes, Ofcom (2016)).

Half of UK adult internet users say they have concerns about what is on the Internet. These concerns relate mainly to offensive/ illegal content (38%), risks to others/ society (22%) and concerns about security/ fraud (20%). Other concerns include personal privacy (9%) and advertising (7%) (Adults’ media use and attitudes, Ofcom (2017)).

The grant will be worth 70% of their average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering three months’ worth of profits, and capped at £6,570 in total.

The Chancellor also set out more details on how the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) will continue to support jobs and business as people return to work, following the announcement of an extension of the scheme on 12 May.

So far, the CJRS has helped 1 million employers across the UK furlough 8.4 million jobs, protecting people’s livelihoods.

From 1 July 2020, businesses will be given the flexibility to bring furloughed employees back part time. This is a month earlier than previously announced to help support people back to work. Individual firms will decide the hours and shift patterns their employees will work on their return, so that they can decide on the best approach for them - and will be responsible for paying their wages while in work.

From August 2020, the level of government grant provided through the job retention scheme will be slowly tapered to reflect that people will be returning to work. That means that for June and July the government will continue to pay 80% of people’s salaries. In the following months, businesses will be asked to contribute a modest share, but crucially individuals will continue to receive that 80% of salary covering the time they are unable to work.

The scheme updates mean that the following will apply for the period people are furloughed:

Chancellor Rishi Sunak said:

Our top priority has always been to support people, protect jobs and businesses through this crisis. The furlough and self-employment schemes have been a lifeline for millions of people and businesses.

We stood behind Britain’s businesses and workers as we came into this crisis and we stand behind them as we come through the other side.

Now, as we begin to re-open our country and kickstart our economy, these schemes will adjust to ensure those who are able to work can do so, while remaining amongst the most generous in the world.

Employers will be required to submit data on the usual hours an employee would be expected to work in a claim period and actual hours worked. Employees who believe they are not getting their 80% share can also report any concerns to the HMRC fraud hotline. HMRC will not hesitate to take action against those found to be abusing the scheme.

Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, Director-General of Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said:

The government’s support throughout the lockdown so far has been a lifeline for businesses, employees and the self-employed. The changes announced will help ensure the schemes stay effective as we begin a cautious recovery.

Introducing part-time furloughing at the same time as more stores and factories start to open will help employees to return to work gradually and safely. Many more businesses will feel supported during this vital restart phase.

Firms understand the scheme must close to new entrants at some point and that those using it in future will need to make a contribution to help manage the costs. However, previously viable firms not able to open until later, particularly in leisure, hospitality and the creative industries, may need further assistance in the coming months.

Mike Cherry, National Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said:

The furlough and self-employed schemes have been a true lifeline for all those protected by them – continuation, certainty and increased flexibility will boost economic recovery and help us get through the turmoil created by the coronavirus.

Small firms have long been the backbone of the UK economy and these policies will help keep it that way. Keeping the self-employed and those who work in a small business attached to the labour market is crucial to prevent scarring of the economy – the package today gives certainty and support to millions.

We will continue to work with the Government to make sure small firms can come out the other side and get back to what they do best – creating jobs, fuelling growth and powering our communities forward.

Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said:

The Chancellor has listened to business communities and struck a careful balance that will help many firms bring furloughed staff back to work flexibly over the coming months.

The gradual reduction in furlough contributions from the Treasury will give businesses additional time to rebuild their income streams and cash flows, and the decision to give businesses maximum flexibility to bring people back part-time will be appreciated.

The extension of support for the self-employed will come as welcome relief for those who have seen their livelihoods impacted by the virus. It is right that this group continues to receive similar levels of support to those on PAYE.

Edwin Morgan, Director of Policy at the Institute of Directors (IOD) said:

The furlough scheme has played an immense role protecting jobs, and business leaders understand it couldn’t be sustained at the same level forever. This is a much more gradual tapering than many were expecting, reflecting the concerns the IoD has raised. The ability to bring people back part-time is crucial, and we’re delighted the Treasury has taken on board our members’ calls to bring this in as soon as possible.

Extending SEISS is also a welcome move, and reflects the immense challenges many self-employed people are facing.

Derek Cribb, CEO of the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed (IPSE), said:

It will be an overwhelming relief to self-employed people who are eligible for SEISS that their support has been extended. It is very welcome that the Chancellor has once again heeded our calls and taken steps to get many of the self-employed, who are particularly struggling in the Coronavirus crisis, the income support they so badly need.

Brian Berry, Chief Executive of the Federation of Master Builders (FMB), said:

We strongly welcome the extension of the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme, which means construction tradespeople will not face a cliff-edge in terms of support. This is essential for those who are not yet able to return to work. Furthermore, introducing flexibility into the Job Retention Scheme will give businesses the scope they need to scale-up activities at the right pace for their firm. Retaining the construction workforce is essential to ensure the industry stands ready to build back better as the country recovers from the impact of the coronavirus.

Stephen Phipson, CEO of Make UK, the manufacturers’ organisation commented:

It is welcome news for manufacturers that monetary support to businesses through the Job Retention Scheme will remain unaltered for the next two months giving businesses much needed time to recover order books and start to get production levels back on track. Crucially the Chancellor has also delivered the flexibility which industry so desperately needs to bring its workforce back in a staggered way allowing for imaginative working patterns until business recovers.

Industry has always accepted that Government could not continue to pay indefinitely and understands that cost to the taxpayer had to be reduced. But this gradual increase in the amount companies contribute to their employee wage bill will buy companies vital time before they are asked to take on the full cost burden.

The Chancellor has today protected many more jobs and kept vital skills within the sector to help power the economic recovery which the country so needs as we come out of the COVID crisis and the extension of the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will also help protect vital elements of the supply chains as we go forward.

Steve McNamara, General Secretary of Licensed Taxi Drivers Association (LTDA) said:

The extension to the furlough scheme for the self employed is much needed and fantastic news for Cabbies across the Country. It highlights how the Chancellor is listening to, and helping those who need it, well done!",Increased Climate Finance Commitments,Monetary,Welfare,id25_804

The funding kickstarts the UK’s new Clean Green Initiative (CGI), which will help to scale up public and private investment in quality, sustainable infrastructure globally.

The Prime Minister will emphasise the importance of providing climate finance for the developing world, the democratisation of green tech and other solutions to the climate crisis at an Action and Solidarity Roundtable this afternoon at COP26, alongside the leaders of India, the United States and 24 other countries.

To support the Clean Green Initiative the UK will deliver over £3 billion in climate financing for green growth in developing countries over the next five years, including £200m for a new Climate Innovation Facility. This is double the amount the UK’s development finance institution, the CDC, invested in climate projects its previous strategy period from 2017-2021.

The Climate Innovation Facility will support the scale-up of technologies to help communities deal with the impacts of climate change, such as drought-resistant agriculture and sustainable forestry, in markets where private investors have been reluctant to take on the risk alone. It will be delivered by CDC in partnership with the private sector.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:

I want to see the UK’s Green Industrial Revolution go global. The pace of change on clean technology and infrastructure is incredible, but no country should be left behind in the race to save our planet.

The climate has often been a silent victim of economic growth and progress – but the opposite should now be true. Through the Clean Green Initiative, we can help to build back better and greener from the pandemic and put the world on the path to a more sustainable future.

The UK aid-backed Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG) will also commit more than £210m in new investment today to back transformational green projects in developing countries. The financing will go to schemes including electric vehicle manufacturing in India, green bonds in Vietnam and solar power in Burkina Faso, Pakistan, Nepal and Chad – projects which are expected to mobilise more than £470m ($650m) in additional private sector finance.

In addition, the UK is announcing a package of guarantees to multilateral development banks that will provide a major boost to investments in climate-related projects in India and across Africa.

A new ‘Room to Run’ guarantee to the African Development Bank (AfDB) is expected to unlock up to £1.45 billion ($2 billion) worth of new financing for projects across the continent, half of which will help countries adapt to the impacts of climate change. For example, it is expected to support the AfDB’s work on generating high-quality climate data to help countries plan for future impacts, water resource management and helping farmers increase their resilience to drought.

The UK will also provide an ‘India Green Guarantee’ to the World Bank, to unlock an additional £750 million ($1 billion) for green projects across India. The financing will support clean and resilient infrastructure in sectors such as clean energy, transport and urban development.

The Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said:

Developing countries need the right form of investment to help drive clean growth, whilst dealing with the impacts of climate change.

The opportunities are clear and this new initiative will enable us to seize them, working closely with our allies to deliver honest and responsible investment and cleaner and more reliable infrastructure in the developing world.

The Clean Green Initiative is a key part of the UK’s contribution to the G7 Build Back Better World initiative announced at the Carbis Bay Summit in June. It is intended to be a long-term approach to help developing countries bridge the infrastructure gap, while supporting climate change and sustainable development goals.

The UK will work, through the CGI and with the support of Mark Carney in his role as the PM’s Finance Adviser for COP26, to support the development of country partnership platforms to make it easier for vulnerable countries to get access to climate finance. The national-level platforms would coordinate between governments, donors, development banks and the private sector to connect the pipelines of green projects with funding and investments.","Support for sectors through existing government grants and schemes (Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme, Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Grants, 12 month business rates holiday, £200 million of emergency public funding through the Arts Council, Historic England and National Lottery Heritage Fund)",Welfare,,id25_805

Based on the analysis from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the delivery plan shows that developed countries will make significant progress towards the $100 billion goal in 2022, and provides confidence that it will be met in 2023. The data also provides confidence that developed countries can mobilise more than $100 billion per year thereafter through to 2025.

Climate finance plays a critical role in helping developing countries fight climate change and adapt to its impacts. In 2009, developed countries agreed to mobilise $100 billion in climate finance per year by 2020, and in 2015 agreed to extend this goal through to 2025. While developed countries have significantly scaled-up their support over the last decade, new analysis shows the $100 billion goal was unlikely to have been met in 2020 and is likely to also fall short in 2021 and 2022.

Ahead ofCOP26,COPPresident-Designate Alok Sharma asked Jonathan Wilkinson, Canada’s Minister of Environment and Climate Change and Jochen Flasbarth, Germany´s State Secretary at the Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, to work together to produce a Delivery Plan on the $100 billion commitment, to demonstrate how and when developed countries will deliver on their promise.

Building on assessments of progress on the $100 billion goal to date, the Delivery Plan sets out an estimated trajectory of climate finance from 2021 through to 2025 - taking into account new climate finance pledges from individual developed countries and multilateral development banks. It also sets out principles on how to improve the delivery of climate finance.

Whilst it is disappointing that the goal has not been met so far, the redoubling or significantly increased efforts from a large number of developed countries - including the UK, Canada, Germany and others – means we are now much closer to the target and are delivering funds to support countries on actions against climate change.

Private climate finance has also underperformed against expectations, the plan makes clear that more needs to be done in this respect, but does not rely on a significant improvement in this for the goal to be met by 2023.

Furthermore, based on consultations undertaken by Minister Wilkinson and State Secretary Flasbarth, additional pledges from developed countries may be expected this year but are not yet ready to be included in the analysis at the time of publishing. These are likely to further increase the projections outlined in the report.

The Plan lays out a set of guiding principles for collective actions of developed countries, including increasing financing for adaptation, addressing barriers in accessing climate finance, and improving private finance mobilisation.

Developed countries will continue to engage with developing countries and with civil society to ensure climate finance is delivered effectively, efficiently and at scale.

TheOECDsupported the work on this Delivery Plan with its expert analysis that provides aggregate, forward-looking estimates of an increase in climate finance from 2021 to 2025.

Climate finance will be key atCOP26in Glasgow later this month. Providing clarity on the timing and sources of funding is only the first step on the path towards delivery. Robust conversations will continue atCOP26on ways to ensure countries are collectively doing what is needed to deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement.

COP26President-Designate Alok Sharma said:

The Delivery Plan sets out how developed countries will deliver the $100 billion goal that has long been promised to developing nations.

Scaling up climate finance has been one of my top priorities asCOPPresident. This plan recognises progress, based on strong new climate finance commitments. There is still further to go, but this Delivery Plan, alongside the robust methodological report from theOECD, provides clarity, transparency and accountability. It is a step towards rebuilding trust and gives developing countries more assurance of predictable support.

We can and must do more to get finance flowing to developing nations. So in the lead up toCOP26, it’s vital we see further pledges from developed countries and action on key priorities such as access to finance and funding for adaptation.

The Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Canada’s Minister of Environment and Climate Change said:

It is critically important for developing countries to be able to trust that the developed world will make good on its promises, starting with the $100 billion climate finance goal. Earlier this year, our Government doubled its climate finance commitment and is proud to have taken on this leadership role with Germany, at the request of theCOP26President-Designate. While more work needs to be done, I hope that today’s report can instill confidence and trust that developed countries will deliver on their promises to the developing world, and that Canada will continue to be a constructive player to this end internationally.

German State Secretary Jochen Flasbarth, Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nuclear Safety and Natural Conversation said:

Developing countries have been rightfully disappointed that so far developed countries have not delivered on the $ 100 billion pledge that was already given in 2009. Hence, I am glad that the process I was honoured to lead jointly with Minister Jonathan Wilkinson has created momentum to help complying with the finance commitment overall in the period up to 2025. We are very aware that also after today’s release of the Delivery Plan, a lot of work remains. However, it is my strong hope that with this plan, we can show the international community that developed countries remain committed to deliver on their promises.

I can assure you that Germany is strongly committed to the $100 billion target. In 2020, we provided in total 7,8 billion EUR for international climate finance. We intend to increase the fraction of our climate finance coming from our national budget  from 4 billion EUR in 2020 to prospectively 6 billion EUR in 2025. Thus, we will continue to provide our share in the years to come.

In 2009, developed countries committed to a goal of mobilising jointly $100 billion a year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries, in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation. This collective goal was reaffirmed under the Paris Agreement in 2015 as Parties committed to continue delivering on this goal through 2025[A7] .

In June 2021, the Prime Minister of Canada announced that Canada will double its international climate finance commitment, to $5.3 billion over the next five years. Canada’s increased commitment to climate finance includes an increased focus on adaptation and recognises that urgent action is needed to address the interconnected crises of climate change and biodiversity loss, which disproportionally affect the poorest and most vulnerable.

Since 2015, the Government of Canada has invested over $100 billion in clean growth.  The Government of Canada’s existing climate actions put Canada on a path to exceed its previous target and allowed the government to set an ambitious new target of 40-45% reductions below 2005 levels by 2030 earlier this year.

Greenhouse gas emissions in Germany fell by 40.8 percent from 1990 to 2020. Germany is to become climate neutral by 2045 and has outlined a path to achieve this with binding targets for the 2020s and 2030s

The interim target for 2030, currently 55 percent, is being increased to a 65 percent greenhouse gas reduction compared to 1990. A new interim reduction target of 88 percent has been set for 2040.

Climate action efforts up to 2045 will thus be more appropriately distributed across the current and future generations.Germany is moving away from coal during the 2030s. Coal-fired power generation is set to end by 2038 at the latest.

By its Climate Change Act Germany has retained the system of year-specific permissible emission levels for the individual sectors for this decade, with these levels significantly reduced.

The new German 2030 climate target also takes account of the new, higherEUclimate target for 2030, which all member states agreed on at the end of 2020 during Germany’s Council Presidency.

TheEUand its Member States, acting jointly, are now committed to a binding target of a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990. In July 2021, the European Commission tabled the “Fit for 55” package which has the aim of aligningEUclimate policy with the new NDC of theEUand its Member States.

With new 2030 mitigation targets this year from the Canada, Japan and the U.S., combined with ambitious action from theEUand U.K., countries accounting for more than half of the world’s economy have now committed to the pace of emission reductions required globally to limit warming to 1.5°C.

The financial support for international climate action has been consistently increasing and on a high level in recent years. In 2020, Germany provided in total 7.83 billion EUR for international climate finance. As part of that, Germany was significantly surpassing it´s pledge to double climate finance from budgetary sources to 4 billion EUR by 2020. As announced at the G7 summit, Germany also wants perspectively to further increase its climate finance from budgetary sources, from 4 to 6 billion EUR annually by 2025 at the latest.

The United Kingdom holds the Presidency ofCOP26, this year’s international climate meeting and negotiations. Climate finance is one of the fourCOP26goals, a key priority for the UK’sCOP26Presidency.

In 2019, the UK doubled its climate finance commitment to £11.6bn between April 2021 and March 2026, compared with the previous five year commitment of £5.8bn between April 2016 and March 2021. These amounts follow on from the £3.8bn ICF spent between April 2011 and March 2016.",Criminalisation of squatting,Legislative,Other,id25_806

Following the consultation the Government decided to criminalise squatting in all residential buildings to deal once and for all with the misery that squatting can cause.

Justice Minister Crispin Blunt said:

‘For too long squatters have had the justice system on the run and have caused homeowners untold misery in eviction, repair and clean-up costs. Not any more. Hard working homeowners need and deserve a justice system where their rights come first - this new offence will ensure the police and other agencies can take quick and decisive action to deal with the misery of squatting.’

The offence will be punishable by a maximum prison term of up to six months, a £5000 (maximum) fine or both.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

‘For too long, hardworking people have faced long legal battles to get their homes back from squatters, and repair bills reaching into the thousands when they finally leave.

‘No longer will there be so-called ‘squatters rights’. Instead, from next week, we’re tipping the scales of justice back in favour of the homeowner and making the law crystal clear: entering a property with the intention of squatting will be a criminal offence. And by making this change, we can slam shut the door on squatters once and for all.’

Association of Chief Police Officers lead on Uniformed Operations, Chief Constable Phil Gormley, said:

‘Our experience is that the problem of squatting varies between police forces and it is more pressing in some areas than others.

‘However, police can now act immediately and remove squatters directly from properties in line with the new legislation and ensure people’s homes are protected.’

The new offence will protect homeowners or legitimate tenants who have been excluded from their homes.

It will also protect those who own residential buildings that they don’t live in, such as landlords, local authorities or second home owners. Previously, their only option was to seek a civil court order to regain possession of their properties, which could be time consuming, expensive and stressful.","Setting UK Government departments’ resource budgets for the years 2021/22 to 2023/24 and capital budgets for the years 2021/22 until 2024/25, and devolved administrations’ block grants for the same period.",Welfare,,id25_808

This is the first step towards ensuring prisoners make financial reparation to victims and communities.The money will go to the national charity Victim Support and pay for new support services, helping victims to recover from the trauma of crime and forcing criminals to take responsibility for the harm they caused.

The Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice, Nick Herbert, said:

‘For too long the financial burden of repairing the damage done by crime has fallen to the taxpayer alone.  By bringing into force the Prisoners’ Earnings Act, this Government is making a significant and overdue change.

‘Making offenders pay financial reparation to victims will require them to take personal responsibility for their crimes and go some way towards making redress to victims through the funding of crucial support services.’

Javed Khan, chief executive of Victim Support, said:

‘Helping victims to find their strength after crime is our number one priority. We will use the money from this initiative to deliver real, practical support for victims and communities.

‘Getting prisoners working and developing workplace skills should help them on the path to reform. This will be very much welcomed by victims as they are united in wanting offenders to stop committing crimes.’

Implementing the Prisoners’ Earnings Act is the latest stage in Government action to reform the criminal justice system to make punishment more effective and reduce reoffending. This includes making prisons place of hard work, getting criminals off drugs and alcohol, toughening community sentences and making offenders pay back to victims and communities for their crimes.

On average, prisoners working inside prisons earn less than £10 per week, working as prison cleaners, cooks or in prison workshops. However, up to 500 offenders who have passed a rigorous risk assessment, work outside the prison gates to help prepare for their release. It is hoped their contributions through the PEA will earn up to £1million a year.

In July, the Government announced that families bereaved by homicide would receive additional funding - as recommended in the Victims’ Commissioner’s review into the needs of bereaved families. From today, peer support groups for those bereaved by homicide, can apply to receive part of a new £150,000 fund.

This is in addition to £2.25 million being invested in the Homicide Service and in specialist, voluntary organisations which provide bereaved families with a dedicated caseworker, emotional support and practical help to cope with housing, benefits and funeral arrangements.",Trade negotiations with international partners,Legislative,,id25_809

The CSR will prioritise:

Due to unprecedented uncertainty, the Chancellor did not fix a set spending envelope, but confirmed that departmental spending (both capital and resource) will grow in real terms across the CSR period and that the government will deliver on the commitments made at Budget to level up and invest in the priorities of the British people.

Given the impact COVID-19 has had on the economy, the Chancellor was clear there will need be tough choices in other areas of spending at the review. As part of their preparations for the CSR departments have been asked to identify opportunities to reprioritise and deliver savings. Departments will also be required to fulfil a series of conditions in their returns, including providing evidence they are delivering the government’s priorities and focussing on delivery.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, said:

The first phase of our economic response to coronavirus was about safeguarding employment as far as possible. Our goal in the second phase is to protect, create and support jobs and we set out our plan to achieve this two weeks ago.

The Comprehensive Spending Review is our opportunity to deliver on the third phase of our recovery plan – where we will honour the commitments made in the March Budget to rebuild, level up and invest in people and places spreading opportunities more evenly across the nation.

Government will launch new trade strategy to help deliver its growth mission, with UK businesses and economic growth at the centre

UK was the world’s 4th largest exporter in 2022, with British goods and services in high demand across the globe

Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds has announced the Government’s intention to deliver trade talks, starting with the Gulf Cooperation Council, India, Israel, South Korea, Switzerland and Turkey.

The Government is putting economic growth at the heart of everything it does to improve the livelihoods of hardworking British people.

Restarting talks is the first step towards agreeing the high-quality trade deals the UK needs to give businesses access to international markets, boost jobs and deliver that growth.

With exports totalling £855 billion, the UK was the world’s 4th largest exporter in 2022. High-quality British goods and services are admired globally and the Government is committed to using every lever available to help British businesses sell around the world.

FTAs are not the only tool to drive economic growth through trade. The Government also plans to publish a trade strategy which aligns with our industrial strategy, enhances our economic security and supports our net zero ambitions.

Through this trade strategy, resetting our relationship with the EU, supporting more small businesses to export and tearing down unnecessary barriers to trade, jobs and communities will be supported in every part of the UK.

Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said:

Boosting trade abroad is essential to deliver a strong economy at home. That’s why I’ve wasted no time taking stock of progress and getting ready to press on with trade talks with our international partners.

From the Gulf to India, our trade programme is ambitious and plays to the UK’s strengths to give British businesses access to some of the most exciting economies in the world.

Our teams will be entering negotiating rooms as soon as possible, laser-focused on creating new opportunities for UK firms so they can support jobs across the country and deliver the growth we desperately need.

This announcement will kickstart the process of getting negotiators back into the room with counterparts as soon as possible, with the first round of trade talks under the new government expected to take place during the Autumn.

The UK’s trade programme aims to deliver deals that will benefit the UK economy and boost trade with some of the most dynamic economies in the world.

For example, a trade agreement with the Gulf Co-operation Council would be a substantial economic opportunity, with at least £19 billion total already invested in each other’s economies as of 2021. An agreement with the GCC could potentially boost this further, ensuring British companies can make the most of this booming market and British customers get even more choice.

India, with which the UK is negotiating a Free Trade Agreement and Bilateral Investment Treaty, is projected to be the world’s third largest economy by 2027. A trade deal would give UK businesses better access to its burgeoning market of middle-class consumers, projected to grow to over a quarter of a billion consumers by 2050.

It comes after the Foreign Secretary visited India this week to discuss economic and global security.

Chairman of Tata Sons Natarajan Chandrasekaran said:

I am delighted that the new government has moved so quickly to restart trade negotiations with India. As one of the largest international investors in the UK, the Tata Group supports any action that strengthens the British economy. And as two of the world’s greatest trading nations with deep historical ties, India and the UK should be close economic partners, to the benefit of the citizens and businesses of both countries.

CEO of KOC Holding AS Levent Çakıroğlu said:

I believe that the negotiations for a new FTA can foster greater competitiveness, offer business opportunities across various sectors, and will strengthen bilateral trade ties between our two countries.

In the upcoming negotiations, there is room for improvement for both economies in services and investment sectors, but I believe automotive and home appliances business will continue to form the backbone of the trade between Türkiye and the UK in the future.

CEO of Roche Thomas Schinecker said:

Roche welcomes the UK government’s decision to resume talks about a free trade agreement between the United Kingdom and Switzerland. Free trade is essential for economic growth and stability.

Head of Trade Policy at the British Chambers of Commerce William Bain said:

Businesses are eager to open the doors to closer trade links with our key partners and will welcome the government’s renewed commitment to seek free trade agreements.

Reaching new or upgraded deals could offer new opportunities for businesses, of all sizes, to grow and invest for the future, especially in sectors like spirits, business services, climate friendly technology and pharmaceuticals.

Director General of the Chartered Institute of Export & International Trade Marco Forgione said:

The news that the Government has kicked off trade talks with these key economies so quickly is extremely positive. Making international trade easier and helping more UK businesses expand into international markets is central to getting growth into the economy.

We know there’s real business interest in making international trade easier and we stand ready to work with the Department to ensure businesses, particularly SMEs, are armed with the know-how to turn these opportunities into reality.

The Government is also committed to the CPTPP trading group, using our membership in the UK and her allies’ interests and ensuring businesses can take advantage of the deal when it enters into force.

The Coronavirus Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Schemewas announced at Budget as part of a package of support measures for businesses affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.

This scheme will allow small and medium-sized employers, with fewer than 250 employees, to apply to HMRC to recover the costs of paying coronavirus-relatedSSP.

Employers will be able to make their claims through a new online service from 26 May. This means they will receive repayments at the relevant rate ofSSPthat they have paid to current or former employees for eligible periods of sickness starting on or after 13 March 2020.

Tax agents will also be able to make claims on behalf of employers.

To prepare to make their claim, employers should keep records of all theSSPpayments that they wish to claim from HMRC.You can read further guidance on checking whether you can claim backSSPpaid to employees due to coronavirus (COVID-19) on GOV.UK.

Secretary of State for the Department of Work and Pensions, Therese Coffey, said:

We are committed to supporting Britain’s small and medium businesses through this pandemic with a comprehensive package of support.

This rebate will put money back in the pockets of millions of employers, ensuring they can hit the ground running as the economy re-opens.

Angela MacDonald, HMRC’s Director General of Customer Services, said:

Our teams have worked hard to deliver this scheme for employers and their employees to ensure they get the support they need. We want employers to be secure in the knowledge they will receive help as they care for their staff during this difficult period.

Employers are eligible if they have a PAYE payroll scheme that was created and started before 28 February 2020 and they had fewer than 250 employees before the same date.

The repayment will cover up to 2 weeks ofSSPand is payable if an employee is unable to work because they:

The current rate ofSSPis £95.85 per week[1]. Employers can choose to go further and pay more than the statutory minimum. This is known as occupational or contractual sick pay.

Connected companies and charities can also use the scheme if their total combined number of PAYE employees is fewer than 250 on or before 28 February 2020. Employees do not have to provide a doctor’s fit note for their employer to make a claim under the scheme.

Employers can furlough their employees who have been advised to shield in line with public health guidance and are unable to work from home, under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. Once furloughed, the employee should no longer receiveSSPand would be classified as a furloughed employee. Where an employee has been notified to shield and has not been furloughed, the rebate will compensate up to 2 weeks ofSSPfrom 16 April 2020.

Rishi Sunak said the newBounce Back Loans scheme, which will provide loans of up to £50,000, would help bolster the existing package of support available to the smallest businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

The scheme has been designed to ensure that small firms who need vital cash injections to keep operating can get finance in a matter of days, and comes alongside the £6 billion awarded in business grants, supporting 4 million jobs through the job retention scheme and generous tax deferrals supporting hundreds of thousands of firms.

The government, which has been consulting extensively with business representatives about the design of the new scheme, will provide lenders with a 100% guarantee for the loan and pay any fees and interest for the first 12 months. No repayments will be due during the first 12 months.

The loans will be easy to apply for through a short, standardised online application. The loan should reach businesses within days- providing immediate support to those that need it as easily as possible.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, said:

Our smallest businesses are the backbone of our economy and play a vital role in their communities. This new rapid loan scheme will help ensure they get the finance they need quickly to help survive this crisis.

This is in addition to business grants, tax deferrals, and the job retention scheme, which are already helping to support hundreds of thousands of small businesses.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma said:

Our small businesses are vital in ensuring our communities thrive and will be crucial in creating jobs and securing economic growth as we recover.

This rapid loan scheme offers additional protection so small companies across the country can get access to the finance they need immediately, as part of the unprecedented package of support we have put in place.

The scheme will launch for applications on Monday 4 May. Firms will be able to access these loans through a network of accredited lenders.

The government will work with lenders to ensure loans delivered through this scheme are advanced as quickly as possible and agree a low standardised level of interest for the remaining period of the loan.

Our Covid-19 support schemes have provided over £15 billion for business in just a few weeks. We’ve put in place:

Mike Cherry, Federation of Small Businesses National Chairman, said:

This crucial new initiative should enable thousands of small businesses to access the working capital they need quickly, helping to protect the millions of jobs they provide in every part of the UK.

This step forward marks another decisive intervention from the Treasury and the Business Department, building on existing support in an innovative way. Swift delivery is now key, and we also look forward to working with government in the long-term to enhance market competition, including that provided by non-bank lenders.

We are pleased to see the Chancellor and the Business Secretary listening to the needs of small businesses, and we will continue to work with them to make sure small firms and the jobs they provide are protected throughout this public health challenge and that small firms are at the forefront of leading the recovery.

Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI Director-General, said:

The Chancellor’s new 100% guaranteed loan scheme for small businesses is transformational. Sole traders, micro-firms and entrepreneurs will now have a simple route to fast finance to stay afloat, without red tape or time-consuming checks.

Thousands of businesses could be saved by this lifeline. Banks now need to continue their work in overdrive to get the loans flowing faster.

It’s good to see the Chancellor listening to business, proving that where there’s a need to adjust schemes, he will do what it takes. It will be vital to maintain this approach in the months to come. Every job saved today will ensure a faster recovery tomorrow.

Jonathan Geldart, IoD Director General:

This is a welcome intervention, which should help ensure more firms can access the finance that could see them through this crisis. Business leaders will appreciate the government’s continued flexibility in adapting their response to what’s happening on the ground.

It’s crucial that the government’s support cuts through to those who need it. Having a quick and simple process will be vital, and we need to remember that taking on debt is always a difficult decision for small firms.

Adam Marshall, BCC Director General:

The grant will be worth 70% of their average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering three months’ worth of profits, and capped at £6,570 in total.

The Chancellor also set out more details on how the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) will continue to support jobs and business as people return to work, following the announcement of an extension of the scheme on 12 May.

So far, the CJRS has helped 1 million employers across the UK furlough 8.4 million jobs, protecting people’s livelihoods.

From 1 July 2020, businesses will be given the flexibility to bring furloughed employees back part time. This is a month earlier than previously announced to help support people back to work. Individual firms will decide the hours and shift patterns their employees will work on their return, so that they can decide on the best approach for them - and will be responsible for paying their wages while in work.

From August 2020, the level of government grant provided through the job retention scheme will be slowly tapered to reflect that people will be returning to work. That means that for June and July the government will continue to pay 80% of people’s salaries. In the following months, businesses will be asked to contribute a modest share, but crucially individuals will continue to receive that 80% of salary covering the time they are unable to work.

The scheme updates mean that the following will apply for the period people are furloughed:

Chancellor Rishi Sunak said:

Our top priority has always been to support people, protect jobs and businesses through this crisis. The furlough and self-employment schemes have been a lifeline for millions of people and businesses.

We stood behind Britain’s businesses and workers as we came into this crisis and we stand behind them as we come through the other side.

Now, as we begin to re-open our country and kickstart our economy, these schemes will adjust to ensure those who are able to work can do so, while remaining amongst the most generous in the world.

Employers will be required to submit data on the usual hours an employee would be expected to work in a claim period and actual hours worked. Employees who believe they are not getting their 80% share can also report any concerns to the HMRC fraud hotline. HMRC will not hesitate to take action against those found to be abusing the scheme.

Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, Director-General of Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said:

The government’s support throughout the lockdown so far has been a lifeline for businesses, employees and the self-employed. The changes announced will help ensure the schemes stay effective as we begin a cautious recovery.

Introducing part-time furloughing at the same time as more stores and factories start to open will help employees to return to work gradually and safely. Many more businesses will feel supported during this vital restart phase.

Firms understand the scheme must close to new entrants at some point and that those using it in future will need to make a contribution to help manage the costs. However, previously viable firms not able to open until later, particularly in leisure, hospitality and the creative industries, may need further assistance in the coming months.

Mike Cherry, National Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said:

The furlough and self-employed schemes have been a true lifeline for all those protected by them – continuation, certainty and increased flexibility will boost economic recovery and help us get through the turmoil created by the coronavirus.

Small firms have long been the backbone of the UK economy and these policies will help keep it that way. Keeping the self-employed and those who work in a small business attached to the labour market is crucial to prevent scarring of the economy – the package today gives certainty and support to millions.

We will continue to work with the Government to make sure small firms can come out the other side and get back to what they do best – creating jobs, fuelling growth and powering our communities forward.

Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said:

The Chancellor has listened to business communities and struck a careful balance that will help many firms bring furloughed staff back to work flexibly over the coming months.

The gradual reduction in furlough contributions from the Treasury will give businesses additional time to rebuild their income streams and cash flows, and the decision to give businesses maximum flexibility to bring people back part-time will be appreciated.

The extension of support for the self-employed will come as welcome relief for those who have seen their livelihoods impacted by the virus. It is right that this group continues to receive similar levels of support to those on PAYE.

Edwin Morgan, Director of Policy at the Institute of Directors (IOD) said:

The furlough scheme has played an immense role protecting jobs, and business leaders understand it couldn’t be sustained at the same level forever. This is a much more gradual tapering than many were expecting, reflecting the concerns the IoD has raised. The ability to bring people back part-time is crucial, and we’re delighted the Treasury has taken on board our members’ calls to bring this in as soon as possible.

Extending SEISS is also a welcome move, and reflects the immense challenges many self-employed people are facing.

Derek Cribb, CEO of the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed (IPSE), said:

It will be an overwhelming relief to self-employed people who are eligible for SEISS that their support has been extended. It is very welcome that the Chancellor has once again heeded our calls and taken steps to get many of the self-employed, who are particularly struggling in the Coronavirus crisis, the income support they so badly need.

Brian Berry, Chief Executive of the Federation of Master Builders (FMB), said:

We strongly welcome the extension of the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme, which means construction tradespeople will not face a cliff-edge in terms of support. This is essential for those who are not yet able to return to work. Furthermore, introducing flexibility into the Job Retention Scheme will give businesses the scope they need to scale-up activities at the right pace for their firm. Retaining the construction workforce is essential to ensure the industry stands ready to build back better as the country recovers from the impact of the coronavirus.

Stephen Phipson, CEO of Make UK, the manufacturers’ organisation commented:

It is welcome news for manufacturers that monetary support to businesses through the Job Retention Scheme will remain unaltered for the next two months giving businesses much needed time to recover order books and start to get production levels back on track. Crucially the Chancellor has also delivered the flexibility which industry so desperately needs to bring its workforce back in a staggered way allowing for imaginative working patterns until business recovers.

Industry has always accepted that Government could not continue to pay indefinitely and understands that cost to the taxpayer had to be reduced. But this gradual increase in the amount companies contribute to their employee wage bill will buy companies vital time before they are asked to take on the full cost burden.

The Chancellor has today protected many more jobs and kept vital skills within the sector to help power the economic recovery which the country so needs as we come out of the COVID crisis and the extension of the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will also help protect vital elements of the supply chains as we go forward.

At present, businesses above the VAT threshold of £85,000 are covered by the system, which requires them to keep digital records and provide VAT returns through software. Since it was introduced in 2019 more than 1.4 million businesses have joined the programme, submitting over 6 million returns.

From April 2022, the programme will be extended to all VAT registered businesses with turnover below the VAT threshold (£85,000), and from April 2023, it will apply to taxpayers who file income tax self-assessment tax returns for business or property income over £10,000 annually.

Financial Secretary to the Treasury, Jesse Norman, said:

We are setting out our next steps on Making Tax Digital today, as we bring the UK’s tax system into the 21st century.

Making Tax Digital will make it easier for businesses to keep on top of their tax affairs.  But it also has huge potential to improve the productivity of our economy, and its resilience in times of crisis.

Making Tax Digital changes will affect the way that taxes are reported, not the level of tax that is collected. It will help to minimise avoidable mistakes – which cost the exchequer £8.5 billion in 2018-19.

The long lead-in time will allow businesses, landlords and agents time to plan. It also gives software providers enough notice to bring a range of new products to market, including free software for businesses with the simplest tax affairs.

Over 30% of smaller VAT-registered businesses, who are not yet required to use Making Tax Digital, have chosen to do so voluntarily because of the wider benefits the digital tools offer, including fewer errors and increased productivity.

Other countries have already done this - Denmark introduced a digital system back in 2014, and digital reporting is now well-established and has reduced the amount of time businesses spend on their tax affairs.

The extension is part of a number of announcements which deliver on government commitments and give taxpayers clarity over the future direction of travel. As part of this, the government is today also publishing draft legislation for the next Finance Bill, a regular annual publication.

Businesses have benefitted from over £32 billion in loans and guarantees to support their cashflow during the crisis. This includes 268,000 Bounce Back Loans worth £8.3 billion, 36,000 loans worth over £6 billion through the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, and £359 million through the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme, alongside £18.7 billion through the CCFF.

Companies borrowing more than £50 million through CLBILS will be subject to restrictions on dividend payments, senior pay and share buy-backs during the period of the loan, including a ban on dividend payments and cash bonuses, except where they were previously agreed.

These restrictions will also apply to CCFF participants that wish to borrow money beyond 12 months from today. This will ensure that the money is used to keep the company going through the crisis. The Bank will also publish a list of companies who are benefitting under CCFF on 4 June.

The restrictions in place will include:

This will replace the EU’s Common External Tariff on 1 January 2021 at the end of the Transition Period.

Our new tariff is tailored to the needs of the UK economy. It will support the economy by making it easier and cheaper for businesses to import goods from overseas. It is a simpler, easier to use and lower tariff regime than the EU’s Common External Tariff (EU CET) and will be in pounds (£), not euros. It will scrap red tape and other unnecessary barriers to trade, reduce cost pressures and increase choice for consumers and back UK industries to compete on the global stage.

The Government is taking a common-sense approach to our new tariff schedule by streamlining and simplifying nearly 6,000 tariff lines, and lowering costs for businesses by reducing administrative burdens. The changes include scrapping unnecessary tariff variations, rounding tariffs down to standardised percentages, and getting rid of all “nuisance tariffs” (those below 2%).

We are also getting rid of the EU’s complex Meursing table, allowing us to scrap thousands of unnecessary tariff variations on products - including over 13,000 tariff variations on products like biscuits, waffles, pizzas, quiches, confectionery, and spreads.

The UKGT also expands tariff free trade by eliminating tariffs on a wide range of products. The UKGT ensures that 60% of trade will come into the UK tariff free on WTO terms or through existing preferential access from January 2021, and successful FTA negotiations will increase this.

This will lower costs for businesses, ensuring they can compete on fair terms with the rest of the world, as well as keeping prices down and increasing choice for consumers.

The Government is maintaining tariffs on a number of products backing UK industries such as agriculture, automotive and fishing. This will help to support businesses in every region and nation of the UK to thrive. 
Some tariffs are also being maintained to support imports from the world’s poorest countries that benefit from preferential access to the UK market.

The UKGT was designed following widespread engagement with businesses across the UK. As it will come into force on 1 January 2021, it’s important that businesses can familiarise themselves with the new tariff regime ahead of this date.

We are backing UK industry by:

UK consumers will also benefit from more choice and lower costs on numerous goods thanks to zero tariffs. These include, for example:

We will promote a sustainable economy by cutting tariffs on over 100 products to back renewable energy, energy efficiency, carbon capture, and the circular economy. The following are all dropping to zero tariffs:

Almost all pharmaceuticals and most medical devices (including ventilators) are tariff free in the UKGT. However, some products used to fight COVID-19 maintain a tariff. To ensure those working on the frontline can access vital equipment easily, the UK has introduced a temporary zero tariff rate on these products. This relief waives the tariff and VAT for personal protective equipment (PPE), medical devices, disinfectant and medical supplies from non-EU countries. The Government is committed to continuing to waive the tariffs on key COVID-19 items should this be necessary upon implementation of the UKGT in 2021. A list of goods that relief can be claimed on can be found onGOV.UK: COVID-19 Commodity Codes List.

For the first time in 50 years we are able to set our own tariff regime that is tailored to the UK economy.

Our new Global Tariff will benefit UK consumers and households by cutting red tape and reducing the cost of thousands of everyday products.

Examples of these workers include NHS staff, police and supermarket delivery drivers who need to be able to go to work to support the country’s fight to tackle coronavirus. A full list of workers can be found ongov.uk.

Vulnerable children include those who have a social worker and those with Education, Health and Care Plans – a legal document that describes a child’s special educational needs and the support they require. Children who do not fall into these groups should remain at home with appropriate care.

Where schools are unable to look after these children, local authorities will work with the Department for Education’s regional teams to ensure an alternative option is available in the same area.

Registered early years providers, including childminders, private schools and sixth forms should also follow this guidance. The Department will provide financial support for these settings as required.

Where possible, the Department would encourage settings to also look after key workers’ children and vulnerable children throughout the Easter holidays.

The scientific advice shows that these settings are safe for this small number of children to continue attending – but asking others to stay away will help us to slow the spread.

To lift the pressure on schools themselves and to allow them to focus on supporting those children who need it most, Ofsted will cease all inspections of schools and colleges with immediate effect.

The government will not go ahead with primary school assessments or secondary exams this summer, and will not be publishing performance tables. It will work with the sector and Ofqual to ensure children get the qualifications they need.

The Department recognises that many special schools and residential settings will need to continue to look after their pupils.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said:

Fighting Coronavirus and protecting the vulnerable and our NHS are the Government’s top priorities right now. That’s why we are asking schools, nurseries and colleges to close – except for vulnerable children and the children of key workers.

We are facing increasingly extraordinary circumstances, but by asking schools to support our key workers and vulnerable children I am confident we will help beat this virus.

I am deeply grateful for the civic spirit and dedication of everyone working in education, and I will continue to provide my full support throughout this crisis.

To support children eligible for free school meals, schools will be able to provide meals or vouchers for supermarkets or local shops.

The government has also confirmed that the total value of vouchers offered to each eligible child per week will exceed the rate it pays to schools for free school meals, recognising that families will not be buying food in bulk and may therefore incur higher costs. The final amounts will be confirmed shortly viaguidance for schools.

Effective immediately, schools will be able to order vouchers directly from supermarkets or shops in their communities to be emailed or printed and posted to families, and they will have their costs covered by the Department for Education.

Many universities and other higher education institutions are already taking necessary steps to keep their staff and students safe. The Department for Education is confident vice-chancellors are making the right decisions and it continues to support them in doing so.

To support nurseries at this time, the Chancellor has also decided that they will also now be eligible for a business rates holiday for one year. That means non-local authority providers of childcare will pay no business rates in 2020-21, from 1 April.

Local authorities will be fully compensated for the cost of this measure.  The Barnett formula will be applied to this additional support in England.

Guidance for local authorities on the application of the holiday will be published by MHCLG shortly.

The announcement marks a major step in getting the arts and cultural sectors fully back up and running, and follows the government’s announcement of £1.57 billion of funding for the arts, culture and heritage sector earlier this month, the biggest ever one off investment in these industries.

The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport is working with the sector on pilots of performances with socially distanced audiences that will inform final guidance for venues in the run up to August 1. These include the London Symphony Orchestra at St Luke’s, London with a variety of further events in the coming weeks.

This announcement marks the move to stage 4 of the government’s 5-stage roadmap for the return of professional performing arts. Under the new regime, audiences, performers and venues will be expected to maintain social distancing at all times.

Guidance for the performing arts, published earlier this month, also sets out further measures to support the safe return of audiences, including:

The UK’s performing arts sector is renowned across the world and I am pleased that we are making real progress in getting its doors reopened to the public with social distancing. From August indoor theatres, music venues and performance spaces will safely welcome audiences back across the country.

This is a welcome step in the path to a return to normal and, coupled with our £1.57 billion rescue package, will help secure the future of this important sector.

Singing and the playing of brass and wind instruments in groups or in front of an audience is still currently limited to professionals only.

‘These reforms represent a substantial package of reform and are a significant step towards realising the goals that the Prime Minister set out in Strasbourg.

‘Taken together, these changes should mean fewer cases being considered by the court. Those that it considers should be allegations of serious violations or major points of interpretation of the Convention and will be processed without the scandalous delays we are seeing at present.

‘The court will not normally intervene where national courts have clearly applied the Convention properly. These reforms strengthen the commitment of all the member states to the obligations of the Convention and will improve the ability of the Court to enforce these obligations sensibly.’

Attorney General Dominic Grieve said:

“This Declaration makes clear that the primary responsibility for guaranteeing human rights rests with the government, parliament and courts of a country. It sets out clearly that the Court should not routinely overturn the decisions made by national authorities - and it should respect different solutions and different approaches between states as being legitimate.

‘The Court is there to ensure the highest protection of fundamental rights. This agreement secures this vital position for the court and will allow it to do the job it was created to do and protect individuals across Europe from state oppression.’

Reform of the Court was one of the key priorities for the UK’s chairmanship of the Council of Europe and the foundations of today’s reforms were laid in a speech given to the Court by Prime Minister David Cameron in a speech earlier this year.

In that speech, the Prime Minister outlined the challenges faced by the court as being:

822,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/djanogly-more-efficient-dispute-resolution-needed,Press release,Djanogly: More efficient dispute resolution needed,"The Government will lead by example by committing to using better, quicker and more efficient ways of resolving legal disputes.",Ministry of Justice and Jonathan Djanogly,23 June 2011,"Britain’s largest employer today signed the first ever Dispute Resolution Commitment (DRC) which requires all Government departments and agencies to use alternatives such as mediation, arbitration and conciliation wherever possible before taking disputes to court.

Making more use of the wide range of options available to resolve disputes has already saved taxpayers an estimated £360 million over the last decade. Today’s signing of the DRC will build on this and save further time, money and stress for everyone involved by reducing their legal and court costs, and in turn reducing the number of cases unnecessarily clogging up the courts.

The commitment is the latest in a series of Government moves to encourage people and businesses to take responsibility for their own disputes, rather than turning to lawyers and judges to resolve issues.

It follows proposals, earlier this year, for the first major overhaul of the civil justice system in 15 years to tackle fears that a damaging compensation culture and an unwieldy justice system is costing businesses millions of pounds and deterring deserving individuals from using the justice system.

This would mean more people will use mediation before they can go to court and more cases will be dealt with by quicker methods. This follows changes introduced to the family justice system in April this year, which introduced a new pre-action protocol, requiring separating couples to attend mediation assessment sessions, after research showed it can cost a quarter of the price and take a quarter of the time of going to court.

The new DRC was announced today by Justice Minister Jonathan Djanogly and Attorney General Dominic Grieve QC MP, the Government’s chief legal adviser.

Mr Djanogly said:

‘I believe that government should be leading by example by resolving issues away from court using alternatives which are usually quicker, cheaper and provide better outcomes.

‘We want people to see court as a last resort rather than a first option, and cut down on the amount of unnecessary, expensive, painful and confrontational litigation in our society.

‘In many cases methods like mediation are simply a common sense solution which benefits everyone involved. Although they will not be suitable in every case, they are already saving taxpayers millions every year and can save much more.’

The DRC will renew and strengthen the Alternative Dispute Resolution Pledge made by Government in 2001. In the decade since the Pledge was made alternatives to court have been used for hundreds of disputes, saving taxpayers an estimated figure of more than £360m.

Mr Grieve said:

‘There will still be cases which need to be litigated, notably where a legal precedent is needed to clarify the law or where it would not be in the public interest to settle a claim. However, the Government remains fully committed to resolving legal disputes by dispute resolution techniques other than litigation wherever it is possible and acceptable to both sides.’

Under the DRC, Government departments and agencies should seek alternatives to court action wherever possible and where all parties involved in the dispute agree. It is intended to help parties to explore solutions in a spirit of co-operation, enabling them to maintain good business relationships. It also promotes managing issues before they become disputes.

The Treasury Solicitor, Paul Jenkins QC said:

‘The Treasury Solicitor’s Department handles most litigation brought against government.  Wherever possible we actively explore ways of settling disputes without the need to go to court. In many cases this has produced large savings for all parties in terms of cost, time and disruption. So I strongly support the ‘commitment’, and its promotion of a flexible and constructive approach to the resolution of disputes.’",Safeguarding directions and discretionary property schemes,Administrative,,id25_822

Transport Secretary Chris Grayling today (15 November 2016)confirmed the majority of the preferredHS2route from Crewe to Manchester and the West Midlands to Leedsin a major boost for theUK’s future economic prosperity and a further clear signal the country is open for business.

This is a major step towards:

The newHS2trains will carry over 300,000 people a day and will triple seats available out of Euston at peak hours, freeing up space on the existing network for additional commuter and freight services.

HS2will create around 25,000 jobs during construction as well as 2,000 apprenticeships. It will also support growth in the wider economy, worth an additional 100,000 jobs.

The direct benefits ofHS2will reach far beyond the towns and regions directly served by the newly built railway lines. As the full network is completed, newHS2trains will continue up the East and West Coast Main Lines, serving areas including:

HS2 improving connections between our cities and regions.

Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said:

Our railways owe much to the Victorian engineers who pioneered them, but we cannot rest on their legacy when we face overcrowding and capacity problems.

HS2is an ambitious and exciting project and the government is seizing the opportunity it offers to build a transport network fit for the 21st century; one that works for all and makes clear to the world that Britain remains open for business.

The fullHS2route will be a game-changer for the country that will slash journey times and perhaps most importantly give rail passengers on the existing network thousands of extra seats every day. They represent the greatest upgrade to our railway in living memory.

But while it will bring significant benefits, I recognise the difficulties faced by communities along the route. They will be treated with fairness, compassion and respect and, as with Phase One, we intend to introduce further compensation which goes over and above what is required by law.

The Transport Secretary has today also announced thatHS2Ltdhas awarded a £900 million contract to:

so that construction on the first phase ofHS2between the West Midlands and London can get underway next year as planned.

On 29 August 2012, the Tier 4 sponsor licence ofLondon Metropolitan University (London Met) was revokeddue to non-compliance with its sponsorship duties.

This decision was made following a period of suspension and audits of the University’s student records by UKBA which identified a number of serious breaches of their sponsor duties.

London Met students with a current valid visa do not immediately face a change in their migrant status. They will receive direct information from the UK Border Agency to inform them of changes to their status.

BIS are convening a task force to be lead by HEFCE, which will include UUK, UKBA and the NUS, to work with London Met to support affected students and enable genuine students to find another institution at which they can continue their studies in the UK. The task force will start work immediately to protect the interests of these students.

The Government recognises the important contribution that international students make to the UK, and is committed to keeping our education system one of the best in the world.

We welcome all genuine and legitimate students, and there is no cap on the number of international students who can be accepted to study in the UK. We fully appreciate the economic benefits and wider enrichment these students bring to the UK. We want to encourage students to come and study at our world-class academic institutions.

Universities Minister David Willetts announced the formation of a task force to help overseas students affected by the decision:

“It is important that genuine students who are affected through no fault of their own are offered prompt advice and help, including, if necessary, with finding other institutions at which to finish their studies.

“We have asked HEFCE to lead a task force, which will include UUK, UKBA and the NUS, to work with London Metropolitan University to support affected students and enable them to continue their studies in the UK. The task force will start work immediately.”

He said that the decision affected only London Metropolitan University which had had its licence to sponsor non-EU students revoked. Britain remains a top class destination for international students, and welcomes them.

We recognise that there are concerns for legitimate overseas students who will be affected and London Metropolitan University has set up a Help Centre to support and advise students.

Pakistan and the UK have longstanding relations which are based on shared interests and mutual respect. Both leaders affirmed their commitment to further strengthen strategic and co-operative ties between the two countries by intensifying the UK-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue and confirming a yearly Summit. This Dialogue will deepen consultation on global and regional issues of peace and stability, will include people to people links, enhanced business investment and trade, collaboration in the education sector, and cultural and parliamentary links.

The two leaders welcomed the forthcoming launch of the British-Pakistan Foundation as an initiative to promote connections between our peoples.

Both leaders agreed that a strong, stable, secure and economically prosperous Pakistan is vital to global and regional peace and stability. In recognition of this, both leaders agreed to pursue closer development, economic and trade co-operation as part of the intensified Strategic Dialogue.

President Zardari underscored that Pakistan needs trade even more than aid. The Prime Minister said that the UK will continue to be Pakistan’s strongest ally in pursuing greater trade access to the EU for Pakistan.

Prime Minister Cameron expressed the UK’s support for Pakistan’s democratic government and expressed the UK’s solidarity and support for Pakistan coping with the damage caused by recent floods. He also expressed his condolences at the loss of precious lives and sympathy for the bereaved families. President Zardari expressed thanks for the UK’s pledge of £10 million of immediate relief for flood victims and for accelerating an already agreed £10 million bridge reconstruction programme.

Among the common challenges facing the UK and Pakistan is the fight against terrorism and violent extremism.  Both leaders agreed that terrorism and extremism are global issues and needed to be combated by intensifying cooperation at the global and regional levels.

Both leaders discussed the role being played by the democratic government in fighting against terrorism. The Prime Minister recognised the sacrifices made by Pakistan’s military, civil law enforcement agencies and people in fighting violent extremism and militancy and appreciated the efforts of the democratic government. Both leaders appreciated the close co-operation that already exists between respective police forces and other security agencies.

The two leaders agreed that such co-operation needs to and will intensify. In this regard the British Home Secretary would visit Pakistan in the Autumn. They asked the Joint Working Group on Counter Terrorism to make proposals for enhancing practical co-operation ahead of the visit.

Pakistan and the UK will intensify their strategic engagement and pursue comprehensive Ministerially-led co-operation under the framework of a summit level strategic dialogue process. This will be taken forward through annual contact between the British Prime Minister and the President/Prime Minister of Pakistan.

These Summit meetings will be reinforced through regular national security discussions.  The two leaders looked forward to the meeting between Pakistani Foreign Minister Qureshi and British Foreign Minister William Hague under the revitalised Dialogue in October.

The President invited the Prime Minister to make an early visit to Pakistan. The Prime Minister was pleased to accept.",Public expression of congratulations and celebration,Informational,,id25_826

Asked if the Transitional National Council (TNC) was still based in Benghazi, the PMS said they were still based in Benghazi but their intention was to get into Tripoli soon.

Asked if the Prime Minister was meeting the TNC in Benghazi, the PMS said he had meetings with the leadership in Tripoli this morning and they were there at the press conference.

Asked why the Prime Minister had gone to Libya and what it was all about, the PMS said the primary purpose of that trip was to meet with the TNC to demonstrate and offer them our support in the process of transition.

Asked about discussions about a new Security Council Resolution, the PMS said it was to be discussed at the UN that day.  It was a new resolution which reflected the progress that had been made in Libya and it would do things such as putting in place a much more straightforward and simple process for unfreezing of Libyan assets, which at the moment had to be done by unanimous agreement.

Asked if it referred to assets all around the world or assets in the UK, the PMS said the draft text referred back to the previous Security Council resolutions, 1970 and 1973.  It would put in place an easier process for unfreezing the assets frozen by those resolutions.

Put that there was criticism that the UK was being slow off the mark in securing business opportunities in Libya, PMS said that there was quite a lot to be done to stabilise the country and the situation there, but it was true that getting businesses working again and getting the economy growing again would be important for the stabilisation of Libya.  If you looked at some of the things we were discussing at the UN, one was to lift the no fly zone so that at some point commercial aircraft would be able to operate again and that would help support the Libyan economy.  One of the other things we were working on was decommissioning  surface-to-air missiles, which was also important so that commercial flights could start to operate safely.

If you went back to the start of the Arab Spring, some of the fundamental issues people were complaining about were economic.  We would certainly be looking at the issue of trade and that would involve trade between Libya and the UK, but there were other priorities to support the process of stabilisation.

Asked about the Palestinian bid to be recognised as a state and whether Britain would support it, the PMS said our position was that we would want to look at the detail of the proposal but would be guided by whatever we thought best supported the Middle East peace process.","Increased London Transport Capacity (including upgrades to underground stations, Jubilee line, Docklands Light Railway, Overground services, and the Javelin train service)",Administrative,Informational,id25_827

The PM said:

I congratulate the England cricket team on their fantastic achievement. Their performance in this test, including England’s highest ever innings score in a non timeless test, and Alistair Cook’s magnificent 294, against the team  that has up to now been ranked number one in the World, is a tribute to their domination of the sport.

It was a massive team effort, bowling India out twice for less than 250 and always being so sharp in the field. I watched the closing overs on the sofa at home and will remember the joy of the crowd at Edgbaston and England getting to number one in such style for a long time to come.

829,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/transcript-international-olympic-committee-press-conference,News story,Transcript: International Olympic Committee press conference,"PM: ""London will be ready on time and on budget; ready to welcome the greatest sporting events on the planet""","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street",29 March 2012,"Well good morning everyone.  It’s great to welcome Jacques, Sir Philip Craven and their teams to Downing Street today as the preparations for London 2012 enter what can only be described as the home straight.  Also, a very warm welcome to Seb, who has been an incredible driving force for this whole project since its inception.  This is the final inspection before the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.  And I believe the message is clear: London will be ready on time and on budget; ready to welcome the greatest sporting events on the planet.  This is going to be an extraordinary summer for the whole country: possibly the most exciting of our lifetimes.  We’ve got the Diamond Jubilee and the Olympics together offering three months of celebration of everything that’s great about Britain.

Now of course, there are vital preparations to be completed in the coming weeks, and there must be absolutely no complacency; there are still many things that need to be done.  So we’ve had some really important discussions this morning about three things in particular: about security; about transport; and about the legacy of the Games.  And I want to say a word about each.

On security, our first priority as a host nation must be to keep people safe.  So we’ll be mobilising every aspect of our security infrastructure.  There will be more police in the streets; there will be boats in the Thames and helicopters in the sky; troops will be assisting us in securing the venues; our intelligent services will be working round the clock.  This will be the biggest and the most integrated security operation in mainland Britain in our peace-time history.  But it will also been done in a way that is sensitive to the spirit of the Games.  Let me be absolutely clear: I’m determined this will feel like a sporting event with a really serious security operation rather than a security operation with really serious sporting event.  This is a very important point.

Second: transport.  Now we all know one of the big challenges of the Games will be the huge increase in the demand on our transport network.  That’s why we’ve increased London’s transport capacity: over 60 underground stations have been upgraded; 33% increase in the capacity on the Jubilee line; 50% increase in capacity on the Docklands Light Railway; refurbished and extended Overground services on the East London and North London lines; King’s Cross St. Pancras and Stratford stations transformed.  I was at King’s Cross a couple of days ago, it’s looking absolutely magnificent - step-free access and extra capacity.  And of course the special Javelin train service for fast access to the Olympic Park with extra late night trains and buses to help get people home afterwards.  Transport will be coordinated through a state‑of‑the-art transport coordination centre, with special information available about how people can best plan their journeys around London.  For the first time ever, our ambition is that all spectators will get to the venues by public transport, and we’ll do everything possible to ensure a first-class experience for athletes, for visitors and for spectators alike.

Third: legacy.  Jacques, as you’ve said very kindly, in London the Olympic movement is finding a legacy blueprint for future games - we’re very proud of that.  Put frankly, I think it’s time to tear up any notion of the Olympics leaving behind white elephants.  Legacy planning is further ahead than I think for any previous Olympic host city.  Six out of the eight venues already have long‑term futures agreed.  For example, the Aquatic Centre will become a major community facility for local people and will hope to welcome an expected 800,000 people every year.  The Handball Arena - where we held the cabinet meeting - will become the capital’s third largest arena with a capacity to host concerts, shows, exhibitions and events, and is likely to welcome half a million people every year.  The Athletes’ Village will provide affordable private housing.  The main stadium itself will become the National Centre for Athletics and host the 2017 World Athletics Championships.  And a strong collection of tenancy bids last week mean that we remain on course to re-open the stadium as a multi‑purpose venue in 2014.

But today’s report shows how the legacy of these games goes far wider than the venues.  A new Olympic-inspired school Games has involved half the schools in the entire country, with every school including opportunities for disabled children in their competitions.  With a billion pounds invested in youth sport, 6000 new community sports clubs, a thousand local sports venues upgraded, the Olympics will revitalise local sport in Britain for generations to come.

We’ve got 70,000 volunteers who will not only help make the Games happen but shape a new culture of volunteering across our country.  And our investment conferences will cement, I hope, an economic legacy from the Games that has already seen 40,000 people working on the biggest construction project in Europe.  With 3,500 business meetings at Lancaster House, an extra one billion pounds of new business for UK firms expected from Games-related trade campaigns, and a further 4.5 million extra tourists expected to visit Britain over the next four years, generating, we hope, 2.3 billion of extra spending and creating an extra 50,000 jobs.  So great sport, great culture, great business: a great legacy for Britain.

Now, we’ve already had a sense of the excitement and sporting passion we can expect this summer with world-class performances with the like of Ellie Simmonds in the Aquatic Centre and Sir Chris Hoy in the Velodrome.  Britain is embracing the Olympic spirit and is preparing to welcome the world’s greatest athletes.  In just over 50 days, the Olympic torch will arrive on these shores and will travel the length and breadth of the country as London becomes the first city ever to host the Games for a third time.  It’s an extraordinary honour for the United Kingdom, and we intend to repay that honour by showing why the Games is more relevant today than ever for the values it represents, the lives it can touch, and the unique opportunity it provides to encourage more young people to play sport.  The London Olympics and Paralympics will, I believe, be the greatest show on earth and we look forward to welcoming you all.  Jacques, over to you.

Thank you very much Prime Minister; ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  In exactly 44 days we will be in Ancient Olympia in Greece for the lighting of the Olympic flame.  And as the Prime Minister has said, the torch relay will start in Land’s End on 19th May in 50 days time.  And this torch relay will ignite the enthusiasm of the British public, but also of the public around the world.  And this will be the final straight of a seven-year long wait.

The IOC is extremely grateful to all the partners who have helped us in this very complicated enterprise.  Thank you to the government and the Prime Minister for its support; thank you to the city and the mayor; thank you to the local excellent work being done by LOCOG and Paul Deighton.  I’d like to thank also the British Olympic Association, because BOA will have a special responsibility to secure many gold medals upfront which is also very important for the spirit of these Games.  Good luck, Colin, for this endeavour.  I would also like of course to thank very warmly Denis Oswald and the team of the International Olympic Committee who has coordinated with our British friends.

We are confident that we will have great Games, but of course, we all know the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and that the final judgement of the Games will only be rendered at the closing ceremony of the Paralympic Games and not before.  However, I am very glad to say that already we have positive results in terms of the legacy.  There is already, before the Games even begin, a great legacy in East London, a great legacy of the sports venues, and there is the tangible legacy that there is a great economic return also.  Tourism will get a boost, and definitely there will be also a soft legacy: the enthusiasm of young kids to participate in sport; the enthusiasm for the heroes and the role models that they will watch on television or in the venues.

To conclude, Prime Minister, we are a happy International Olympic Committee.  Thank you very much.

Well if you’re happy, I’m happy.  Seb, are you happy?

I’m delirious, Prime Minister.  Thank you.

Not quite the same thing.

Thank you, thank you so much for hosting this this morning and welcome.  Present seven years ago, we made a promise in Singapore to connect young people with the inspirational extraordinary power of the Olympic and Paralympic Games.  We promised to place athletes at the heart of the project: we’ve done that.  We’ve promised to build new venues - as you quite rightly said, Prime Minister - that really had a strong and solid community use afterwards.  In doing so, I think we’ve created an extraordinary mix of iconic, new, existing and temporary venues.  We promised that the Games would regenerate East London, and I think anybody that’s been to the Olympic Park would recognise the extraordinary work that has been done there.  We promised a magical atmosphere, stadiums full of people that looked like they wanted to be there, and I don’t think there can be any question about the level of demand - both domestically and around the world - for our tickets.  We also promised to inspire young people, but not just in the United Kingdom, and we continue to do that.

There is a lot of work still to do, but I’ve seen extraordinary examples of new sports initiatives taking hold everywhere in this country: new clubs springing to life; the re-invigorated sports facilities; more coaching opportunities; more athletes visiting schools; more sport and certainly values being driven off the back of sport.  I’m immensely proud that it is sport that has kicked off this whole process.  We wanted to use the Games to leave a lasting legacy in sports participation in the lives of East Londoners, in challenging attitudes towards disability through the extraordinary power of the Paralympic Games; we are well on our way to achieving that.  When great athletes come to a great city for great sport, you will get great sport - but we want more than that.  We want inspiration; and that inspiration has to be nurtured and we can’t lose an ounce of the inspiration off the back of the Games.  From the very outset, we wanted to inspire young people.  I’ve been seeing sports participation at every level and at every age, and I’ve seen it in a way that I know has taken place and would have not have taken place if we had come back empty handed from Singapore.  The foundations, I believe, are in place.  We need to come back in 10 or 15 or 20 years time and be able to say that this was the moment that we captured the imagination of young people and challenged them to fashion their futures through sport.  Thank you.",Stricter benefit sanctions,Welfare,,id25_829

The government must set new standards for transparency, and our Coalition Programme for Government sets out a number of specific commitments. The government’s initial transparency commitments are set out below, alongside deadlines for publication. Limited exemptions on national security and personal privacy grounds will be permitted.

Given the importance of this agenda, the Deputy Prime Minister and I would be grateful if departments would take immediate action to meet this timetable for data transparency, and to ensure that any data published is made available in an open format so that it can be re-used by third parties. From July 2010, government departments and agencies should ensure that any information published includes the underlying data in an open standardised format.

Of course, the release of the datasets specified in the Coalition Programme is just the beginning of the transparency process. In advance of introducing any necessary legislation to effect our Right to Data proposals, public requests to departments for the release of government datasets should be handled in line with the principles underpinning those proposals: a presumption in favour of transparency, with all published data licensed for free reuse.

To oversee the implementation of our transparency commitments, a Public Sector Transparency Board will be established in the Cabinet Office, which will be chaired by the Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude. Board representation will include a mix of external experts and data users, and public sector data specialists; members will include Tom Steinberg, one of the UK’s leading experts on data transparency. The Board will provide support to departments as they deliver on the government’s transparency commitments set out in this letter. The Board will also be responsible for setting open data standards across the public sector, publishing further datasets on the basis of public demand, and - in conjunction with the Ministry of Justice - will further develop the Right to Data and advise on its implementation.

I look forward to welcoming rapid progress on this agenda in the coming weeks.

Building on the ambitious £7 billion employment package from Spring Budget the Chancellor is using his Autumn Statement to outline a new Back to Work Plan, which will expand the employment support and treatment available and reform the ways that people with disabilities or health conditions interact with the state.

Getting more people into work and ensuring work pays remains a key priority for the government. It is important for growing the UK economy, managing inflation, controlling spending, and improving living standards. Getting more people into good jobs is also good for those individuals and the best route out of poverty.

The government is boosting four key programmes – NHS Talking Therapies, Individual Placement and Support, Restart and Universal Support – to benefit up to 1.1 million people over the next five years and help those with mental or physical health conditions stay in or find work.

The new WorkWell service as announced at Spring Budget and delivered by the Departments for Work and Pensions and Health and Social Care is also being formally launched today and will support almost 60,000 long-term sick or disabled people to start, stay and succeed in work once rolled out in approximately 15 areas across England. The prospectus that will be launched in the coming weeks will provide information for all Integrated Care Systems across England to develop their localised work and health strategy.

Ministers are also planning to trial reforms to the fit note process to make it easier and quicker for people to get specialised work and health support, with improved triaging and signposting. Since the pandemic the number of people inactive in the UK due to long-term sickness or disability has risen by almost half a million to a record high of 2.6 million, with mental health, musculoskeletal conditions and heart disease being some of the main causes.

Stricter benefit sanctions will also be enforced by the Department for Work and Pensions for people who are able to work but refuse to engage with their Jobcentre or take on work offered to them. Benefit claimants who continue to refuse to engage with the Jobcentre will face having their claim closed. The latest published data shows that there were 300,000 people who had been unemployed for over a year in the three months to July.

The announcement today forms part of wider plans to grow the economy expected in the Autumn Statement on Wednesday 22 November. The Chancellor is set to reveal a raft of changes to get the UK economy growing including getting people back into work.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, said:

We’re serious about growing our economy and that means we must address the rise in people who aren’t looking for work – especially because we know so many of them want to and with almost a million vacancies in the jobs market the opportunities are there.

These changes mean there’s help and support for everyone – but for those who refuse it, there are consequences too. Anyone choosing to coast on the hard work of taxpayers will lose their benefits.

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Mel Stride, said:

We are rolling out the next generation of welfare reforms to help more people start, stay and succeed in work. We know the positive impact work can have, not just on our finances, but our health and wellbeing too.

So we are expanding the voluntary support for people with health conditions and disabilities, including our flagship Universal Support programme.

But our message is clear: if you are fit, if you refuse to work, if you are taking taxpayers for a ride – we will take your benefits away.

The plans announced today set out how the government will tackle long-term unemployment by supporting Universal Credit claimants to find work while strengthening work search requirements for job seekers through all stages of their Universal Credit claim. As a result of these reforms, no claimant should reach 18 months of unemployment in receipt of their full benefits if they have not taken every reasonable step to comply with Jobcentre support.

The plans to tackle long-term unemployment include:

Plans set out also include expanding key health and employment programmes, to benefit over half a million people over the next five years and help those with mental health conditions stay in or find work:

Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Victoria Atkins, said:

We know that tailored work and health support initiatives can help break down the kinds of barriers that can make finding and staying in a job more difficult for those with mental health conditions.

Backing them with further investment means they’re more widely available, enables personalised help and will get thousands back to work by overcoming any issues that may be preventing them from fulfilling their career potential.

Kate Shoesmith, Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) Deputy Chief Executive, said:

Today’s announcements will help the Restart scheme keep making a real difference to people’s work and life chances. It contributes to efforts to overcome our labour and skills shortages and to further growing our economy. Bringing public and private employment services together is vital to get people into work and not look back. Our own award-winning Restart scheme, which sees recruiters work with employability services provider Maximus, has helped place 1700 long-term unemployed people into work since 2021.

Over next 5 years the following policies will have increased spaces of:

Mr Cameron said:

I really want this to be a very active Government in making sure we deliver strong trade policies and strong trade outcomes…

There’s going to be a very big Government impetus behind this policy.

I don’t think promoting British trade is just something for the Government. I think it’s something all of business can help us with and that’s where business ambassadors come in.

I want you to sell Britain - British exports and Britain as a place for investment.

The PM announced the Coalition Government’s new business ambassadors in November last year.  They have a wealth of business experience and knowledge and will assist UK businesses to recognise and exploit business opportunities.

The meeting today follows a jobs and growth summit in Downing Street yesterday, in which leaders of some of Britain’s biggest firms came to discuss their plans to create thousands of new jobs.

There had been a discussion on the Health Bill, a discussion on employment and the labour market and a discussion of parliamentary business, including the AV Bill. The key message in regard to this was that Cabinet was clear and united that we would not be splitting the Bill.

Asked if the Government would delay the referendum rather than see the Bill being split, the PMS replied that he would not get into speculation about that.

Asked if the Government was still looking to get the Bill through intact and on time, the PMS said that that was still our intention. The PMS said the reason the Government had wanted the referendum on the 5th May was because the public would only have to go to the polling stations once and it would be much cheaper.

Put that the constituency part of the Bill could be split from the rest of the Bill, the PMS said that the Government’s programme was very clear and we would not be splitting the Bill.

Asked about the reasoning behind not splitting the Bill, the PMS said that it was the Government’s programme. It was right that the House of Lords should discuss Government policy, but it had taken more time over the Bill in Committee than the Commons had on the Bill overall.

When asked if the Government was prepared to enter into discussions or compromise on any of the minor points being discussed in the Lords, the PMS replied that we had a package we intended to implement.

Asked if the Government had a view on whether the Coalition Agreement had a similar or equal status to a party manifesto, the PMS said that that was a question for constitutional experts. The PMS added that the Salisbury Convention which gave guidance on not standing in the way of a manifesto was still only a convention.

Put that Lord Prescott had suggested that there was no democratic mandate to what the Government was proposing, the PMS said that the House of Lords had the right to review and comment on legislation. The PMS added that part of the Bill was intended to provide for a referendum that would allow the people to decide on voting reform and that a referendum was a democratic step.

On whether the Cabinet could bring in a ‘guillotine’ to force the Bill through, the PMS said that he was not an expert on the use of guillotines in the House of Lords, but he was not sure that it was a straightforward option in this case.

Asked if there was any discussion in Cabinet on Succession and the Act of Settlement, the PMS said that there wasn’t. When asked for a Government position on the Bill, the PMS replied that amending the Act of Settlement was a complex and difficult matter that required careful consideration. The Government accepted that the provisions in the Act of Settlement could be discriminatory. Discussions had started with those Commonwealth countries who would be directly affected by any change in the rules, and were continuing, but it would not be appropriate to release details at this stage.

On whether the use of the word ‘discriminatory’ referred to Catholics as well as sexual discrimination, the PMS said he believed it referred to both.

Asked about a possible torture inquiry, the PMS said that we had announced that there would be a torture inquiry, but there had been a couple of steps to get through before that could begin. One of these steps related to some police enquiries that were yet to be completed, so the Inquiry had not yet begun.

The PMS added that it would be a matter for Sir Peter Gibson and the Inquiry to decide what precisely they wanted to examine.

Asked whether the Prime Minister agreed with the Chairman of RBS that some bankers were paid too much, the PMS said that the Government had set out its position on bonuses.

Asked how happy the Prime Minister was with the way the Bank of England was conducting its policy of keeping inflation down, the PMS replied that the Prime Minister had commented on this last Sunday. Monetary policy was a matter for the Bank of England.

Put that the Deputy Prime Minister had said that the President of the Ivory Coast should ‘go and go now’, the PMS advised people to speak to the Foreign Office on the Government’s latest position on the Ivory Coast.",Funding for Apprenticeships and Work Experience Placements,Welfare,,id25_833

Asked whether the Prime Minister had received a letter from David Willetts and / or Michael Gove on the issue, he said that it was clear that some people had talked about the proposal of a privately-financed yacht for the Queen. He added that if anyone wished to discuss any of their proposals then the Prime Minister would be happy to hear them. He said that no public money would be spent on a yacht.

Asked whether Downing Street had spoken to Buckingham Palace about the government facilitating the purchase of a yacht, the PMOS reminded journalists that we did not give details of our discussions with the Palace. He said that if the government could support the process in some way, but not through public funds, then we would be open-minded about that. Asked if the Prime Minister had received a letter on the issue, he said that he would not go into detail of the Prime Minister’s correspondence. Asked again for the Prime Minister’s view, he repeated that he would be happy to discuss any proposals.

The PMOS was asked whether any public money might be spent on the running and security costs of a yacht, to which he replied that journalists were getting ahead of themselves; these were proposals. Asked whether a yacht had ever been discussed at Cabinet, he said not at one which he had attended. Asked whether there had been any discussions with private financiers, he said that there were a number of proposals around, but he would not be getting into a lot of detail or speculating about what might happen.

Asked whether the Prime Minister had written to Rear Admiral Bawtree, the PMOS said that he had already set out the government position and would not get into further detail about the process or correspondence. Asked why the PMOS wouldn’t comment given that this was a suggestion from a Cabinet member, he said that the government would react favourably to the issue, but that it was not a government proposal. He said again that if there was something that government could do to support the idea then we would look at it.

Asked whether a yacht would be sponsored by the financiers, he said that it was not a government proposal so journalists should not expect the government to be able to answer detailed questions about it. Asked whether the government would object to non-domiciles funding the yacht, he repeated that it was not a government proposal.

Asked whether the Diamond Jubilee would be over-shadowed by the Olympics, the PMOS said that both events were a great opportunity for the country to celebrate a very special and important year. Asked about plans for any Jubilee legacy, he said that Department for Culture, Media and Sport were leading government efforts on that process, in liaison with the Palace.

Asked whether what the Advocate General was saying was at odds with the Prime Minister’s view on Scotland, the PMOS replied that it was not - it was exactly in line with what we had published the previous Tuesday. Asked whether the Prime Minister would agree that the issue of legality cannot be used as a negotiating position, he said that this issue needed to be clarified, which was why the government was consulting on a referendum.

Asked whether to expect any other changes to the Welfare Bill, the PMOS said that there had been some small changes and that we were listening to people’s views. He said that we had set out proposals and would be taking them through Parliament.",Working together on banking reform and monetary policy,Monetary,,id25_834

Download: [Supporting youth employment](http://www.number10.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/support-youth-employment.pdf)","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street",12 May 2011,"It comes as over 100 large companies and tens of thousands of small companies around the country have responded to the Government’s call and pledged to offer work experience places.

In total the Government will provide funding for up to 250,000 more Apprenticeships over the next four years, and funding for 100,000 work placements over the next two years.

The nature and extent of the deep rooted youth unemployment problem in the UK, and the Government’s priorities in this area are set out in the paper to be published today “Supporting Youth Employment”.

Although the majority of young adults are either in work or in education, there are still almost 670,000 young people unemployed and not in full time study. The measures outlined in the paper are designed to ensure that young people have the opportunity to get work to support economic growth, to advance their career prospects and encourage social mobility and help fill some of the 500,000 vacancies currently in the job market.

To support the most vulnerable young people the Government will invest £60 million over the next three years and commit it to:

The Government is also announcing a wide-ranging package to ensure that young people have the skills needed to compete in the global economy through a range of measures to improve and support vocational training. These include:

We also welcome initiatives led by the private and voluntary sectors to inspire young people. For example whatsyourdestination.co.uk is an emerging web-based platform that will bring together into one place the full range of organisations who work with young people to inspire them about their future.  This is still at an early stage and we encourage everyone who works to inspire young people to get involved.

Prime Minister David Cameron said:

This is about more than getting our economy back on track. It’s about more than improving the jobless numbers. It’s about changing people’s lives. Showing our young people we believe in them and backing that faith with action.

It’s time to reverse the trend of rising youth unemployment that has held back our country for far too long and help our young people get the jobs on which their future - and ours - depends.

But government can’t act alone. We need employers who are prepared to give young people a go. So I’m delighted that over 100 large companies and tens of thousands of small and medium sized enterprises have already responded to our call for work experience placements so that tens of thousands of young people can take those vital first steps in experiencing the world of work.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said:

Too often in the past during tough times we have seen young people left behind or neglected. Youth unemployment means young men and women, who should be experiencing the most exciting time of their life, losing their confidence and wasting their talents.

We all have a responsibility; government, business, charities, education providers - to work together to find a solution. Our young people have enormous potential and enthusiasm. We have to do whatever we can to help them aspire to be happy and successful, and look to the future with hope.

That is why I am delighted today to be announcing so many real opportunities. A record number of apprenticeships to give young people a solid career grounding and much wider access to apprenticeships for young people from different backgrounds.

We talk a lot about the future - about economic recovery and restoring prosperity. But we will have failed if we do not give all young people the chance to benefit and prosper.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said:

This package of measures will address the scandal of the highest level of youth unemployment the UK has seen in modern times. The key to tackling this is to give young people experience in work through placements, apprenticeships and guaranteed training.

Alongside it will be the Work Programme. Where young people who are unemployed will be given the intensive support and help they need to take up that job opportunity when it becomes available. The only route to a sustained reduction in poverty is through helping young people into work, not leaving them to a life on benefits.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said:

Providing young people with every opportunity to gain skills is vital for fuelling economic growth and fostering social mobility. Reducing bureaucracy for businesses that want to take on Apprentices is one more way we are helping our young people to achieve their potential and be part of the skilled workforce of the future.”

Employment Minister Chris Grayling said:

Tackling youth unemployment is one of the Government’s top priorities. We’ve lined up thousands of employers to provide work experience places for young unemployed people. We’ve launched tens of thousands of new apprenticeships. And now our new sector based work academies will offer a new dimension to the support on offer by combining real training, work experience and a guaranteed interview which will give young people another platform to get into a job. We’re determined to make sure our young people have a brighter future.

Skills Minister John Hayes said:

The Government is delivering at least 250,000 more Apprenticeships over the next 4 years. We are committed to improving the Apprenticeship programme, expanding it to give more young people the skills to drive growth, building a vocational pathway to prosperity. Our new Access to Apprenticeship scheme will help up to 10,000 unemployed young people gain new skills, secure Apprenticeships and make a better future for themselves and Britain.

The Government’s five priorities for action for supporting youth employment, and tackling some of the long term structural problems are to:

The Government is supporting jobseekers through allowing them to undertake work experience for up to eight weeks while still claiming out-of-work benefits. This started in January and has been extended nationally to all 18-24 year olds. From October 2011 an extension of 12 weeks work experience will be available where an employer is willing to offer an Apprenticeship to the young person.

Companies offering these work experience places and Apprenticeships include Serco who are committed to provide 1000 new work experience places for young people and 500 apprenticeships in 2011 across the UK; Tesco who are committing 3000 work experience places; and, KFC who are looking to provide 3,000 to 5,000 Apprenticeships a year at every level across the business. Other companies supporting this include IBM, Wates, ASDA, Park Resorts, Siemens, Orange, McDonalds, Marks and Spencer, Arcadia and BT.

The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister are writing to FTSE 100 companies, and a number of major privately owned companies, and major multinationals listed abroad but operating in the UK calling on them to play their part and take more action to support youth employment, in particular through further support for the Apprenticeship scheme.",Pakistan-UK Trade and Investment Roadmap,Informational,,id25_835

The sanctions against MEC will be enforced immediately for its involvement in serious human rights violations by making funds available to the military, as well as its association with senior military figures. Designating MEC will  prohibit funds and economic resources being made available to any subsidiaries ‘owned or controlled’ by MEC as defined by the Global Human Rights sanctions regime.

The sanctions come as the Foreign Secretary also announces extra funding today to bolster a mechanism to collect, investigate and preserve evidence of serious human rights violations in Myanmar. The UK is contributing half a million pounds to the ‘Independent Investigative Mechanism’ for Myanmar (IIMM) to increase evidence gathering capabilities, which may in future be used in criminal proceedings.

The ‘Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar’ was established by the UN Human Rights Council to collect and preserve evidence of serious human rights violations in Myanmar. The Open Source Investigation work will ensure that reporting on social media and elsewhere is identified and verified for use in future criminal proceedings, to hold to account those who are responsible for the killing and oppression of the people of Myanmar.

Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, said:

Two months on from the start of the coup, the Myanmar military has sunk to a new low with the wanton killing of innocent people, including children.

The UK’s latest actions target one of the military’s key funding streams and impose a further cost on them for their violations of human rights.

The designation of MEC is in response to credible evidence that it has contributed funds to support the Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw who have committed serious human rights violations across the country, and that MEC is associated with senior military officers. The MEC Board of Directors is mainly comprised of serving or retired military personnel, including Chiefs of Staff of the Army, Navy and Air Force and the former Quartermaster General.

The asset freeze imposed by the sanctions prevents anyone from dealing with funds or economic resources which are owned or controlled by the sanctioned individual or organisation. It also prevents others from providing funds or economic resources, directly or indirectly, to or for the benefit of the sanctioned individual or entity – in this case MEC.

As permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, NATO Allies, European Union members, and Nuclear Weapons States, we share many common interests and responsibilities. We are proud of our outstanding and experienced armed forces and our advanced defence industries.

We are determined to act as leaders in security and defence. Security and prosperity are indivisible. That is why, between us, we invest half of the defence budget of European nations and two thirds of the research and technology spending. We are among the most active contributors to operations in Afghanistan and in other crises areas around the world. We are equally among the few nations able and ready to fulfil the most demanding military missions. Today, we have reached a level of mutual confidence unprecedented in our history.

Together we face new challenges such as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles, terrorism, cyber attacks, maritime and space security. We must be ready to prevent, deter, defend against and counter those threats. More than ever, we need defence capabilities that are robust, can be rapidly deployed and are able to operate together and with a range of allies

In addition, a threat to our vital interests could also emerge at any time. We do not see situations arising in which the vital interests of either nation could be threatened without the vital interests of the other also being threatened.

Today, we have decided to intensify our co-operation still further. We want to enable our forces to operate together, to maximise our capabilities and to obtain greater value for money from our investment in defence. We plan to increase the range and ambition of our joint defence equipment programmes, and to foster closer industrial co-operation.

We believe this co-operation will benefit all our Allies and contribute to the security of the Atlantic Alliance, the European Union and our friends overseas.

a) to sign a Defence & Security Co-operation Treaty to develop co-operation between our Armed Forces, the sharing and pooling of materials and equipment including through mutual interdependence, the building of joint facilities, mutual access to each other’s defence markets, and industrial and technological co-operation;

b) to collaborate in the technology associated with nuclear stockpile stewardship in support of our respective independent nuclear deterrent capabilities, in full compliance with our international obligations, through unprecedented co-operation at a new joint facility at Valduc in France that will model performance of our nuclear warheads and materials to ensure long-term viability, security and safety - this will be supported by a joint Technology Development Centre at Aldermaston in the UK;

c) to sign a Letter of Intent, creating a new framework for exchanges between our Armed Forces on operational matters;

d) to direct the UK-France High Level Working Group to strengthen its work on industrial and armament cooperation; and

e) to pursue joint initiatives in the areas detailed below

Operations and training

Combined Joint Expeditionary Force. We will develop a Combined Joint Expeditionary Force suitable for a wide range of scenarios, up to and including high intensity operations. It will involve all three Services: there will be a land component comprised of formations at national brigade level, maritime and air components with their associated Headquarters, and logistics and support functions. It will not involve standing forces but will be available at notice for bilateral, NATO, European Union, United Nations or other operations. We will begin with combined air and land exercises during 2011 and will develop the concept before the next UK-France Summit and progress towards full capability in subsequent years. The Force will stimulate greater interoperability and coherence in military doctrine, training and equipment requirements.

Aircraft carriers. The UK has decided to install catapults and arresting gear to its future operational aircraft carrier. This will create opportunities for UK and French aircraft to operate off carriers from both countries. Building primarily on maritime task group co-operation around the French carrier Charles de Gaulle, the UK and France will aim to have, by the early 2020s, the ability to deploy a UK-French integrated carrier strike group incorporating assets owned by both countries. This will ensure that the Royal Navy and the French Navy will work in the closest co-ordination over the next generation.

Equipment and capabilities

A400M support. We are developing a common support plan for our future fleets of A400M transport aircraft. This will reduce costs, improve spares availability and open the way for further co-operation in maintenance, logistics and training, for both deployed and home-based operations. We are in the final stages of negotiations with industry to agree a single contract with Airbus Military, which is to be signed by the end of 2011 so that integrated support is in place for the arrival of the first French aircraft in 2013.

A400M training. We will establish a bilateral Joint User Group to facilitate co-operation on the development of A400M training to inform operating techniques and procedures as well as exploring opportunities for synthetic and live training.

Submarine technologies and systems. We plan to develop jointly some of the equipment and technologies for the next generation of nuclear submarines. To that end, we will launch a joint study and agree arrangements in 2011. Co-operation will help to sustain and rationalise our combined industrial base and will also generate savings through the sharing of development activities, procurement methods and technical expertise.

Maritime mine countermeasures. We will align plans for elements of mine countermeasures equipment and systems. This could provide efficiencies, ensure interoperability and help sustain the Franco-British industrial base in the underwater sector. We will therefore establish a common project team in 2011 to agree the specifications for a prototype mine countermeasures system.

Satellite communications. We will assess the potential for co-operation on future military satellite communications, with a view to reducing overall costs while preserving national sovereignty. We aim to complete a joint concept study in 2011 for the next satellites to enter into service between 2018 and 2022.

Air to air refuelling and passenger air transport. We are currently investigating the potential to use spare capacity that may be available in the UK’s Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA) programme to meet the needs of France for air to air refuelling and military air transport, provided it is financially acceptable to both nations.

Unmanned air systems

Unmanned Air Systems have become essential to our armed forces. We have agreed to work together on the next generation of Medium Altitude Long Endurance Unmanned Air Surveillance Systems. Co-operation will enable the potential sharing of development, support and training costs, and ensure that our forces can work together. We will launch a jointly funded, competitive assessment phase in 2011, with a view to new equipment delivery between 2015and 2020.

In the longer term, we will jointly assess requirements and options for the next generation of Unmanned Combat Air Systems from 2030 onwards. Building on work already started under the direction of the UK-France High Level Working Group, we will develop over the next two years a joint technological and industrial roadmap. This could lead to a decision in 2012 to launch a joint Technology and Operational Demonstration programme from 2013 to 2018.

Counter-terrorism

NATO

NATO remains the fundamental guarantor of Europe’s security. We share the same objectives for the forthcoming NATO Summit in Lisbon. In particular, we are looking for major decisions on reform to ensure NATO’s efficiency and effectiveness. We also want a new Strategic Concept that: makes clear NATO’s continuing commitment to collective territorial defence and to addressing threats to Allies’ security wherever they stem from; addresses new threats to Allies’ fundamental security interests; and underlines NATO’s desire to work with a wide range of partners. In this context, we will pursue closer co-operation across the board between NATO and the EU, and a lasting partnership between NATO and Russia based on practical co-operation and reciprocity.

As long as nuclear weapons exist, NATO will remain a nuclear alliance. British and French independent strategic nuclear forces, which have a deterrent value of their own, contribute to overall deterrence and therefore to Allies’ security. These national minimum nuclear deterrents are necessary to deter threats to our vital interests. We will support a decision in Lisbon on territorial missile defence, based on the expansion of the ALTBMD system, which is financially realistic, coherent with the level of the threat arising from the Middle East, and allows for a partnership with Russia. Missile defence is a complement to deterrence, not a substitute.

European Union

We continue to support the objectives and full implementation of decisions taken by the December 2008 European Council, under the French EU Presidency. In particular we encourage all European Union members to develop their military, civilian, and civilian-military capabilities, so that European countries can become more effective at delivering security and responding to crises.

European Union operations off the coast of Somalia and in Georgia, Bosnia and Kosovo contribute to the overall security of NATO Allies. We will encourage closer co-operation and complementarity between the EU and NATO. We look forward to further progress by the end of 2011 and will work with the Belgian, Hungarian and Polish EU Presidencies to that end.

As part the UK’s support for the clearance of the Calais camp, 769 unaccompanied children were transferred from France to the UK. 549 of these children were transferred to reunite with family members already in the UK.

However, some of the children do not qualify for international protection under existing immigration rules, but the government is clear that all those transferred from Calais to reunite with their family members should be able to remain here and that is why a new form of leave will be created.

Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said:

We can be proud of our record of helping refugee and other vulnerable children affected by conflict, violence and instability, since the start of 2010 we have provided asylum or an alternative form of protection to over 31,000 children.

I am determined that we continue in these efforts and that is why we are introducing a new form of leave, exclusively for children brought to the UK from the Calais camp, so that they can continue rebuilding their lives with their families in the UK.

Calais Leave will grant those who qualify the right to study, work, access public funds and healthcare, and apply for settlement after ten years.

It will only be available to those brought over as part of the Calais clearance exercise between October 2016 and July 2017, who were under the age of 18 at this time, and who had recognised family ties in the UK.

External site:UK-Pakistan investment Roadmap

The UK and Pakistan enjoy uniquely rich people-to-people links and growing cultural exchange.  The close personal connections between our citizens are just one of the many distinctive characteristics in UK - Pakistan relations.

To mark Prime Minister Gilani’s visit to the UK at the invitation of Prime Minister Cameron, the governments of the UK and Pakistan have detailed the vibrant links between school children, students, young professionals, cultural institutions and higher education sectors.  These activities and many more, contribute to the unbreakable partnership between the UK and Pakistan.  This visit provides an opportunity to celebrate those connections.

The governments of the UK and Pakistan are committed to supporting growing people-to-people links and cultural exchange through the Enhanced Strategic Dialogue which has been in operation for 12 months.

Bringing children together

The British Council is bringing school children in the UK and Pakistan together through its Connecting Classrooms project.  150 schools in Pakistan are linked with 90 schools in the UK.  These partnerships bring an international dimension to young people’s learning, improve their knowledge and understanding of other cultures, and prepare them for life and work as global citizens.  The programme creates a more connected world for the future and better understanding. Internationalism and dialogue between cultures are at the heart of all activities. It also develops leadership skills for education professionals and training for teachers to enhance their classroom skills.

Children in Pakistan are also benefiting from the UK’s commitment to create an international sports legacy in the year it hosts the Olympic and Paralympic Games.  The International Inspirations programme in Pakistan: creates partnerships between schools; supports a national curriculum for physical education (PE); and provides protective environments to encourage sports participation for girls and for young people living with disabilities. The aspiration is for at least one million children and young people in Pakistan to have access to high-quality and inclusive PE and sport. There are links between 38 Pakistani schools and 20 specialist sports-schools in the UK.

Connecting Classrooms, International Inspirations and the Global School Partnership are programmes with a long-term vision. Plans are in place to sustain and develop the work that they do.

The Connecting Classrooms programme will grow in 2012-15, as a partnership between the British Council and DFID.  Some 90 school links have been built between Pakistan and the UK through the DFID Global School Partnership, focussing on development education.

Pakistan endorses the DFID/British Council school programme 2012-15 which will build school-to-school partnerships and extend school leaders’ & teachers’ skills.

As part of the International Inspirations programme, a 14 year old Karachi schoolgirl will be one of the people carrying the Olympic Flame on its 70-day journey around the UK this summer. Two more young people (from Multan and Karachi) will volunteer in the UK School Games in London as ‘young leaders of tomorrow’.

Bringing higher education and students together

“Pakistan’s transition to a middle income economy is critically dependent on the scale and performance of its tertiary education sector.  Institutions of higher learning must play a leadership role in this transition” (Pakistan’s Higher Education Commission). The British Council’s INSPIRE  ‘leadership programme’ has trained 87% of Pakistan’s Vice Chancellors and Rectors, drawing on the UK’s considerable strengths in higher-education leadership skills. The Knowledge Exchange programme has developed universities’ new roles in economic and social development in Pakistan.

The British Council has worked with 128 of Pakistan’s 132 universities over the last few years, initiating research and capacity-building links between Pakistani and UK universities, and built almost 100 university links:

• HEC and British Council: 50 research and capacity-building links between universities (HEC £3.5m, 4 years); 27 INSPIRE strategic university partnerships (BC £0.9m, HEC £1.2m, 6 years)• UK Prime Minister’s Initiative: 10 university-to-university links (£0.9m, 2 years)• DFID: 7 Delphe south-south and UK university partnerships that contribute to development and 3 health-research & advocacy links

Some 11,000 Pakistanis studied in the UK in 2010-11 and a further 35,000 studied in Pakistan for degrees or professional awards with UK higher education providers.  Each year, some 200,000 young Pakistanis present for 400,000 UK examinations.

The Chevening Scholarship programme has sent over 1,000 Pakistani students to study in the UK, since its launch in 1983.  The Charles Wallace Trust Fellowship and similar schemes made 52 Fellowship awards for 2011 and 2012.

Senior Pakistani journalists are currently in the UK on a special programme with the University of Westminster.

In the immediate future, the INSPIRE programme will continue into mentoring partnerships between Vice Chancellors in the UK and Pakistan.  A next-generation leadership programme will extend training to the second tier of management at universities.

Pakistan’s Higher Education Commission and the British Council will jointly invest £1.3m in an 18 month programme to continue developing strategic university partnerships.Pakistan endorses the Higher Education Commission and British Council joint investment in Pakistan-UK higher education links and university leadership training.

The number of Pakistani students studying with the UK continues to grow.   The UK is now a preferred choice for university linkages and research programmes. Faculty members of Pakistani universities are doing PhDs under split-site arrangements and joint research publications are increasing. There are to be 22 new Chevening scholarships awarded in 2012.

The British Pakistan Foundation has formed a network of young professionals in the UK who are all committed to supporting Pakistan’s development.

The British Council helps connect Pakistani students with UK universities and with employers in Pakistan. The Corporate Initiative attracted 17 Pakistani employers to careers fairs at UK universities in 2012 to recruit top talent for Pakistani jobs.  The UK alumni networks in Pakistan keep long-term links with graduates and make new connections.

Pakistan wants to improve the employability of its young people.  The British Council Enterprise Awards develop the entrepreneurial skills of young people in Pakistan’s vocational sector, putting innovative ideas into action. The shortlisted teams get mentoring by Peter Jones Academy students and other UK-based enterprise academies.  Training material was created by Enterprise UK.

To increase relevance, UK expertise assisted the formation of new industry advisory groups (IAG) in Pakistan, similar to the UK Sector Skills Councils. The Pakistan National Vocational & Technical Training Commission has now expanded these to more industry sectors. The British Council hosted the first ever international conference on Employer Engagement and Entrepreneurship for the TVET Sector in Pakistan, this year.  The British Council has invested in 5 college-to-college capacity building partnerships between Pakistan and the UK, resulting in 55 new TVET modules and 40 exchanges.

The IAG’s have created 23 trade standards, an aim of which is raising the quality and relevance of vocational training for young Pakistanis. The longer term aim here is to provide support and skills for the future workforce of Pakistan, to enable them to compete globally.##Bringing our cultural institutions together

New partnerships between cultural institutions are being formed, including with the British Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum.

The Edinburgh Culture Summit will be attended by Ministers for culture from more than 30 countries, following their attendance at the 2012 Olympics. The summit’s objective is to use ‘culture as an international dialogue’. Pakistan intends to attend the summit.

The UK has been celebrating traditional Pakistani truck art.  Students in Luton were able to learn from Pakistani artists to paint a truck which has been on tour around the UK.  National College of Art Students in Pakistan painted their school bus to celebrate the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

The British Council facilitated Pakistan school pupils and artists at the Alchemy Festival of UK and South Asian cultures in the South Bank, London in 2012.

Pakistan will be represented in the UK Cultural Olympiad.  Lahore-based Wallay Theatre is bringing an Urdu production of Shakespeare’s Taming of the Shrew to London’s Globe Theatre in May 2012.  On the same weekend, London will welcome Pakistan’s top fashion designers for Pakistan Fashion Week.",Flood Action Campaign,Informational,Other,id25_841

The warning follows a pattern of severe flooding over the past 10 years linked to an increase in extreme weather events as the country’s climate changes. Met Office records show that since 1910 there have been 17 record breaking rainfall months or seasons – with 9 of them since 2000. As intense storms are becoming more frequent, sea levels are also rising because of climate change.

The Environment Agency has today launched itsFlood Action Campaign, targeting younger people through social media and online advertising to encourage them to check their flood risk at GOV.UK, sign up for free warnings and be prepared to take action when flooding hits. Research shows that 18 to 34 year olds are least likely to perceive flood risk to their area, know how to protect their homes or where to go for information. They are also at highest risk of fatality as they are less likely to perceive their personal risk.

Sir James Bevan, Chief Executive of the Environment Agency, said:

Climate change is likely to mean more frequent and intense flooding. Floods destroy – lives, livelihoods, and property.

Our flood defences reduce the risk of flooding, and our flood warnings help keep communities safe when it threatens. But we can never entirely eliminate the risk of flooding. Checking your flood risk is the first step to protecting yourself, your loved ones and your home.

In summer 2012, the lengthy period of drought the country had experienced came to an abrupt end when prolonged and intense rainfall increased the risk of flooding from rivers and surface water for long periods. Almost 8,000 homes and businesses were flooded across the country, particularly in the south west.

The winter of 2013 to 2014 started with a coastal surge and record sea levels on the north and east coasts. This was followed by 12 storms in succession and became the wettest winter for 250 years – 11,000 homes were flooded.

Winter 2015 to 2016 brought widespread flooding to 17,000 properties across the north of England, with named storms Desmond, Eva and Frank causing December 2015 to be the wettest month ever recorded.

The threat of flooding is real and increasing – as is also demonstrated by its listing as one of thenation’s major threats.

Last year, the Met Office published new innovative research which found that for England and Wales there is a 1 in 3 chance of a new monthly rainfall record in at least one region each winter.

By their very nature extreme events are rare and a novel research method was needed to quantify the risk of extreme rainfall within the current climate.

Professor Adam Scaife, who leads this area of research at the Met Office, said:

“The Met Office supercomputer was used to simulate thousands of possible winters, some of them much more extreme than we’ve yet witnessed. This gave many more extreme events than have happened in the real world, helping us work out how severe things could get.”",Calls for diplomats to become 'economic ambassadors for Britain',Informational,,id25_843

The PM said:

Our troops have performed magnificently in Sangin and I pay tribute to the thousands who have served, to the over one hundred who have given their lives, to the many who have been wounded.

They did not die in vain. They made Afghanistan a safer place and they have made Britain a safer place and they will never be forgotten.

The transfer of authority, first announced by the Defence Secretary in July this year, is the last move in the current rebalancing of ISAF forces across Helmand.

Mr Cameron said the Government should be “messianic” in wanting to see free trade and open markets across the world and urged a “big step change in our approach to foreign and diplomatic relations in massively upgrading the importance of trade”.

The PM told the summit in central London that as well as pushing far harder on trade to attract inward investment, the Government was focusing on dealing with the deficit and wanted to make the country more business-friendly.

He said:

What we are discussing today is probably the most important subject facing this country because we are coming out of a very deep and difficult recession, growth is fragile, and it is absolutely vital for our country that we attract the maximum amount of inward investment and that we do everything we can to demonstrate that the British economy is open for business, open for trade, open for investment.

Earlier this month, Mr Cameron spoke to diplomats from the Foreign Office and called on them to use their skills and contacts to become “economic ambassadors for Britain” to help build our export-led growth.

Figures today show an ever-growing bill to the NHS which currently stands at £2.7bn a year, including £1bn on accident and emergency services. £2.7bn equates to £90 for every taxpayer. This is part of a wider cost to society from alcohol of between £17 billion and £22 billion per annum.

In 2010/11 alone there were 200,000 hospital admissions with a primary alcohol-related diagnosis, 40 per cent higher than in 2002/03. The number of patients admitted with acute intoxification has more than doubled to 18,500 since 2002/03.

Ahead of the visit the Prime Minister said:

Every night, in town centres, hospitals and police stations across the country, people have to cope with the consequences of alcohol abuse. And the problem is getting worse. Over the last decade we’ve seen a frightening growth in the number of people - many under-age - who think it’s acceptable for people to get drunk in public in ways that wreck lives, spread fear and increase crime.

This is one of the scandals of our society and I am determined to deal with it. As figures today show the NHS is having to pick up an ever-growing bill - £2.7bn a year, including £1bn on accident and emergency services alone. That’s money we have to spend because of the reckless behaviour of an irresponsible minority.

Across the country local hospitals, ambulance crews and the police are rising to the challenge. We must help them to do so and will be setting out how through the forthcoming Alcohol Strategy. Whether it’s the police officers in A&E that have been deployed in some hospitals, the booze buses in Soho and Norwich, or the Drunk Tanks used abroad, we need innovative solutions to confront the rising tide of unacceptable behaviour.

This isn’t just about more rules and regulation. It’s about responsibility and a sense of respect for others.

Asked if the Prime Minister was sympathetic to complaints regarding the act, the PMS said that bribery should play no part in winning investment or business, and we stood by all the other OECD countries that had similar anti-bribery laws.  Clearly we wanted to be business friendly: the aim of the growth review was to ensure that we tried to remove obstacles for investment, but at the same time ensure that we didn’t promote activities we didn’t abide by, such as bribery.

Asked if the date of the referendum would be moved if the AV Bill didn’t get through in time, the PMS said that we were committed to the date of the referendum, and we were confident the bill would get through.

Asked if the Prime Minister had a message for tanker drivers considering strike action, the PMS said that this industrial action was a matter for the particular unions and drivers involved.  More generally, we wanted any strike action that caused disruption to be avoided.

Asked if there was anyway the Government could act to cut fuel duty before the Budget, the PMS said that tax decisions were a matter for the Chancellor at the time of the Budget, but the Prime Minister had made clear that he was understanding of the suffering of motorists at this time, and had asked the Treasury to look at what could be done.",Creation of a new Olympics Legacy unit in the Cabinet Office,Institutional,,id25_848

Leaders at the conference agreed to continue with NATO operations, bring those guilty of war crimes to justice and to support the National Transitional Council to achieve political transition.

Speaking following the meeting, Mr Cameron said that although “enormous difficulties” lay ahead the Libyans were showing the world their courage, spirit and resilience and said the NATO operation in Libya would continue for “as long as we are needed to protect civilian life”.

Some people thought that chaos would start the moment the regime fell so what we are seeing emerging now in Libya, despite the years of repression and the trauma of recent days and months, is immensely impressive.

Enormous difficulties lie ahead of course but the Libyans are showing the world their courage, their spirit and their resilience.

International leaders at the conference, held in the Elysee Palace, unanimously agreed the need to hand over frozen Libyan assets to the NTC.

Speaking earlier today, the PM stressed that the conference was all about “backing the NTC in the work they want to do”.

This is a Libyan-owned, Libyan-led process.  The international community are there to help, there to give assistance, there to give advice, but the action and the plan is being drawn up and carried out by the Libyans, and that’s right.”

Under the doctrine of state multiculturalism, we have encouraged different cultures to live separate lives, apart from each other and the mainstream.

We have failed to provide a vision of society to which they feel they want to belong.

We have even tolerated these segregated communities behaving in ways that run counter to our values.

… I believe it’s time to turn the page on the failed policies of the past.

So first, instead of ignoring this extremist ideology, we - as governments and societies - have got to confront it, in all its forms.

And second, instead of encouraging people to live apart, we need a clear sense of shared national identity, open to everyone.

Mr Hinds also confirmed the nine areas across the country that will trial new high-quality mental health assessments for young people entering care, helping them get the support they need to meet their individual needs at a time when they are more vulnerable.

Education Secretary Damian Hinds said:

As a society, we are much more open about our mental health than ever before, but the modern world has brought new pressures for children, while potentially making others worse.

Schools and teachers don’t have all the answers, nor could they, but we know they can play a special role which is why we have launched one of the biggest mental health trials in schools. These trials are key to improving our understanding of how practical, simple advice can help young people cope with the pressures they face.

To support this, we’re introducing compulsory health education in all schools, within which children will start to be introduced gradually to issues around mental health, wellbeing and happiness right from the start of primary school.

We are rolling out significant additional resources to schools to improve mental health provision at an earlier stage through the Government’s Green Paper proposals, including awareness of ‘mental health first aid’ techniques and teams of trained mental health staff to work with and in schools.

Led by the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families in partnership with University College London, the school study is now in its second wave and recruiting more primary and secondary schools to join.

The trials are designed to explore the impact of different approaches at school, in recognition of the significant time children spend at school and the important role teachers can play in recognising changes in pupils’ behaviour or mood.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said:

I want to see all children and young people have the opportunity to flourish – and protecting their mental health is vital to this.

I’m incredibly excited by this initiative, which will help young people better understand their mental health and identify when they need to ask for help sooner.

To explore what works in schools to support young people’s mental wellbeing, the trials will test five different approaches. These include:

The mental health assessment pilots, also run by the Anna Freud Centre, will look at providing improved mental health assessments for children entering the care system. Currently an estimated half of all children in care meet the criteria for a possible mental health disorder, compared to one in ten children outside the care system, so these pilots – backed by £1 million announced last year - will identify the mental health and broader wellbeing needs of these children, including whether a referral to a more specialist service is needed.

The areas include two of the Government’s Opportunity Areas Doncaster and the North Yorkshire Coast, where the programme will examine which professionals should be involved in the assessment and develop best practice that ensures every child’s individual needs are at the centre of the process.

Dr Jessica Deighton from the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families said:

We know schools have a strong commitment to supporting children’s mental health and wellbeing but have had little clear guidance about the best ways to approach this. We want children and young people, parents and teachers to be confident that mental health in schools has an absolutely robust evidence base.

This world leading research which, we at the Anna Freud Centre are proud to be leading, will provide that and has the potential to transform mental health promotion in schools across England. We also need to better identify the mental health needs of the most vulnerable children in society, particularly children in the care system, and an improved mental health framework will greatly help.

The announcements build on the Government’s wider investment in support for children’s mental health in schools, including bringing in specialist support teams with the mental health trailblazers programme, to ensure every young person is given the tools to thrive despite challenges they may face growing up.

Catherine Roche, Place2Be CEO said:

We welcome these trials in continuing to build an evidence base of effective ways to make a real difference to children’s mental health. We know from Place2Be’s work in schools across the UK the importance of working not only with children and young people, but in partnership with teachers, parents, and the wider community to promote mental health and life-long resilience.

Action for Children’s director of policy and campaigns, Imran Hussain, said:

Every day our frontline services see children and teenagers struggling to get to grips with how they fit into the increasingly complex modern world - contending with things like intense pressure at school, bullying or problems at home, all while being bombarded by social media.

It’s really encouraging to see the Government taking action to tackle the children’s mental health crisis by trialling different approaches in schools. We know from our own school programmes how vital it is to step in early with support to stop problems in their tracks. Crucially, services like these can lessen the anxiety, pain and anguish that some teens go through, but also reduce their need for intensive support further down the line.",Creation of a Big Society Bank,Institutional,,id25_858

This is the first time that a UK government has taken decisions on its defence, security, intelligence, resilience, development and foreign affairs capabilities in the round, setting out the delivery of the ends set out in the National Security Strategy.

Strategic Defence and Security Review - Securing Britain in an Age of Uncertainty.

It follows the National Security Strategy, published yesterday, and sets out the government’s determination to make the right decisions for the long term defence and prosperity of the country.

Speaking to military personnel earlier today, the PM admitted that some “incredibly difficult” decisions had been made in preparation for theSDSR.

In a statement to Parliament, Mr Cameron said:

There is no cut whatsoever in the support for our forces in Afghanistan … Furthermore, every time the chiefs of defence staff have advised me that a particular change might have implications for our operations in Afghanistan, either now or in the years to come, I have heeded that advice.

In fact, we have been and will be providing for our brave forces in Afghanistan: more equipment to counter the threat from IEDs; more protected vehicles - like the warthog heavy protection vehicle which will be out there by the end of the year; more surveillance capability, including unmanned aircraft systems; and crucially, at last, the right level of helicopter capability.”

Mr Cameron said:

It’s time for something different, something bold - something that doesn’t just pour money down the throat of wasteful, top-down government schemes.

The Big Society is that something different and bold.

It’s about saying if we want real change for the long-term, we need people to come together and work together - because we’re all in this together.

Mr Cameron also announced the creation of a Big Society Bank which will be financed using dormant bank and building society account money.

These unclaimed assets, alongside the private sector investment that we will leverage, will mean that the Big Society Bank will - over time - make available hundreds of millions of pounds of new finance to some of our most dynamic social organisations.

Attending the event were representatives from four “vanguard” communities which the government will help to create ‘beta’ versions on the Big Society.

These communities will become the great training grounds where the Big Society will be built with officials from the Department of Communities and Local Government assisting them.

The 2024 calendar for the UK’s Emissions Trading Scheme will limit the number of carbon allowances for companies to buy in 2024 to 69 million – 12.4% fewer than in 2023, and their lowest-ever level. By 2027, this will fall to around 44 million – a 45% reduction on 2023 - before reaching around 24 million by 2030.

It putsplans announced earlier this yearinto action - to reduce the cap on carbon emissions under the Emissions Trading Scheme in line with the UK’s ambitious net zero strategy.

Through the scheme’s auctions process, companies in industries including manufacturing, power and aviation are required to buy allowances for every unit of carbon they emit. With fewer available to buy, these sectors will need to take further steps to cut their emissions.

The auction calendar published today by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), on behalf of the UK Emissions Trading Scheme Authority, gives businesses certainty over the next 12 months and sets the scheme on a clear path for decarbonisation for the 6 years after that.

In a joint statement, UK Emissions Trading Scheme Authority ministers, including Lord Callanan, Julie JamesMS, Màiri McAllanMSPand Exchequer Secretary Gareth DaviesMPsaid:

We want to give our industries the confidence to decarbonise, by investing in efficiency measures and moving away from fossil fuels to cleaner, more secure energy.

The UK Emissions Trading Scheme will cut supply of allowances auctioned, with a 45% reduction by 2027, to help us on our path to net zero.

The auction calendar for 2024 and introduction of the new net zero consistent cap will help provide certainty for businesses, while spurring investment and helping to grow the economy.

To ease the transition to a net zero cap, a proportion of allowances that went unused between 2021 and 2023 are now being allocated to auctions to be held between 2024 and 2027 – helping taper the reductions needed over that time. The number of allowances auctioned will still fall significantly each year over this period. There are also programmes in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland providing millions of pounds to help businesses make the changes needed.

As part of wider changes to the scheme, the UK Emissions Trading Scheme Authority has also committed to exploring measures for the future of the carbon allowances market, including examining the merits of a supply adjustment mechanism. This would provide a means of amending the supply of carbon allowances in response to market conditions.

A copy of the 2024 UK Emissions Trading Scheme auction calendar can be found on theICEwebsite.ICErun UK Emissions Trading Scheme auctions and secondary markets on behalf of the government.

The UK Emissions Trading Scheme Authority is the joint body comprising the UK government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland that runs the scheme.

The UK Emissions Trading Scheme Authority Ministers quoted are:

On 3 July, the UK Emissions Trading Scheme Authority announced an ambitiouspackage of reforms to the UK Emissions Trading Scheme. At the heart of this was resetting the scheme’s cap in line with the net zero strategy, reducing it from 1,366MtCO2eover the phase from 2021 to 2030 to 936MtCO2e– a 30% reduction. Today’s auction calendar publication is a key step in making this tighter limit a reality.

In 2024, the total number of carbon allowances available for auction will be 69 million.  The 69 million allowances that will be available in 2024 amounts to a 12.4% reduction year-on-year, compared to nearly 79 million allowances auctioned in 2023.

Further reductions in auction supply will be made in each subsequent year - by 2027 this will amount to a 45% decrease, before reaching around 24 million by 2030. More information on the carbon allowance cap reduction is available in theUK Emissions Trading Scheme Authority’s consultation response, published in July 2023.

This is a key aspect of the series of reforms the government is making across the detention system in response to Stephen Shaw’s second review into the welfare of vulnerable people in detention, published a year ago.

The reforms include promoting and encouraging voluntary return and introducing a pilot to support vulnerable women outside detention while their cases are resolved. Practical changes have also been made to Immigration Removal Centres, such as reducing the number of beds and rolling out the use of Skype.

The reforms have meant that there is a higher ratio of staff to detainees in removal centres and there has been a more than 30% reduction in the number of people in detention.

Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said:

I am committed to going further and faster in reforming immigration detention.

Over the past year we have reduced the number of detainees, improved detention decision-making and bolstered the safeguards in place to protect the vulnerable.

We have put in place the foundations that will enable us to continue the changes Stephen Shaw envisaged last year and I will continue to ensure that the health and wellbeing of detainees is the number one priority.

I know there is more to do and I’m committed to making real change so we have detention and removal policies which are fair and humane for everyone.

In addition, we are piloting automatic bail referral of detainees to the First-Tier Tribunal of the Immigration and Asylum Chamber after 2 months in detention. The pilot is due to conclude in August.

We have also increased face-to-face engagement with detainees. There are new engagement teams in the removal centres improving induction and links between detainees and their caseworkers. This also supports the management of detainees’ wellbeing and the identification of any signs of mental or physical deterioration.

Last July, the former Prisons and Probation Ombudsman for England and Wales, Stephen Shaw, published a report which assessed government progress in responding to his 2016 review on the welfare of vulnerable individual in detention.

863,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-confirms-move-to-plan-b-in-england,Press release,Prime Minister confirms move to Plan B in England,Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced a move to Plan B in England.,"Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson",8 December 2021,"The Prime Minister has today [Wednesday 8 December] confirmed that England will move to Plan B following the rapid spread of the Omicron variant in the UK.

Urgent work has been ongoing to understand the impact of the new variant with regards to vaccines, treatments and transmissibility. Early indications showed a large number of concerning spike protein mutations as well as mutations in other parts of the viral genome.

On Saturday 27 November, the government acted quickly to slow the spread of Omicron while more data was collected and assessed.

The most recent data suggests that Omicron has a very high growth rate and is spreading rapidly. S-gene drop out cases have grown from 0.15% of cases during the week of 21st November, to 3.3% of cases since 5 December in England. There are currently 568 cases confirmed across the UK and early analysis from the UK Health Security Agency suggesting the doubling time could be as little as 2.5 to 3 days.

As seen in previous waves, a swift rise in cases can lead to a rapid rise in hospitalisations, which will quickly lead to pressure on the NHS. The data in South Africa is showing a rapid increase in hospitalisations.

As a result of this concerning data the Prime Minister has acted quickly and with caution, confirming Plan B measures will come into force while more data on vaccine efficacy and disease severity is assessed. Plan B was set out in September and will help to slow the spread of the variant and reduce the chances of the NHS coming under unsustainable pressure, while buying time to deliver more boosters.

While it is likely there is some level of reduced vaccine effectiveness against Omicron, it is still too early to determine the extent of this.

The government will continue to look closely at all the emerging data but vaccines remain our best line of defence and it is now more vital than ever that those who are unvaccinated come forward, and those eligible for their boosters book when called.

Today the NHS confirmed a huge expansion of the booster programme, with the National Booking Service now open to all those aged over 40 to book their jabs. The dose interval has also been shortened from six months to three months, with those eligible now able to book a month in advance – two months after their second dose.

The vaccine programme will be supported by the continued development of world-leading treatments. Today the Prime Minister confirmed a new national study that will see 10,000 UK patients at risk of serious illness from COVID-19 given the treatment molnupiravir to treat their symptoms at home.

Testing will also be a vital tool in controlling the spread given the likely increased transmissibility of Omicron. As there is now demonstrated community transmission of Omicron, we intend to introduce daily contact tests for contacts of confirmed positive cases instead of the ten-day self-isolation period.

Everyone should test using a lateral flow device, particularly before entering a high-risk setting involving people you wouldn’t normally come into contact with, or when visiting a vulnerable person. Lateral flow devices remain free of charge and can be collected from local pharmacies.

From Friday 10 December, face coverings will become compulsory in most public indoor venues, such as cinemas, theatres and places of worship. There will be exemptions in venues where it is not practical to wear one, such as when you are eating, drinking or exercising. For that reason, face masks will not be required in hospitality settings.

From Monday 13 December, those who can will be advised to work from home.

From Wednesday 15 December, and subject to parliamentary approval, the NHS Covid Pass on the NHS App will become mandatory for entry into nightclubs and settings where large crowds gather – including unseated indoor events with 500 or more attendees, unseated outdoor events with 4,000 or more attendees and any event with 10,000 or more attendees.

People will be able to demonstrate proof of two vaccine doses via the app. Having considered the evidence since the emergence of Omicron, proof of a negative lateral flow test will also be accepted.

Introducing Covid-status certification from next Wednesday will give businesses a week’s notice, as promised in the government’s proposals for introducing mandatory certification published in September.

A full list of guidance on these changes will be available on gov.uk in the coming days. Face covering regulations will be laid in parliament tomorrow, with the remaining regulations laid on Monday 13 December.

Parliament will debate the measures next week, with a vote expected to take place on Tuesday 14 December.

The government will keep the data under constant review. The regulations set to expire six weeks after implementation, with a review after three weeks.

Taken together, the government is hopeful these measures will reduce transmission and slow the spread of the Omicron variant, and will continue to urge those eligible to get their boosters when called.",Suspension of enforcement of gender pay gap deadlines,Administrative,,id25_863

The CMA’s statement comes in response to concerns that the CMA could intervene to stop these types of collaborations under competition law.

Combination therapies combine two or more individual drugs into one treatment and have become increasingly important to treat a range of serious conditions, most commonly cancers. They can provide better health outcomes than individual drugs because, in combination, these drugs can target the disease more effectively.

These combination therapies can only be approved for use on the NHS if they are shown to be ‘cost effective’. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) told the CMA that, since 2017, half of the combination therapies for cancer treatments involving branded drugs, submitted for assessment to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), have withdrawn from the process entirely or were assessed not to be cost effective.

In some cases, a combination will only be ‘cost effective’ and commercially feasible if there is some form of co-operation between drug firms, and businesses have raised concerns that such co-operation might be investigated by the CMA. Therefore, the CMA is playing its part by clarifying where and how competing drug firms can work together to give them more chance of meeting the cost effectiveness threshold and getting these vital drugs to market.

The CMA has worked closely with the ABPI, NHS England (NHSE), and NICE to deliver this public statement, and engaged with relevant bodies in all 4 nations of the UK to help ensure patients can benefit, wherever they are based. By complying with the conditions outlined in the CMA’s statement, drug firms will be able to negotiate a commercial agreement with the comfort that the CMA will not prioritise this conduct for investigation. However, the information exchanged between drug firms must be limited to what is strictly necessary to reach the commercial agreement, and drug firms cannot share the confidential price of their individual drugs.

Ann Pope, CMA Senior Director of Antitrust, said:

Tens of thousands of NHS patients are missing out on innovative combination therapies. Concerns from competing drug firms that they’ll fall foul of competition law for working together is not the only reason why more of these therapies aren’t available to NHS patients, but the CMA is playing its part by explaining how firms can negotiate and avoid being investigated.

Our statement is designed to provide clarity and comfort to firms who follow the rules, ultimately aiming at more people being able to access vital treatments. It is not a ‘free pass’, and any companies engaging in anti-competitive behaviour will continue to be robustly investigated by the CMA.

Fiona Bride, Director for Medicines Value & Access at NHS England, said:

NHS patients are already benefiting from access to combination cancer therapies, but it’s clear that industry concerns about competition law may act as a barrier to a wider range of combination treatments reaching patients that could benefit.

This vital step by the CMA now provides a clear position that commercial deals involving multiple medicines licensed by different companies can be agreed, under specific circumstances, so that NHS patients can benefit from the latest combination therapies for a range of conditions at a fair price to taxpayers.

Helen Knight, Director of Medicines Evaluation at NICE, said:

NICE is seeing an increasing number of combination therapies coming through its health technology assessment pipeline, so it has been important for us to support the CMA in delivering this statement.

We believe that allowing companies to engage with each other in these very specific circumstances will increase the opportunity for these therapies to progress through NICE evaluation. This has the potential to get better treatments to patients, faster.

As well as the benefits to patients that come from having more combination therapies available on the NHS, there are wider benefits for growth and innovation in the pharmaceutical sector. More companies should have the confidence to invest in and bring combination therapies to market, ultimately achieving greater value for money for the NHS.

Semaglutide and liraglutide are prescription only medicines.

Saxenda (liraglutide), is authorised in the UK for weight loss, with diet and exercise. Ozempic (semaglutide) has been authorised for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes, also with diet and exercise. It is not authorised for weight loss, but it is used off-label for that purpose.

The MHRA has seized 369 potentially fake Ozempic pens since January 2023, and has also received reports of fake Saxenda pens that have been obtained by members of the public in the UK through non-legitimate routes (any route that does not require a prescription from a qualified prescribing healthcare professional). None were seized before January 2023.

Buying prescription-only medicines online without a prescription poses a direct danger to health. The MHRA has received reports of a very small number of people who have been hospitalised after using potentially fake pens.

With any medicines bought outside of the legal supply chain, the contents may not match the ingredients on the label. Serious side effects reported of those hospitalised, including hypoglycaemic shock and coma, indicate that the pens may contain insulin rather than semaglutide.

If anyone has a concern about their health, they should visit their GP or pharmacist, get a correct diagnosis and if medicines are prescribed, obtain them from a legitimate source.

All pharmacies in Great Britain, including those online, must be registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC)and meet their standards for registered pharmacies.

Dr Alison Cave, MHRA Chief Safety Officer said:

“Buying products such as Ozempic or Saxenda without a prescription, from illegally trading suppliers, significantly increases the risk of receiving something which is either fake or not licensed for use in the UK.

Products purchased in this way do not meet our strict quality and safety standards, and taking such medicines may put your health at significant risk.

“We are advising all members of the public not to use any pre-filled weight loss pens they may have bought online and instead to report it to us so that we can investigate and take any necessary action.

“If you suspect that you’ve had a side effect to semaglutide, liraglutide or any other medicine, or suspect it’s not a genuine product, you can report it to ourYellow Card scheme.”

Health Minister Will Quince said:

“No one should put profit before the needs of patients, but fraudsters selling black market medicines like this are extremely dangerous and can put people’s health at risk.

“The medical advice is clear: patients should only use medicines like Ozempic or Saxenda where they’ve been prescribed it by a legitimate source, such as their GP or another legitimate prescriber.

“The MHRA have our full support in cracking down on these illegal online suppliers to ensure that patients are protected.”

Professor Paul Gately, CEO of Obesity UK, said:

“We at Obesity UK are very concerned to hear reports that people living with obesity are falling victim to criminals who are obtaining and selling fake weight loss medication.

“The dangers to health are clear. Our advice, like that of the MHRA, is that only medication prescribed by a qualified medical/healthcare professional should be taken.

MHRA safety advice when buying medicines online

Be careful when buying medicines online

Medicines are not ordinary consumer goods and their sale and supply is tightly controlled. Websites operating outside the legal supply chain may seem tempting, for example, offering a prescription medicine without a prescription. Not only are these sites breaking the law – they’re putting your health at risk.

Criminals use a variety of techniques to sell medicines illegally online. Some are sold using websites designed to look like legitimate pharmacies or online retailers, while others might be advertised via online marketplaces or social media sites.

Visit the #FakeMeds websitefor tools and resources to help people purchase medicines or medical devices safely online.

Semaglutide and liraglutide are examples of GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists, medicines that are used to treat type 2 diabetes and help manage weight. They are available as injections, often referred to as pens or jabs.

Off-label prescribing is when a product is prescribed for use outside the terms of its licensed use, including for a different indication and/or to a different patient population. As stated in MHRA guidance, this is allowed in “clinical situations when the use of unlicensed medicines or use of licensed medicines outside the terms of the licence (i.e. ‘off-label’) may be judged by the prescriber to be in the best interest of the patient on the basis of available evidence”. In these situations, the prescriber has additional responsibilities regarding information to the patient and recording treatment (see GMC guidelines).

If a product is captured under the definition of a “medicinal product” contained within the Human Medicines Regulations 2012, it must hold a Marketing Authorisation to be legally sold or supplied in UK.

The MHRA continuously works with national and international partners to prevent fake medicines from entering the UK. Its#FakeMeds campaignprovides quick and easy tools to help the general public avoid fake and substandard medical products.

TheYellow Card schemeenables the MHRA to monitor safety concerns such as suspected side effects or adverse incidents involving healthcare products. These include medicines, vaccines, blood factors and immunoglobulin products, medical devices, e-cigarettes and complementary therapies such as homeopathies. The scheme also collates information about suspected safety concerns involving defective, falsified or fake healthcare products. Anyone can report defective or fake healthcare products to the Yellow Card scheme via the Yellow Card scheme website or app.

The scheme has succeeded in creating a mature market for ultra-low emission vehicles, helping to increase the sales of fully electric cars from less than 1,000 in 2011 to almost 100,000 in the first 5 months of 2022 alone.

Battery and hybrid electric vehicles (EVs) now make up more than half of all new cars sold and fully electric car sales have risen by 70% in the last year, now representing 1 in 6 new cars joining UK roads.

The government has always been clear the plug-in car grant was temporary and previously confirmed funding until 2022-23. Successive reductions in the size of the grant, and the number of models it covers, have had little effect on rapidly accelerating sales or on the continuously growing range of models being manufactured.

Due to this, the government is now refocusing funding towards the main barriers to theEVtransition, including public charging and supporting the purchase of other road vehicles where the switch to electric requires further development.

To continue the government’s drive towards net zero and ensure effective use of taxpayer funds, £300 million in grant funding will now be refocused towards extending plug-in grants to boost sales of plug-intaxis,motorcycles,vans and trucksandwheelchair accessible vehicles, as announced in theautumn statement.

The shift in focus will also help allow government funding to target expanding the public chargepoint network, helping to eradicate “range anxiety” and ensure the transition to zero-emission transport is easy and convenient for all drivers across the UK. The government has alreadycommitted £1.6 billion to building the UK’s public chargepoint network.

Significant savings in running costs for electric cars compared to petrol or diesel equivalents can often exceed the current £1,500 value of the grant, and electric car drivers will continue to benefit from generous incentives including zero road tax and favourable company car tax rates, which can save drivers over £2,000 a year.

All existing applications for the grant will continue to be honoured and where a car has been sold in the 2 working days before the announcement, but an application for the grant from dealerships has not yet been made, the sale will also still qualify for the grant.

Transport Minister Trudy Harrison said:

The government continues to invest record amounts in the transition toEVs, with £2.5 billion injected since 2020, and has set the most ambitious phase-out dates for new diesel and petrol sales of any major country. But government funding must always be invested where it has the highest impact if that success story is to continue.

Having successfully kickstarted the electric car market, we now want to use plug-in grants to match that success across other vehicle types, from taxis to delivery vans and everything in between, to help make the switch to zero emission travel cheaper and easier.

With billions of both government and industry investment continuing to be pumped into the UK’s electric revolution, the sale of electric vehicles is soaring.

We are continuing to lead the way in decarbonising transport, with generous government incentives still in place, while creating high-skilled jobs and cleaner air across the UK.

The government’s measures to support the uptake of electric cars over the past decade have helped to exceed electric car projections, with 39,000 newEVregistrations in March 2022 – more than in the whole of 2019. Since its inception in 2011, the government’s plug-in car grant has provided over £1.4 billion and supported the purchase of nearly half a million clean vehicles.

A newpublic evaluation reporthas been published today highlighting while the plug-in car grant was vital in building the early market for electric vehicles, it has since been having less of an effect on demand, with other existing price incentives such as company car tax, continuing to have an important impact. The report also found the plug-in van market will benefit from grant incentives more to support businesses and their fleets in making the switch.

While benefitting from significantly lower running and refuelling costs – as low as 2p per mile,EVdrivers can also expect to see a surge in cheaper, more reliable and quicker public chargepoints, as the government delivers its commitment to install 10 times more on-street chargers by 2030.

Since 2020, the government has committed £2.5 billion to plug-in vehicle grants, infrastructure and the wider transition to electric vehicles in the UK.  The industry is further boosting the switch to greener vehicles by expanding its range of more affordable zero emission cars. A total of 24 models are currently priced under £32,000, compared to just 15 a year ago, and the cost of monthly purchase and rental schemes has fallen significantly.

This includes requests from pupils for ‘social transition’ which can include requests to change pronouns, names, and uniform.

In response to the complex phenomenon of the increasing number of children questioning their gender, the government has taken the time to carefully and robustly address the challenges and issues involved.

The guidance will assist teachers in ensuring that they are acting in the best interests of children.

Education Secretary, Gillian Keegan said:

This guidance puts the best interests of all children first, removing any confusion about the protections that must be in place for biological sex and single-sex spaces, and making clear that safety and safeguarding for all children must always be schools’ primary concern.

Parents’ views must also be at the heart of all decisions made about their children – and nowhere is that more important than with decisions that can have significant effects on a child’s life for years to come.

Minister for Women and Equalities, Kemi Badenoch said:

This guidance is intended to give teachers and school leaders greater confidence when dealing with an issue that has been hijacked by activists misrepresenting the law.

It makes clear that schools do not have to accept a child’s request to socially transition, and that teachers or pupils should not be pressured into using different pronouns.

We are also clear how vital it is that parents are informed and involved in the decisions that impact their children’s lives.

Ofsted Chief Inspector, Amanda Spielman

I have long called for clear guidance for schools who face difficult choices around how to help pupils who are gender-questioning.

This guidance is therefore welcome and will help schools do their best both for gender-questioning pupils and for all other pupils in their schools.

This guidance has been developed with the expert clinical view and interim conclusions from the Cass Review in mind. That review set out that social transition is not a neutral act, and that better information is needed about the outcomes for children who undertake degrees of social transition. It also set out that it could have significant psychological effects on a young person.

In recognition of this, proper use of this guidance means social transition, in practice, should be extremely rare when the appropriate safeguards are put in place and the child’s best interest taken into account.

Importantly, the guidance places beyond doubt the fundamental principle that parents should be involved in decisions about their children’s lives, and that significant decisions affecting a child’s future should not be taken without parents being involved.

In regard to single-sex spaces and sports, the government sets out the principle that biological sex is fundamentally important when it comes to protecting safety and ensuring fairness in competitive sports.

The draft guidance clarifies that schools and colleges do not have to, and should not, accept all requests for social transition. Where a school considers a request, they should take a very cautious approach, including watchful waiting periods, and ensuring parents are fully consulted before any decision is taken.

From the outset, schools and colleges should also consider the context and seriousness of the request including whether social influence is involved.

In exceptional cases where a request to social transition is agreed, children, teachers or staff at a school should not be required to adopt the use of preferred pronouns and there must be no sanction, verbal or otherwise. Where a teacher or child does not adopt the new pronouns, they should use the child’s preferred name. Schools should ensure that bullying is never tolerated.

Where safety is a consideration – for example in physical sport or single-sex spaces – the guidance is categoric that it must never be compromised by allowing a child of the opposite sex to participate in those activities or use those facilities. Schools should also make sure competitive sport is fair, which will almost always mean separate sports for boys and girls especially in older cohorts.

The guidance also reaffirms that single-sex schools can refuse to admit pupils of the opposite sex, regardless of whether they are questioning their gender.

Parents, teachers, and school leaders are encouraged to respond to the 12-week consultation.

The guidance provides clarity on how to approach a range of issues when it comes to supporting gender questioning children and responding to requests for changes known as ‘social transition’.

872,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-investment-in-peat-in-fight-against-climate-change,Press release,New investment in peat in fight against climate change,"On 29 June 2023, the government announced new investment and actions to improve lowland peat and reduce carbon emissions.","Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, Environment Agency, Natural England and Trudy Harrison",29 June 2023,"New investment and actions to improve lowland peat and reduce carbon emissions have been set out by the government today (Thursday 29 June).

Peat soils contain over half the country’s terrestrial carbon stores and serve as a potent nature-based solution against climate change. However, as a result of centuries of drainage to create land suitable for agriculture, our peat soils are drying out, causing the organic matter they contain to decompose and release carbon into the atmosphere. Today, just 1% of England’s lowland peatlands remain in a near-natural state.

By rewetting lowland peat soils, we can deliver carbon emission reductions, improve food security, boost wetland biodiversity, and better protect communities from flooding.

To support the preservation and sustainable management of lowland peatlands, the government has announced that it willtake forward action on all the recommendations made by Robert Caudwell, independent Chair of the Lowland Agricultural Peat Task Force, whose report is published today.

Our peatlands are invaluable allies in our battle against climate change, housing over half of our terrestrial carbon stores and providing resilience for future farming.

These new measures, which includes funding for innovative new water management schemes, bolster our efforts to protect and improve peat soils – enhancing carbon storage, preserving vital ecosystems, and paving the way for a more sustainable future.

This comes alongside over £7.5 million of new funding to kickstart improvements in how we manage water resources to rewet and preserve peat soils. This funding will drive advancements in our understanding of the lowland peat water challenge to transform the way we use water in England’s lowland peat, and will also pay for the installation of infrastructure and monitoring technology to enable more control of water levels in these regions.

The measures government is taking will also improve resilience to drought and safeguard productive farming on some of our most valuable agricultural land, supporting our rural economy and those whose livelihoods are intrinsically tied to the land.

In 2020, the government established the Lowland Agricultural Peat Task Force to explore how to improve the condition of England’s lowland farmed peat whilst ensuring the continuation of productive agriculture for years to come.The Chair of the task force has put forward fourteen recommendationsto government and the wider sector to ensure that lowland peat soils can be managed more sustainably.

These recommendations include:

I thank all the members of the Lowland Agricultural Peat Task Force for their time and commitment to finding ways of managing lowland agricultural peat that are sustainable and substantially reduce carbon emissions.

All the evidence demonstrates that reducing carbon emissions from lowland peat is vital as part of the United Kingdom government’s plan to tackle climate change.

The report and the U.K. government’s response are important first steps in a journey that will require partnership between all stakeholders, and I am confident that the work that is already underway will give farmers opportunities to develop their businesses and contribute to the challenge of net zero.

The new funding is distributed across two pilots.  The Lowland Agricultural Peat Small Infrastructure Pilot (£5.45m) will support the installation of infrastructure and monitoring technology to enable more control of water levels for the preservation and rewetting of lowland peat. Delivery of this project is being supported by the Association of Drainage Authorities.

The Lowland Agricultural Peat Water Discovery Pilot (£2.2m), to be delivered by the Environment Agency, will allow local and water peatland partnerships to collaborate to develop costed water level management plans for lowland peat areas in England.

The Environment Agency welcomes the publication of the Caudwell report. Drawing on the report’s recommendations, we recognise that the sustainable management of the water environment through raising the water table within peat soils holds a pivotal role in protecting the carbon it stores.

The report findings combined with further research and development provide useful support and incentives to farmers looking to transition to more climate friendly farming of peat soils. This is set out in our National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy for England and Roadmap.

Twelve projects across England are also set to receive support through the £5 million Paludiculture Exploration Fund grant scheme - administered by Natural England - to help understand and overcome barriers to developing paludiculture as a commercially viable farming practice on lowland peat soils.

Lowland peatlands play an important role in combating climate change, by keeping carbon in the land and out of the air. Working with land managers and others, it is imperative we find ways to support livelihoods and produce what society needs while at the same time halting the degradation of peat soils.

This is why I am so delighted that the £5 million Paludiculture Exploration Fund grant scheme will support twelve projects aimed at overcoming obstacles to developing economically viable farming on wet peat soils. This promising form of wetland agriculture holds tremendous potential for both revitalising peatlands and supporting profitable and sustainable rural businesses.

Today’s announcements are part of the government’s commitments to drive international ambition on action to tackle climate change and work towards nature-based solutions, and demonstrate our ambition to deliver on our net zero pathway.

The evidence generated by the projects will enable Defra to deliver on our lowland peat commitments within the government’s England Peat Action Plan, Net Zero Strategy, Environmental Improvement Plan, and Plan for Water. On lowland peat, Defra has already funded a new update to the Peatland Code, announced a £6.6m peatland research and development programme, and is developing new farming schemes to support rewetting, restoration and new farming methods in the lowlands. It will also be publishing the new England Peat Map next year.

In recognition of the environmental benefits and the key role lowland peat soils play in food production, the government will continue to work with the Chair of the task force as well as farmers, landowners and the wider industry to take forward action on all the report’s recommendations for more sustainable forms of peatland management.

Robert Caudwell was chair of the Lowland Agricultural Peat Task Force – a group that was tasked with improving the condition of England’s farmed lowland peat. The task force ran between 2021 and 2022. It comprised a national group and four regional sub-groups, which advised on the circumstances of our most extensive lowland peatlands spanning North-East, North-West, South-West and East England. The Task Force was also supported by a sub-group composed of experts in paludiculture.

Membership of the Task Force was as follows:

Funding: £2.2 million

Details: The Lowland Agricultural Peat Water Discovery Pilot, delivered by the Environment Agency, will help to improve Defra’s understanding of how water can be better managed to support the rewetting and preservation of lowland peatlands. The project will allow partnerships to collaborate locally to develop costed water level management plans for lowland peat areas in England.

Funding: £5.45 million

Details: The Lowland Agricultural Peat Small Infrastructure Pilot will support the installation of infrastructure and monitoring technology, which will enable more control of water levels for the preservation and rewetting of lowland peat. Delivery of this project is being supported by the Association of Drainage Authorities.

In addition to these projects, Defra is planning to support a research and development programme over the next two years with the Environment Agency to investigate questions around rewetting peat, such as water demand, supply and storage; water-management structures; flood-risk management; nature-based solutions for water quality; biodiversity and regulation.

This project forms part of the £6.6 million Lowland Peat Research and Development Programme, and will explore further the options, feasibility and wider impacts of managing lowland agricultural peat for reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

The work will focus on water availability and distribution to rewet lowlands; impact of topography on rewetting; impacts and risks of more sustainable management practices; and implications on national food supplies.

More information is available on theLowland Peat Project 3 page.

Following a Defra funded research report on greenhouse gas data and emissions factors, the IUCN UK Peatland Programme launched an update to the Peatland Code in March 2023, which allowed lowland fen peatland to be included for the first time. The Peatland Code helps to promote the restoration and protection of peatlands in the UK through attracting private finance.

The Peatland Code allows landowners with eligible peatlands to generate carbon units which can be sold to companies seeking to offset their residual carbon emissions.

Paludiculture, or farming on rewetted peat, is a system of agriculture for the profitable production of wetland crops under conditions that support the competitive advantage of these crops. It offers an opportunity to continue profitable agriculture on lowland peat while also managing the land in a way that benefits the environment and supports our net zero ambitions.

The £5m Paludiculture Exploration Fund grant scheme application window was open from January 2023 to March 2023. Natural England are today announcing the twelve projects across England which have been successful in securing grants to support the reduction of barriers to developing commercially viable paludiculture on lowland peat soils.

Below is a list and brief description of the projects that this fund is supporting. The projects will explore:

·

You can find follow these projects and other developments in paludiculture atwww.paludiculture.org.uk

The project will look at existing use of drones and explore potential new areas of use for drones in paludiculture scenarios. The project will focus on various potential crop management tasks as well as the use of drones to monitor crop health. The project will also explore the environmental impact of drone use.

The project aims to ‘unlock paludiculture’ through several outcomes. Through feasibility discussions with farmers, it will identify areas in the Broads most suited to wetland crops. In a strategic alliance it will promote and provide a demonstration of paludiculture fibre products to farmers in the region. To promote paludiculture sourced materials in developing consumer and construction products and explore new market opportunities for paludiculture products.

The project will use willow to produce a sustainable, renewable product whilst protecting and preserving the peat on West Sedgemoor. Utilising hundreds of years of expertise and knowledge of willow and the land, the project will research and develop new science and technology for more efficient planting, with lower herbicide use, and improved harvesting practises and develop a high value product to provide sustainability to farming businesses.

Explore a viable land use on multiple pockets of land across the Somerset Levels & Moors (SL&M), overcoming economic and cultural barriers to raising water levels across hydrological blocks of peat. Provide an income stream for owners of the lowest-lying fields, enabling water tables to be raised in higher/drier fields and reducing CO2 emissions without expensive hydrological engineering works.

Explore paludiculture to improve water quality, specifically by reducing phosphate pollution levels within SSSI and Ramsar protected sites. To assess if paludiculture can play a role in supporting ecological diversity of the SL&M through targeted use within the landscape.

The project will work with farmers to build on work the group has already completed in an NCPGS discovery project. Creating and ground truthing detailed peat maps. Supporting these maps with productivity and water management opportunity data. Implementing hydrological modelling of the landscape to monitor water table fluctuation along with CO2 & CH4 emissions.

Research and development into the practical field preparation; water management and associated infrastructure needed to establish paludiculture crops. Demonstrated on the university site to use as an educational facility as well as building knowledge around the cropping techniques. Assessment of machinery requirements and opportunities. Collecting data on the above outcomes as well as social impact and value modelling to establish best practice, relevance, and barriers to paludiculture among the farming community.

The focus of the project is to develop understanding of the economics, practical issues, and environmental uplift of commercial Typha growing at field scale. Many practical aspects of growing crops on wet soil conditions will be explored from sowing through to management and harvesting. Adapting current mechanised processes and exploring new ones through farmer led experience. In support of this other food crops will be grown at trial scale to explore these opportunities.

OPENpeat will define and demonstrate the future role of paludiculture in a conservation and ecosystem services focussed landscape. Sharing best practice from existing and emerging paludiculture trials in UK and EU through direct farmer engagement and promote peer to peer learning between UK farmers. During the project period, activities including interviews and workshops aim to embed paludiculture discussion and willingness of farmers on lowland peat to experiment with paludiculture.

The project will scale up the production of Sphagnum Farming to produce sustainable growing media to replace peat and support the English horticulture sector, whilst also supporting lowland peat farmers with this sustainable, profitable Sphagnum crop for their land. The project will create a commercially sustainable demonstration farm and overcome identified barriers throughout the supply chain.

To develop and scale up the process of seed separation for Saltyco’s patented BioPuff product. To explore the potential to use these seeds as planting source for new crop establishment. In addition to this, new uses and products will be explored for the Typha seeds to add further value to this paludiculture crop.

The project aims to build on and expand trials of incorporating biochar in peat soils. Biochar is a charcoal-like product following the pyrolysis of biomass feedstocks under low oxygen conditions. Being high in carbon (>70%) and relatively stable, it is viewed as a form of carbon capture but may also improve other functions in soil and deliver other agronomic benefits. In this way, biochar has the potential to be an additional income stream for farmers considering paludiculture.

The overall goal and vision for this project is to overcome the variety of barriers to paludiculture. The grant will explore the options that need to be considered to produce a business case. On production of the business case a small-scale trial site will explore a recommended paludiculture option.",Competition to identify the headquarters for Great British Railways,Institutional,Other,id25_872

While agriculture is vital for global food security and rural livelihoods, it is also a key driver of climate change and nature loss. Farmers on the front line of climate change suffer ever more frequent, severe weather impacts, including drought and floods.

Improving soil health, land management and efficient use of fertiliser are some of the changes the Just Rural Transition Support Programme will work with climate vulnerable partner countries to adopt so their agriculture policies are more productive and sustainable.

The UK will also provide £10 million through the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) to help smallholder farmers and others improve their incomes in ways which reduce the impact on the natural world, particularly forests.

Climate change and deforestation mean that countries like Zambia are suffering droughts, which negatively affect their economies and food production. One example of how the programme will help is by supporting smallholder farmers in Zambia – many of whom are women in rural communities – to expand their businesses, by growing new crops, or improving the quality of their produce, linking them to export markets and planting trees to create more sustainable sources of raw materials.

These announcements follow on from last month’sUK hosted Global Food Security Summit, which brought together countries and international organisations to galvanise support for lasting solutions to prevent famine, wider food insecurity and malnutrition.

Today at COP28, the focus is also on water alongside food and agriculture. Agriculture accounts for 70% of freshwater use globally and causes 70% of water pollution. With the world facing an unprecedented and accelerating water crisis, rapid action is needed to ensure sustainable access to clean water. By 2030, it is estimated there will be a 40% shortfall in freshwater supply, with drastic consequences for people, planet and nature. Growing water insecurity, accelerated by climate change, is rapidly undermining the achievement of all the Sustainable Development Goals.

At the climate summit, Minister Mitchell will set out up to £39 million new funding for the newly launched Just Transitions for Water Security programme, to help countries manage water resources responsibly for the future.

The Just Transitions for Water Security programme will provide technical assistance to low-income and climate vulnerable countries so they can better manage their water resources. This in turn will strengthen climate resilience for the most vulnerable, support more sustainable food systems and improve drought and flood management, all while making sure everyone has access to clean water.

The programme will also help countries work towards water security and mobilise much-needed investment in water, such as large-scale rainwater harvesting.

International Development and Africa Minister Andrew Mitchell said:

Water is at the centre of the climate crisis. Water security must be driven up the global agenda.

My message is clear: we must protect water properly if we are to ensure equitable access for all. UK funding set out today will support water resilient supply chains, and boost investments to ensure this basic and vital source of life is available to vulnerable communities on the frontline of climate change.

Part of the Just Transitions for Water Security programme involves the Resilient Water Accelerator, led by WaterAid, which aims to boost investment in water systems.

Chief Executive of WaterAid Tim Wainwright said:

The climate crisis is a water crisis, with communities in low and middle income countries struggling daily with too little, too much, or too dirty water. WaterAid welcomes the UK government connecting the drops between climate change and water, committing at COP28 to invest up to £39 million into global water security.

WaterAid is happy to be supporting the Resilient Water Accelerator in unlocking private investment at pace. We hope other nations will join the UK in supporting adaptation projects that will build life-saving sustainable, climate-resilient water resources and services.

At COP28 the UK has also signed up to the Freshwater Challenge – launched at the UN Water Conference in March this year by the governments of Colombia, DR Congo, Ecuador, Gabon, Mexico and Zambia – to boost the restoration and conservation of freshwater ecosystems, recognising the essential role these habitats play in tackling climate change and supporting people and nature.

Last month as part of therecently published International Development White Paper, the UK committed to establish a cross-government global water security strategy that sets out the UK’s work on water security in the context of climate change and ensures coherence across sectors in water-related policy making.

These announcements demonstrate the UK’s commitment to deliver the objectives of the Emirates Declaration on Sustainable Agriculture, Resilient Food Systems and Climate Action. The UK was one of the first countries to endorse the declaration at the Global Food Security Summit last month and it is now supported by more than 130 countries.

The Global Commission on the Economics of Water estimated in its reportTurning the Tide (PDF, 9.5 MB)that by 2030 there will be a 40% shortfall in freshwater supply, with drastic consequences for people, planet and nature.

The White Paper onInternational development in a contested world: ending extreme poverty and tackling climate changewas published in November 2023.

The competition will recognise towns and cities with a rich railway history that are strongly linked to the network ensuring the first headquarters will take pride of place at the heart of a new era for Britain’s railways.

The Transport Secretary also announced today the creation of theGBRTransition Team under the leadership of Andrew Haines, who will continue to work asCEOof Network Rail.

The Transition Team will now be responsible for driving forward reforms and creating the railway’s new guiding mind. They will initially focus on driving revenue recovery efforts post-pandemic, bringing a whole industry approach to tackling cost and promoting efficiency and establishing a strategic freight unit to boost the sector.

The Transport Secretary has also set out the core goals that will defineGBR, including:

GBRwas commissioned in May 2021 as part of theWilliams-Shapps Plan for Rail, focused on delivering sweeping reforms that create a truly passenger-focused railway.

875,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/25-million-boost-for-nurse-training,Press release,£25 million boost for nurse training,"Nurses and other healthcare students will benefit from expanded virtual training, and the launch of a new national critical care qualification for qualified nurses.",Department of Health and Social Care,17 March 2021,"The government has announced a £25 million boost for nurse training which will see nurses and other healthcare students benefit from expanded virtual training, and the launch of a new national critical care qualification for qualified nurses.

Up to £15 million of the funding will go to universities to invest in new simulated training facilities and technology. This can involve the use of virtual reality (VR) technology, manikins, role play, and smart phones, tablets or computers, allowing nursing students to practise their clinical skills in a safe environment. They will be able to train themselves on clinical procedures and simulate a realistic clinical setting with the support from experienced colleagues.

It comes after the Nursing and Midwifery Council announced up to 300 of the 2,300 clinical practice hours nurses need to complete during their degree can now be completed in simulated environments, due to the pandemic.

Alongside this, the government will also invest £10 million to develop a new, nationally recognised, critical care qualification for qualified nurses, which can also be accessed by a number of Allied Health professions. This will be rolled out for immediate use during the pandemic to help boost the number of people able to work in critical care.

Minister for Care Helen Whately said:

We are committed to training more nurses for the NHS and supporting professional development, and this £25 million investment will provide more innovative training opportunities for nurses.

Whilst there is no substitute for face to face training on wards, simulated training is a vital part of the curriculum and provides a safe space for students to develop their skills. Thanks to our investment, more nursing and other healthcare students will be able to benefit from the latest innovations and new technologies to better support their learning at this time.

The funding will also recognise our critical care nurses, who have played a crucial role during this pandemic, with a new nationally recognised qualification.

Professor Mark Radford, Chief Nurse, Health Education England said:

We welcome this support on simulation hours from theNMCin support of students, which will build on universities’ existing expertise in the education of healthcare workers for the NHS and social care. During the COVID pandemic, we recognise and very much value the massive contribution of our students and universities, along with all NHS staff. This further investment will directly support students to further their studies and qualify.

Working with critical care organisations, we have rapidly designed new innovative education options to provide additional support to the NHS. It’s vital that we look for as many diverse and flexible routes into training as possible, and this announcement will help make the most of the technology available to support nurses on that journey.

Dr Katerina Kolyva, Executive Director of the Council, said:

The COVID crisis has put unprecedented pressure on practice placement capacity for students. Many universities have responded by increasing student exposure to simulated experiences. The most up to date technology offers some amazing opportunities for learning but is also expensive. We appreciate the flexibility shown by professional regulators over the past year, which has allowed universities to use simulation more creatively on some courses.

This new investment will go some way to helping universities provide the equipment and facilities necessary to take advantage of this flexibility. Over time sustained investment in infrastructure and staffing would allow the nation to educate more nurses, midwives and allied health professionals for the health and social care sector.

Matthew McClelland, Executive Director of Strategy and Insight at the Nursing and Midwifery Council, said:

We’re committed to supporting our students and professionals during the challenges and workforce pressures posed by the pandemic.

That’s why we introduced our recent, temporaryCOVID-19 recovery standard, which provides greater flexibility for educators to use simulated learning where nursing students aren’t able to go into or experience practice placements in the usual way.

I really welcome this announcement by the government, which will support education institutions in England to innovate and invest in simulation and will also help to expand the critical care workforce.

Increasing simulation hours and training facilities will help reduce the pressures on clinical placement capacity across the NHS and social care during the pandemic, and help students get the training they need to qualify and join the workforce.

The new critical care qualification will help staff to develop skills which can be transferred across organisations, providing them with more flexibility to work at hospitals across the country.

The £15 million funding will be provided via immediate grant allocations to universities to help to rapidly expand student nurse simulated learning from this year.

More detail will be published on the qualification in due course.

Birmingham City University is running online simulations for third year students on the Transition to Qualified Practice module, with actors playing patients in ward-based scenarios to develop their clinical decision-making skills.

The Royal College of Nursing has developed the Introducing Critical Care programme, where students can print flash cards and access bite-sized learning resources on their smartphones for more flexibility.",Increase in salary threshold for Skilled Worker and Family Visas,Monetary,,id25_875
876,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/360-million-to-boost-british-manufacturing-and-rd,News story,£360 million to boost British manufacturing and R&D,The Chancellor has today (4 March) announced a significant investment package in the UK’s life sciences and manufacturing sectors.,"HM Treasury, Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, The Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt MP and The Rt Hon Michelle Donelan",3 March 2024,"Ahead of the Spring Budget this week, the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has today (Monday 4 March) announced a significant investment package in the UK’s life sciences and manufacturing sectors, as part of the government’s plan to grow the economy, boost health resilience and support jobs across the UK.

The funding will go towards several companies and projects who are making cutting edge technology in sectors key to economic growth and part of wider government support to ensure the UK is the best place to start, grow and invest in manufacturing.

This includes £7.5 million to support two pharmaceutical companies who are investing a combined £84 million to expand their manufacturing plants in the UK. Almac, a pharmaceutical company in Northern Ireland produces drugs to treat diseases such as cancer, heart disease and depression, while Ortho Clinical diagnostics in Pencoed, Wales, is expanding its facilities producing testing products used to identify a variety of diseases and conditions.

These new life sciences investments are the latest step in the government’s plan to grow our economy, encourage innovation and support levelling up with nearly 300 supported jobs across the UK.

The Chancellor is also confirming that companies will soon be able to apply for a share of the £520 million funding for life sciences manufacturing announced at Autumn Statement, with competitions for large scale investments opening for expressions of interest this summer and medium and smaller sized companies in the autumn. The fund is designed to build resilience for future health emergencies such as influenza pandemics and capitalise on the UK’s world-leading research and development.

On top of this, the government has announced almost £73 million in combined government and industry investment for cutting-edge automotive R&D projects to support the development of electric vehicle technology, delivering highly skilled jobs and cementing the UK’s position as a global hub for EV manufacturing.

Supported by more than £36 million of government funding awarded through Advanced Propulsion Centre UK (APC) competitions, this includes four projects which are developing technologies for the next generation of battery electric vehicles, making them more efficient and competitive, led by companies including automotive manufacturers YASA and Empel Systems.

This funding is also supporting a project led by Integrals Power, developing and scaling up high-performance battery systems ahead of testing their mass-commercialisation, enhancing safety, power density, and cost-efficiency.

These projects build on the record of the government’s established automotive initiatives. The Autumn Statement provided future certainty, announcing over £2 billion across five years from 2025 to unlock investment in the manufacturing and development of zero emission vehicles, their batteries and supply chain. The government will ensure a seamless transition to the new Auto2030 programme which will deliver support in future, and investors are still able to apply to the current schemes.

The government has already spent over £2 billion to accelerate the uptake of zero emission vehicles, including reducing the upfront cost of electric vehicles and supporting the roll-out of charging infrastructure. The UK’s first ever Battery Strategy published last year outlines our plan for the UK to attract investment and achieve a globally competitive battery supply chain by 2030, with the battery sector alone expected to create 100,000 highly paid and skilled jobs in the UK.

The significant funding package for R&D and manufacturing projects announced today is targeted to support sectors where the UK is or could be world-leading and is designed to unlock investment from the private sector by providing certainty to investors - supporting the government’s priority to grow our economy by protecting existing and creating new jobs, so we can deliver the long-term change our country needs to deliver a brighter future.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt said:

“We’re sticking with our plan by backing the industries of the future with millions of pounds of investment to make the UK a world leader in manufacturing, securing the highly-skilled jobs of the future and delivering the long-term change our country needs to deliver a brighter future for Britain”.

Business and Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch said:

“Today’s announcement builds on the success of our Advanced Manufacturing plan announced last year, and will ensure we continue to grow the economy, help create jobs and secure the future of great British manufacturing.

“Our plan for the British economy is working – which is why firms like Airbus and BMW are continuing to bet on Britain.”

Science Secretary, Michelle Donelan, said:

“The UK’s £108 billion life sciences sector is driven by the pioneering contributions of over 300,000 highly-skilled individuals who transform lives through groundbreaking advancements in drug discovery and diagnostics.

“We fuel this progress by fostering a dynamic environment where cutting-edge technologies like AI and genomics meet world-class research to create the next generation of healthcare solutions, including in our NHS. By investing in advanced manufacturing facilities, we are protecting our communities by ensuring we can rapidly respond to future health emergencies and deliver life-saving innovations when they are needed most.”

Further measures include:

Energy Security Secretary Claire Coutinho said:

“We are backing our green industries with extra cash for the Green Industries Growth Accelerator - taking the total to more than £1 billion. We have long been energy pioneers in advanced manufacturing and this will allow us to carry on that great British tradition. While we have attracted £300bn in low carbon investment since 2010, with £24bn since September alone, this will help to unlock even more.”

Today’s announcements follow £4.5 billion announced at Autumn Statement to increase investment in strategic manufacturing sectors – auto, aero, life sciences and clean energy - across the UK for five years from 2025.

Katherine Bennett, CEO of the High Value Manufacturing Catapult said:

“Today’s funding announcements from the Chancellor for R&D and manufacturing projects are welcome news for our domestic life sciences, automotive and aerospace sectors and will support the growth of cross-sector low carbon supply chains across the UK.

“From developing technology for lower-carbon aircraft wings, to supporting the expansion of UK-based supply chains in offshore wind, hydrogen and electrification our network of innovation centres is helping drive industrial transformation across the UK”

Stephen Phipson, Chief Executive of Make UK, said:

“Industry will welcome this announcement as yet another boost for key sectors that will put advanced manufacturing at the heart of the UK’s economic future. These industries will be key to addressing many of the societal challenges we face in a competitive world and highlight what can be achieved with a constructive dialogue between Government and business. Taken together they are another piece in the jigsaw of a modern industrial strategy to make the UK a world leader in key sectors of the future.”

APC Chief Executive Officer Ian Constance said:

“We’re committed to building the electric vehicle supply chain in the UK. By investing in the capability and expertise in this country we will grow businesses and take decisive action towards creating zero tailpipe emission technology. Our latest R&D funding does just that.”

Care workers will now be restricted from bringing dependants, after a disproportionate 120,000 dependants accompanied 100,000 workers on the route last year.

Care providers in England acting as sponsors for migrants will also be required to register with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) – the industry regulator for Health and Social Care – in order to crack down on worker exploitation and abuse within the sector.

It forms part of a wider package of measures, which is being implemented as soon as possible, which means a total of 300,000 people who were eligible to come to the UK last year would now not be able to do so.

Home Secretary, James Cleverly MP, said:

Care workers make an incredible contribution to our society, taking care of our loved ones in times of need. But we cannot justify inaction in the face of clear abuse, manipulation of our immigration system and unsustainable migration numbers.

It is neither right nor fair to allow this unacceptable situation to continue. We promised the British people action, and we will not rest until we have delivered on our commitment to bring numbers down substantially.

Our plan is robust but fair – protecting British workers while ensuring the very best international talent can work and study here, to add value to our society and grow the economy.

There is clear evidence that care workers have been offered visas under false pretences, travelling thousands of miles for jobs that simply don’t exist or to be paid far below the minimum wage required for their work, exploiting them while undercutting British workers.

These changes come into force as the government is set to lay rules in Parliament later this week (14 March) to prevent the continued undercutting of British workers, which includes raising the salary threshold that a skilled worker must meet in order to get a visa and removing the 20% ‘going-rate’ discount for migrant workers in shortage occupations.

Minister for Social Care, Helen Whately MP, said:

International care workers make an invaluable contribution caring for our loved ones, but international recruitment and more immigration are not long-term solutions to our social care needs. These rules provide a more ethical and sustainable approach.

We are boosting our homegrown workforce by reforming social care careers. These include the first ever national career path for care workers and a new care qualification.

Our reforms will grow the domestic workforce and build on our success over the last year that saw more people working in social care, fewer vacancies and lower staff turnover.

The Home Secretary will also, today, commission a review of the graduate route for international students to prevent abuse, protect the integrity and quality of UK higher education, and ensure it works in the best interests of the UK.

He will ask the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) to ensure that demand for the graduate route, through which a total of 175,872 visas have been granted since it was established, is fit for purpose and focused on attracting the best and brightest to the UK.

This follows concerns raised after analysis by the MAC revealed that the number of international postgraduate students attending institutions with the lowest UCAS entry requirements has increased by over 250% between 2018 and 2022.

This follows reforms to student visas which came into force at the start of January, ending the ability of nearly all postgraduate students to bring dependants to the UK. The government expects to see a drastic fall in student dependant applications this year, with early indications already of this downward trend.

In further changes, the Shortage Occupation List (SOL) will be abolished, to be replaced with a new Immigration Salary List on 4 April. This follows a recommendation from the independent MAC, which has also advised the government on which occupations should be temporarily added to the new list initially.

The government has been clear that roles should only be included where they are skilled and in shortage, and that no sector should be permanently reliant on immigration. Inclusion on the list must not serve to reduce pay and undermine the recruitment of British workers.

From 4 April, the minimum salary required for those arriving on the Skilled Worker visa will increase from £26,200 to £38,700 – a 48% increase. This will further drive down numbers, reduce pressure on public services and prevent the undercutting of British workers by employers who look to recruit cheap labour from overseas. The government’s robust approach will prioritise the most talented and highly-skilled people from abroad who will add value and contribute significantly to growth of the economy, whilst encouraging employers to invest in training, upskilling, and recruiting domestic workers.

The minimum income requirement for family visas will also rise, starting at £29,000 from 11 April. By early 2025 this will be increased to £38,700, helping to ensure dependants brought to the UK are supported financially.

The government has been clear that immigration is not the long-term answer to social care needs and care providers should hire more British workers. The Department for Health and Social Care is leading a programme of work to grow and support the domestic social care workforce. This includes better training, clearer career paths and improved job prospects through a new accredited qualification.

The Department for Work and Pensions is taking decisive action in one of the biggest employment interventions in a generation through its £2.5 billion Back to Work plan, which will help 1.1 million people who are long-term unemployed or long-term sick or disabled break down barriers to work.",Conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) extension,Legislative,,id25_877

New 6 month notice periods to be in place until at least 31 March 2021

Once eviction hearings restart, the judiciary will carefully prioritise the most serious cases including those involving anti-social behaviour and domestic abuse

Renters affected by coronavirus will continue to be protected after the government extended the ban on evictions for another 4 weeks, meaning in total no legal evictions will have taken place for 6 months, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has announced today (21 August 2020).

The government also intends to give tenants greater protection from eviction over the winter by requiring landlords to provide tenants with 6 months’ notice in all bar those cases raising other serious issues such as those involving anti-social behaviour and domestic abuse perpetrators, until at least the end of March.

The government will keep these measures under review with decisions guided by the latest public health advice.

When courts do resume eviction hearings they will carefully prioritise the most egregious cases, ensuring landlords are able to progress the most serious cases, such as those involving anti-social behaviour and other crimes, as well as where landlords have not received rent for over a year and would otherwise face unmanageable debts.

The government has taken unprecedented action to support renters during the pandemic, preventing people getting into financial hardship and helping businesses to pay salaries – meaning no tenants have been evicted since the start.

As a result, according to independent research, 87% of tenants have continued to pay full rent since the start of the pandemic, with a further 8% agreeing reduced fees with their landlords.

The vast majority of landlords have shown understanding and leadership, taking action to support tenants.

With coronavirus still posing an ongoing risk to public health, the government will continue to take action where necessary to further protect households in both the private and social rented sector are supported over winter, helping to keep them safe.

Today’s extension to the stay and 6 month notice periods will ensure those most at risk are protected. If tenants are unable to afford their rent we encourage them to speak to their landlord to agree a solution, and some households may decide to consider moving.

Government will continue to work with the judiciary and stakeholders to ensure that the courts are prepared for eviction cases to be heard safely.

Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick MP said:

I know this year has been challenging and all of us are still living with the effects of COVID-19. That is why today I am announcing a further 4 week ban on evictions, meaning no renters will have been evicted for 6 months.

I am also increasing protections for renters – 6 month notice periods must be given to tenants, supporting renters over winter.

However, it is right that the most egregious cases, for example those involving anti-social behaviour or domestic abuse perpetrators, begin to be heard in court again; and so when courts reopen, landlords will once again be able to progress these priority cases.

Case listing, including prioritisation, is a judicial function and we are working with the judiciary through the Master of the Rolls’ Working Group on possession to consider the categories of serious cases that would be prioritised when hearings resume. Further detail on those categories will be set out in due course and we will engage with key stakeholders on this.

Independent polling for the National Residential Landlords Associationrecently found that 87% of private tenants have paid their rent as normal throughout the pandemic so far. An additional 8% said that they had agreed a reduced rent, a rent-free period or made some other agreement with their landlord or letting agent.

The extension to the ban on evictions and prioritisation of the most serious case applies to courts in England and Wales

The intention to extend notice periods to 6 month applies to England only.

On 5 June the government announced that the suspension of housing possession cases in the courts had been extended by a further 2 months.

To support those on Universal Credit or Housing Benefit in the private rented sector, Local Housing Allowance rates have been set to the 30th percentile of rents in each area. For those who require additional support Discretionary Housing Payments are available.

As announced at the spending round for 2020/21 there is already £180 million in Discretionary Housing Payments for Local authorities to distribute for supporting renters with housing costs in the private and social rented sectors.

We remain committed to bringing forward reforms to provide greater security to tenants, but it is only right that this is balanced with an assurance that landlords are able to recover their properties where they have valid reasons to do so. This is vital to ensuring the future supply of good quality housing in the rented sector.

We will bring forward legislation in due course, once the urgencies of responding to the pandemic have passed, to deliver a better deal for renters and a fairer more effective rental market.

The Langarth Deep Geothermal Heat Network will involve drilling to a depth of 5,275 meters to extract the heat from granite rocks beneath the United Downs Industrial Site in Cornwall.

It is one of 7 state-of-the-art heating systems that will receive a share of £91 million from the government’sGreen Heat Network Fund.

Heat networks take heat found underground or use excess heat generated through manufacturing or waste management, and supply heating and hot water to homes and businesses through a connected network.

This allows them to ditch fossil-fuel burning gas and oil boilers, which helps cut costs and reduce carbon emissions. The projects will boost the UK’s energy security and independence and help delivering on the government’s commitment to grow the economy – with the schemes expected to create hundreds of new, skilled jobs.

Among the 7 ground-breaking projects to benefit from the latest round of funding are:

Lord Callanan, Minister for Energy Efficiency and Green Finance, said:

The UK is a world leader when it comes to reducing carbon emissions – but we must continue to push the boundaries to reach our net zero goal.

These innovative projects will not only benefit the communities they serve, by reducing emissions and providing low-cost heating that helps to drive down energy bills, but also support the nation’s push for greater energy security and independence.

They form part of our energy revolution – creating hundreds of new jobs for our ever-expanding green economy.

The Green Heat Network Fund (GHNF) is a £288 million scheme that opened in March 2022 to public, private and third sector applicants in England and is anticipated to run to 2025. It replaced the Heat Networks Investment Project (HNIP) scheme which closed for applications in January 2022.

In contrast to theHNIPscheme, theGHNFscheme will only fund heat network projects where there is a low-carbon heat source.

The funding, announced by the government today, will pave the way for low-carbon technologies – like air source heat pumps, which extract heat from the air, solar and geothermal energy – to be delivered at scale and established as a central source of energy in this country.

Ken Hunnisett, Programme Director for Triple Point Heat Networks Investment Management, delivery partner for theGHNFandHNIP, said:

Continuing the legacy of the firstGHNFprojects to be announced in December, over £91 million more targeted support has been announced from the fund today to deliver low carbon heating across the country.

From Cornwall to London, Reading to Rotherham, funding announced today will go far to help us reach our net zero ambitions and provide clean heating across residential and commercial buildings.

We are excited to work with the teams in each of these locations to deliver these new heating infrastructure projects to help them deliver on their green goals and make a real difference to how we heat our buildings.

Kieran Sinclair, Heat Network Policy Manager at the Association for Decentralised Energy (ADE), said:

It is great to see more low-carbon heat network projects being funded through the Green Heat Network Fund.

They show the potential for heat networks across the UK to reduce both carbon emissions and customer heating bills, while providing clean energy to both public and private sector buildings.

By 2050 a much larger proportion of the country will get their heat from low-carbon heat networks as part of the UK’s net zero targets.

In February, the government also launched the £32 million Heat Network Efficiency Scheme to make vital upgrades to old and inefficient heat networks and provide thousands of homes in England and Wales with cheaper, greener energy.

The government is also taking action to regulate the heat networks market through the Energy Bill. The Bill will appoint Ofgem as heat networks regulator, with new powers to investigate and intervene where prices for consumers appear to be unfair. The legislation also provides the Department’s Secretary of State with powers to introduce a heat networks price cap should it be necessary to protect consumers.

Having suffered a 95% decline in numbers returning to Europe’s rivers since the 1980s, the European Eel is now a critically endangered species.

But ground-breaking research published this week enables us to better understand the lifecycle of this globally important but little-known species and ensure effective protection measures are put in place to combat their decline.

The European Eel is critically endangered so it is important that we solve the mystery surrounding their complete life-cycle to support efforts to protect the spawning area of this important species.

This is the first time we’ve been able to track eels to the Sargasso Sea and we are delighted we have the first direct evidence of adult European eels reaching their spawning area. Their journey will reveal information about eel migration that has never been known before.

The journey of European eels to their breeding place in the Sargasso Sea is up to 10,000km and considered one of the most impressive feats of animal migration observed in nature. It’s a mystery that has perplexed scientists for centuries, with the first recorded evidence of scientists looking into this phenomenon dating back to the 4th century BC.

Working alongside the Zoological Society of London, Defra, Cefas, Natural England, the University of Azores and the Denmark University of Technology, the Environment Agency has produced the first ever direct evidence of European eels navigating the last 2,500km leg of their journey. Up until this point, no eggs or eels had been found to confirm this spawning ground.

Back in December 2018 and 2019, researchers fitted 26 large female European eels with satellite tags and released them from the Azores into the Atlantic Ocean. The Azores islands are close to the furthest known point on the eel migration route that was tracked by previous projects.

Programmed to detach and transmit their data after 6-12 months, data were received from 23 satellite tags at various stages of the journey, with six tagged eels reaching the Sargasso Sea. Data transmitted from these tags reveal the eels migrated consistently towards the Sargasso Sea and, remarkably, that this journey to their breeding grounds takes over a year.

Once eels spawn in the Sargasso Sea, their larvae return to the UK and other European waters via a different route, carried on ocean currents on the North Atlantic Drift. They then migrate into rivers as glass eels.

Unravelling the navigation mechanisms, routes taken and locating where eels spawn is critical for understanding the reasons behind their decline and putting in place targeted conservation measures to protect this globally important species.

Populations of the European eel are at a historic low and the more we understand their life-history, the better we are able to develop conservation measures to address the critical status of the species.

This discovery emphasizes the role of the Azores in the life cycle of eels. It will help scientist and conservationists to push for measures to restore eel habitats across the archipelago.

The Environment Agency and partners will now conduct a deeper analysis of the satellite tag data to uncover further clues on how eels navigate to their spawning area. This is part of an ongoing project and field teams have returned to the Azores to satellite tag eels with extended life tags to reveal more data on silver eel migration and spawning sites in the Sargasso Sea.

The Environment Agency continue to carry out research on all life stages of the European eel to inform conservation measures. This complements work around England to protect eels, for example improving eel pass design to enhance upstream eel passage into our rivers.

Themarine plans– which provide much-needed guidance for sustainable development in English waters – cover the coast and seas from Flamborough Head to Felixstowe.

They have been developed by the Marine Management Organisation on behalf of the Secretary of State Owen Paterson, who has formally approved the plans.

Aninteractive toolexplaining how marine plans affect your area also goes live today (2 April) – the Marine Information System.

Marine plans will inform and guide decisions on development in marine and coastal areas, while conserving and enhancing the environment and recognising leisure uses too.

This should reduce costs and increase certainty for developers, boosting economic and employment benefits for coastal communities and beyond.

The first two plans cover the East inshore and offshore areas, with a total of 11 plans covering all English waters anticipated by 2021.Our seas have become increasingly busy, with industries such as oil and gas, wind farms, shipping, aggregates and fishing competing for space with each other and with nature. The marine economy is currently worth more than £49 billion a year and has the potential to grow significantly.

Environment Minister George Eustice said:

UK seas are home to one of the richest marine environments in the world and are currently worth more than £49 billion a year to our economy.

We are making sure that environmental considerations are embedded in every decision about proposed developments along the coast from Flamborough Head to Felixstowe and in our seas out to the maritime borders with the Netherlands, Belgium and France.

By 2021, marine plans will cover the entire English marine area, supporting an estimated £50 million of economic benefit each year and helping to promote sustainable development of the marine area.

MMO Chief Executive James Cross added:

These plans are the culmination of years of work by government, industry, environmental organisations and many others.

We are delighted to be at the forefront of sustainable marine development, cutting red tape for developers while taking full account of social and environmental impacts.

The UK has one of the richest marine environments in the world, with more than 8,000 species recorded in our seas.

Plans will take full account of marine protected areas, recognising the wealth of species and habitats in our seas

TheMarine Information Systemis an interactive tool to understand how the East marine plans apply to different marine sectors and geographic areas. It will highlight policies that apply to a chosen area to inform plan users, and mapping information makes searching for your area of interest easier.

Experience from developing the East marine plans is already informing the approach to the next two marine plans in the South – from Folkestone to the River Dart in Devon – including expanding the evidence base.

It is funding, amongst others, the University of Strathclyde to work with organisations including MIT and the Alan Turing Institute to use Artificial Intelligence to improve space operations, safety and sustainability.

Vertical Future is developing a robotic ‘space farm’ facility to grow plants in space, and Rolls-Royce is working with US company BWXT on space nuclear power.

From developing new technology for high-resolution photos of the Moon and Mars, to X-ray imaging that will help scientists study the Earth’s Aurora in unprecedented detail, the 11 projects showcase valuable missions and capabilities, and highlight the breadth of expertise found across the UK’s vibrant space sector which employs around 49,000 people.

The £13 million funding boost was announced on the opening day of the 39th Space Symposium in Colorado Springs (Monday 8 April).

Space Minister at DSIT, Andrew Griffith MP, said:

The UK is home to some of the brightest minds in space science, aerospace engineering and an entrepreneurial commercial space sector. It’s no wonder the world wants to collaborate with Britain when it comes to space.

I am delighted that today we have been able to support new space collaborations with private organisations from countries like the US, Australia, Canada, India and Singapore.

This is the second phase of investment awarded through the UK Space Agency’s £20 million International Bilateral Fund, following the first phase in August 2023.  Phase 1 funded 32 projects up to £75,000 each, all of whom entered into a highly competitive process for further funding from Phase 2.

Dr Paul Bate, Chief Executive of the UK Space Agency, said:

We want to draw on the best global talent to push the boundaries of new technology such as AI and space nuclear power, enhance our homegrown space capabilities and catalyse investment into the UK economy.

The projects supported by our International Bilateral Fund champion the best of British innovation, while strengthening our ties with the wider space community. Together we can break new ground, further our understanding of the Universe and use the vast power of space to protect and benefit lives on Earth.

As further evidence of the success of the UK-Australia Space Bridge, the International Bilateral Fund has been bolstered by a co-funding commitment from the Australian Space Agency, worth AUS$3 million.

Projects supported by Australia include Aquawatch-AUK, led by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL), which is using disruptive space technologies to develop a world class integrated water quality monitoring and forecasting system for use across the UK, Australia and beyond.

Head of the Australian Space Agency Enrico Palermo said:

This funding builds on the collaboration fostered through the UK-Australia Space Bridge. By working with our international partners like the UK, we can continue to grow the Australian space sector while delivering outcomes that benefit communities in both of our nations.

From addressing food security and water scarcity to the health of our waterways, the projects being supported through this fund reiterate how space can help address the biggest global challenges we are facing – as well as the power of working together to solve a common problem.

Space Symposiumruns from 8-11 April in Colorado Springs and brings together over 10,000 people from the global space industry. The UK’s growing space sector is represented at the event by organisations including the UK Space Agency, UK Research & Innovation (UKRI), various government departments, companies and universities.

UKspace Director, Lizzie Kerr, said:

It is great news that so many of our members and partner organisations across the UK have been successful in this round of funding. Given space is inherently a global endeavour, the International Bilateral Fund investment will support and strengthen international collaborations between UK industry and research partners and their counterparts across the world.

Following the original IBF announcement at the 38th Space Symposium, we are really encouraged by the positive progress made during the past 12 months. UKspace will be at the 39th Space Symposium and we are keen to explore how we can help foster new collaborative partnerships with trade associations around the world.

Originally launched in November 2021,UKRIhas issued over 2,000 grant offers worth £1.05 billion to the end of April 2023. The extension will ensure that eligible, successful UK applicants will continue to be guaranteed funding, supporting them to continue their important work in research and innovation.

The guarantee will be in place to cover all Horizon Europe calls that close on or before 30 September 2023. Eligible, successful applicants to Horizon Europe will receive the full value of their funding at their UK host institution for the lifetime of their grant.

Science and Technology Secretary Chloe Smith said:

This extension offers certainty to our world-class researchers that they will receive the support they need to continue their ground-breaking work, building on the over £1 billion in support awarded so far, while negotiations over association to Horizon Europe remain ongoing.

Successful awardees do not need to leave the UK to receive this funding, which will provide reassurance for future collaborations, and support UK researchers whether association is confirmed, or otherwise.

The government remains in discussion on the UK’s involvement in EU research programmes and hopes that negotiations on Horizon Europe will be successful, as that is our preference. However, our participation must be fair for UK researchers, businesses and taxpayers and reflect the lasting impact of two years of EU delays to the UK’s association. We will continue to engage with representatives across the business, research and innovation sector as these discussions progress.

Our priority is to ensure the UK’sR&Dsector gets the maximum level of support to allow them to continue their ground-breaking research and collaboration with international partners, and the extension of the guarantee provides certainty for researchers while negotiations continue.

These licences (GL 04/05/06) cover 16 species of birds including several members of the crow family, Canada goose, some gulls and pigeons.

The change follows a legal challenge to the way the licences have been issued, which could mean users who rely on them are not acting lawfully.

Natural England is working at pace to put in place over the next few weeks alternative measures to allow lawful control of these bird species to continue where necessary. In the meantime, once the licences have been revoked and until new licences are issued, anyone needing to control one of these 16 bird species where there is no reasonable non-lethal alternative will need to apply for an individual licence.

The action is the first stage of a planned review of general and class licences, which will be completed this year.

Natural England’s interim chief executive Marian Spain said:

We recognise this change will cause disruption for some people, but we are working hard to ensure it is kept to a minimum.

We will bring forward interim measures as quickly as possible as the first stage of our planned review of the licences. We want to make sure our licensing system is robust and proportionate, taking into account the needs of wildlife and people.

It is expected that, over time, many situations currently covered by the three general licences will be covered by new licences.

Natural England is undertaking new licensing assessments to support lethal control of certain birds in defined situations, such as to prevent serious damage to livestock from carrion crow and to preserve public health and safety from the impacts of feral pigeons. It intends to start issuing these licences on gov.uk from the week commencing 29 April when more details will be available.

If people need to take action in the meantime they will need to apply for an individual licence, using a simplified process which will be available on gov.uk from 25 April.

In limited circumstances, people may be allowed to undertake urgent action in accordance with the existing requirements of section 4 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.

Anyone exercising lethal control of birds after Thursday 25 April 2019 without taking the above steps will not be covered by a general licence and could be committing an offence.

If you are unsure what you should do on your land,visit the Natural England licensing webpage for more information and advice.

General licences were introduced in the 1990s to allow the legal control of bird species of low conservation concern to protect public health and safety, prevent serious damage and disease, and protect plants and wildlife.

Further details of the wider review into the operation and provision of general licences will be shared shortly. We will seek feedback from those using them and from wildlife protection and other groups. We expect to complete this review by the end of the year.

Part of Natural England’s role is to ensure relevant provisions of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 are upheld to protect wildlife, as well as recognising the needs of people.

Currently the three licences subject to the legal challenge cover 16 bird species, including several members of the crow family (crows, magpies, rooks, jackdaws and jays), feral and wood pigeon and number of invasive non-native species (such as Canada goose).

Victims of the fatal asbestos-induced cancer mesothelioma who can’t trace a liable employer or an employers’ liability insurer will soon be able to apply for compensation packages worth an average of £123,000. The government has increased this from the initial £115,000 debated in the House of Commons in January after making savings in the administration costs of the scheme.

Around 3,500 victims of the aggressive cancer or their families can apply for compensation from next month and will receive a payment of around £123,000 from July this year, as part of a £380 million package.

Mesothelioma, which often takes 40 to 50 years to present symptoms after exposure to asbestos, has resulted in over 300 people every year struggling to find a relevant party to sue for damages, because companies become insolvent or insurance records go missing.

Work and Pensions Minister, Mike Penning said:

This will end years of injustice for mesothelioma victims and their families – who have had to endure this terrible disease with little hope of any compensation from the insurance industry.

We have made it an absolute priority to bring in the scheme as soon as legislation will allow, so I am pleased to announce that victims will be able to apply for payments from next month.

The Mesothelioma Act was passed in January and allowed for the creation of a new package of support – funded by insurance firms – to pay in excess of 800 eligible people in 2014 and 300 every year after that, until 2024. Victims, or their dependents (where the sufferer has died), will receive substantially higher payments than the statutory schemes currently operated by government. They will also get an additional £7,000 towards legal expenses.

The claims handling company Gallagher Bassett has been appointed to run the compensation scheme.

The government has increased payments from around £115,000 (75% of average civil damages) to around £123,000 (80% of average civil damages). This ensures the scheme pays as much as possible to mesothelioma victims without risking insurers passing the additional costs onto businesses through increased insurance premiums.

On top of the payments applicants will receive from the scheme, the scheme will pay £7,000 towards legal fees. The applicant will be paid this amount directly with their scheme payment, not to lawyers. The scheme has been designed to accept direct applications from applicants, to enable people to apply without the aid of a solicitor. In these cases, the individual would retain the £7,000 in legal fees.

Any benefits or lump sum payments received from the government previously in respect of the disease will be deducted from the final payment.

DWPresearch estimates that 300 applications per year will be paid by the scheme and that this number will drop slowly over time.

Mesothelioma is a cancer of the lining of internal organs, such as the lungs, and almost always arises from exposure to asbestos. Life expectancy from diagnosis is 8 to 9 months on average. The long time that mesothelioma takes to develop – sometimes 40 to 50 years after exposure before symptoms appear – means that some workers were negligently exposed to asbestos at work but their employers are no longer in existence to make a claim against. Insurance records from the time are also often incomplete.

The new scheme will pay those who develop diffuse mesothelioma as a result of negligent exposure to asbestos at work and are unable to claim compensation because they cannot trace a liable employer or employers’ liability insurer. The scheme applies to people diagnosed with mesothelioma from 25 July 2012.

In April 2011, the Association of British Insurers voluntarily established the Employers’ Liability Tracing Office (ELTO) – an electronic database of employers’ liability insurance policies to which 99% of employers liability insurers’ provide data.

Asbestos prohibition laws in the United Kingdom were first introduced in the mid-1980s. In 1985, the UK banned the import and use of both blue (crocidolite) and brown (amosite) asbestos. This rule was replaced in 1992 with a law that also banned some uses of white (chrysotile) asbestos – traditionally considered less lethal than the other forms of the mineral. In 1999, the government decided, with no exceptions, to ban the use and import of chrysotile asbestos.

Other asbestos-related laws passed during the 1990s stipulated that work on any asbestos insulation products (removal, etc.) may only be carried out by a licensed asbestos professional. Asbestos-at-work regulations have set maximum exposure limits and require that all asbestos be identified and managed properly. Regulations also require that employees at risk for asbestos exposure be trained in asbestos safety precautions.

Unregistered community designs that arise before the end of the transition period will continue to be protected in the UK for the remainder of their three year term through continuing unregistered designs.

From 1 January 2021, a  supplementary unregistered design (SUD) will become available in UK law.

TheSUDwill provide similar protection to that conferred by the unregistered Community design, but for the UK only.

TheSUDwill be established by first disclosure in the UK or another qualifying country.
First disclosure in theEUwill not establish aSUDright. It could destroy the novelty of the design should you later seek to establish UK unregistered rights.

Business will need to consider carefully where to disclose their products to ensure they have adequate protection in their most important market.

The funding package for 5-16 schools includes £2.6 billion for 2020/21, £4.8 billion for 21/22, and £7.1 billion for 22/23 compared to 19/20. This will bring the schools budget to £52.2bn in 22/23.

This delivers on the Prime Minister’s pledge when entering Downing Street to increase school funding by £4.6bn above inflation, levelling up education funding and giving all young people the same opportunities to succeed – regardless of where they grow up or go to school.

As part of this, every secondary school will receive a minimum of £5,000 per pupil next year, with every primary school getting a minimum of £4,000 from 2021/22.

The deal includes £780 million extra for children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) in 2020/21, so every pupil can access the education that is right for them, and none are held back from reaching their potential.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:

When I became Prime Minister at the start of the summer, I promised to make sure every child receives a superb education - regardless of which school they attend, or where they grew up.

Today I can announce the first step in delivering on that pledge – funding per pupil in primary and secondary schools will increase, and be levelled up across the entire country.

We should not accept the idea that there can be “winners or losers” when it comes to our children’s futures. That’s why we are providing additional funding now and for the future for every school, with those historically underfunded receiving the greatest increase.

My government will ensure all young people get the best possible start in life. That means the right funding, but also giving schools the powers they need to deal with bad behaviour and bullying so pupils continue to learn effectively.

The additional funding comes ahead of next week’s Spending Round, and gives schools the certainty they need to plan their budgets.

It will:

Today’s funding boost comes on top of a near £1.5 billion each year to continue to fund additional pension costs for teachers.

The Chancellor Sajid Javid said:

We said our priorities were police, healthcare and education, and that’s what we are delivering at next week’s Spending Round. Because of the hard work of the British people to put our finances in order, we can now invest in their priorities.

As I know from my own experience, nothing is more important to a child’s future than their education. That’s why we are putting in place the funding that helps them realise their potential, to the benefit of us all.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said:

We owe it to the next generation to ensure our education system is world class, and that nothing stands in the way of our young people having the best choices in life, whatever course they take.

This £14billion funding increase – the largest cash boost in a generation - means our schools can continue to raise standards and build an education system that boosts productivity, improves social mobility and equips children with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the bright future that lies ahead.

In addition to this package, schools will receive £4.4billion over three years to cover rising pension costs and ensure they can focus their resources on the front line.

Schools will also continue to benefit from government support to ensure they can make the most of every pound of their budgets, following the launch of the Department for Education’s School Resource Management Strategy last year.

This ranges from a free-to-use vacancy service to recruit teachers, to expert advisers who provide tailored support to individual schools that need it.

Since 2010, education standards in England have rocketed. Government reforms have seen more primary school children on track to become fluent readers, more 19-year-olds leaving education with English and Maths GCSEs, and almost one million school places created.",Awards event and recognition of cadets,Welfare,,id25_889
890,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/environment-agency-convenes-national-drought-group,News story,Environment Agency convenes National Drought Group,Dry weather impacts expected to continue as key decision makers come together to discuss current situation.,Environment Agency,26 July 2022,"People across the country have been urged to use water wisely to protect water supplies and the environment during the current period of prolonged dry weather.

Today (Tuesday 26 July) the Environment Agency convened theNational Drought Group, made up of senior decision makers from Environment Agency, government, water companies, Water UK, the NFU and environmental protection groups including the Angling Trust and Rivers Trust. The group discussed the current situation and agreed actions to protect water resources and the environment in the UK in the weeks ahead.

Following Tuesday’s meeting, the National Drought Group’s members agreed to continue to work closely together to monitor and manage the current situation, including convening the National Drought Group’s water supply and communications sub-groups.

Harvey Bradshaw, Environment Agency executive director for the environment and chair of the NDG, said:

While last week’s extreme high temperatures are now behind us and there are currently no plans for restrictions on essential water use, we can all do our bit by reducing unnecessary water consumption and following advice from our water company to ensure this remains the case whilst our rivers are exceptionally low.

We are working very closely with water companies, farmers and other water users to manage the current situation. Today’s meeting was an important step in agreeing joint actions to protect our water resources with further dry weather forecasted for August, including ever-closer working to monitor and manage water supplies and the environment.

Environment Agency teams are doing brilliant work across the country monitoring river levels and responding to environmental incidents, as well as enacting the early stages of our drought plans in many parts of England to protect people’s access to water and preserve the environment.

Stuart Colville, Water UK Director of Policy, said

Ongoing warm weather in much of the country follows the driest winter and spring since the 1970s.

Water companies have detailed plans in place to manage water resources for customers and the environment, and are doing everything they can, including working closely with government and regulators, to minimise the need for any restrictions and ensure rivers continue to flow.

As we continue to see extremely high demand, we are urging everyone to carefully consider the amount they are using given the unprecedented conditions. The water industry is running a national water saving campaign called Water’s Worth Saving that provides the public with helpful hints and tips on how to do their bit with water use in the home and garden.

Regulators and water companies are working together closely to manage water levels and take action where needed, including activating different levels of well-established dry weather plans in the most affected areas.

Most of England has moved into ‘Prolonged Dry Weather’ status – meaning the EA is now taking precautionary actions to mitigate impacts as hydrological conditions deteriorate and enhancing its monitoring and protection of water resources, along with the water companies.

Nowhere in England is currently considered to be ‘in drought’ and most water companies are maintaining good reservoir storage for summer demand. If further measures are required, temporary use bans (more commonly known as hosepipe bans) will be determined by individual water companies and drought permits and drought orders by the Environment Agency and Defra respectively.

However, recent abnormally high temperatures have exacerbated conditions resulting from lower-than-normal rainfall so far this year in many parts of England. With the Met Office forecasting potentially several more dry weeks ahead, particularly in the South and East of the country, the EA and water companies are now enacting the early stages of their well-rehearsed and publicly available drought plans and calling on everyone to do their bit in managing water use.

This will become even more vital in the future as we continue to adapt to a changing climate. Projections show that, by 2050, some rivers could have between 50 and 80 percent less water during the summer and summer temperatures are set to be up to 7.4 degrees hotter.

The EA takes a broad range of measures to manage drought risk, with many already in action. These include:

The National Drought Group will continue to work together very closely over the coming weeks and will next meet in August.

The following organisations attended the National Drought Group today: Environment Agency; Defra; Natural Resources Wales; Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities; Ofwat; UKHSA; Natural England; Welsh Government; Met Office; AHDB; Yorkshire Water; Southern Water; Anglian Water; Affinity Water; Severn Trent Water; Thames Water; South West Water; South East Water; South Staffs Water; Northumbria Water; Water UK; National Farmers Union; Angling Trust; Energy UK; Canal and River Trust; Rivers Trust; RSPB; MOSL; Waterwise; SES; Consumer Council for Water; Drinking Water Inspectorate.

The National Drought Group meets twice yearly (spring and autumn) to assess the water resource situation ahead and any risks to water supply and the environment. It met in March ahead of the spring/summer season and is planned to meet in October this year ahead of the winter season. The group convenes at the early stages of drought (known as prolonged dry weather), and it met regularly through 2018-2020 to manage the last drought.

The ceremony took place at the Ivy Bush Royal, Carmarthen, on Thursday 7 March.

The 5 were: Colin Sharp and Hilary Anderson, both of Milford Haven Sea Cadet Corps; Sub Lieutenant (SCC) Lucy Killick RNR of Llanelli Sea Cadet Corps; Staff Sergeant Instructor Colleen Chinnery, and Staff Sergeant Instructor Kirsty Richards of Dyfed and Glamorgan Army Cadet Force.

During the evening, 3 long service and volunteer service awards were presented to members of the Sea Cadet Corps.

The achievements of the Lord-Lieutenant’s two cadets were also recognised and celebrated during the event, which was attended by more than 80 people.

Petty Officer Cadet Annis Henton of Fishguard Sea Cadet Corps, and Petty Officer Cadet Luke Coburn of Tenby Sea Cadet Corps outlined to the audience their time in cadets, including highlights of their role over the last 12 months.

The role, which continues until September, includes attendance with the Lord-Lieutenant at a number of official engagements, such as Remembrance events, Royal visits and parades.

The two were selected for the prestigious Lord-Lieutenant’s cadet role after being put forward for nomination by cadet group leaders and the Reserve Forces’ and Cadets’ Association (RFCA) for Wales.

The support from the Department for International Development will challenge misinformation in South East Asia and Africa, which is then spreading worldwide, and direct people to the right advice to help stop the spread of the virus.

False claims and conspiracy theories have spread rapidly on social media, touting ‘cures’ like drinking bleach or rubbing mustard and garlic into your skin. These pose a serious risk to health and can speed up the spread of the virus, by stopping people taking simple practical, preventative steps like washing their hands.

DFID’s £500,000 support will go to the Humanitarian-to-Humanitarian (H2H) Network, which has extensive experience addressing the spread of misinformation during epidemics, for example following the 2015 Ebola outbreak.

The work of the H2H Network will complement UK initiatives by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and the NHS to tackle misinformation online.

International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said:

Misinformation harms us all. By tackling it at source we will help stop the spread of fake news – and coronavirus – worldwide, including within the UK.

H2H will work with partners BBC Media Action and Internews to create verified information in various languages to tackle specific mistruths spreading in South East Asia and Africa. Their work will also support journalists in these regions to write more accurately about the virus using information from the World Health Organization.

Support will also go to Translators without Borders, which monitors false information in various languages and translates validated content from WHO and other health agencies, and Evidence Aid which updates a database of research on diseases each day.

The initiative will analyse social media and online content to identify where the misinformation is coming from and how it is spreading – so victims of fake news can be sent the correct information and directed to official health advice.

H2H will also work with social media influencers – vloggers and bloggers – to help spread accurate health information and reach younger online audiences that are more susceptible to fake news.

Some of the social media influencers being engaged include:

Bianca Gonzalez, a health expert and YouTube vlogger from the Philippines with over 7 million followers on Twitter @iamsuperbianca

Dr Jahangir Kabir, a Bangladeshi health expert and popular TV presenter with over 1 million Facebook followers @DrJahangirkabircmc

@KlikDokter – An Indonesian health blog with over 4 million Facebook followers

Some of the more damaging mistruths being targeted include:

‘Miracle cures’ for the virus, such as drinking chlorine dioxide, an industrial bleach, or urine, eating garlic, gargling saltwater or spreading cow dung and mustard paste. In Myanmar, news websites have reported false claims supposedly from health officials, advising people to sleep next to chopped onions claiming this will “absorb the virus” or to drink ginger juice. It is also falsely claimed you cannot catch coronavirus if you have a mosquito bite. Scammers pretending to be health officials in Myanmar have been selling black pepper seeds as a cure.

Undermining health officials: In Tanzania, people have received a WhatsApp message claiming to be from the health ministry and telling them drinking warm water every few minutes will prevent infection. The exact same message has also appeared in French throughout West Africa, claiming to be from the Canadian Health Ministry. Messages like this are undermining the efforts of real health officials to contain the virus, damaging trust in official advice and confusing people.

Promoting violence: Rumours that the virus was created or spread deliberately have already led to reported attacks on Chinese nationals across South East Asia as well as in the UK. A video claiming to show Chinese officials shooting coronavirus victims and alleging tens of thousands were executed went viral on social media sites worldwide, after the celebrity sister of a prominent Bollywood actor in India shared them. The video was in fact edited from four completely unrelated clips, including one of Chinese police shooting a rabid dog.

Public Health England is regularly updating its advice on coronavirus, including how people can help stop the spread of infection.  Individuals are also being advised to call NHS 111 or contact the NHS dedicated 111 online coronavirus service if they are concerned about any symptoms or any contact they may have had with someone who might be infected.

The H2H Network consists of approximately 50 organisations, which provide specialist services to the humanitarian aid sector, including tackling fake news in the wake of disasters and epidemics. The H2H Network is supported by UK aid and hosted by the Danish Refugee Council (DRC). This support is a new allocation of UK aid support from the UK’s aid commitment.

The World Health Organization warned in February about an ‘infodemic’ of false information which risked worsening the spread of the virus

The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport earlier this week announced the creation of a new cross-Government counter disinformation unit bringing together expert teams to help provide a comprehensive picture on the potential extent, scope and impact of disinformation on coronavirus in the UK.

The DCMS-led unit will have regular and robust engagement with social media companies to monitor interference and limit the spread of disinformation.

NHS England has also partnered with social media sites and search engines to ensure that official health advice is shown in online searches about the virus, as well as to verify or remove accounts claiming to be from local health authorities

The new UK aid-backed initiative announced today will complement these efforts, by challenging misinformation beyond the UK, targeting the source of fake news spreading in and from Africa and South East Asia

The new LionLink will connect the UK and the Netherlands with offshore wind farms, providing clean affordable and secure energy to Britain which will help cut household bills and drive Putin’s Russia further out of the energy market.

The cross-border electricity line will be only the second of its kind in the world, with the first having been built by Germany and Denmark. However, it will be able to carry more than 4 times the amount of electricity as its predecessor – making it the largest of its kind in terms of capacity anywhere in the world.

While normal interconnectors only connect 2 countries, the multipurpose LionLink will join the UK and Netherlands to each other as well as simultaneously with offshore wind farms at the heart of the North Sea.

The government is announcing the innovative project between the UK and the Netherlands as Energy Security Secretary Grant Shapps leads a British business delegation to the crucial North Sea Summit in Belgium today, aiming to boost our collective energy security through new renewable energy and interconnector projects.

This is part of the government’s efforts to work with business to grow the economy, one of the Prime Minister’s 5 priorities. Boosting clean energy not only helps create better paid jobs across the country but also strengthens economic security by reducing reliance on foreign gas supplies.

The summit will see 9 countries meet in Ostend to agree ambitions for building future offshore wind farms. While there, the Energy Security Secretary is also expected to sign a historic agreement with Denmark to boost trade in cheaper, cleaner energy.

Energy Security Secretary Grant Shapps said:

Today’s historic deal with the Netherlands connects our two countries together through this exciting feat of innovation and engineering - the largest of its kind in the world which will provide enough electricity for more homes than in Manchester and Birmingham combined.

Together with the strong ties we have with our northern European neighbours united today at the North Sea Summit, we are bolstering our energy security and sending a strong signal to Putin’s Russia that the days of his dominance over global power markets are well and truly over.

I’m proud to have the best of UK energy firms and organisations with me, flying the flag for British business and demonstrating our world-leading expertise in cleaner, cheaper and secure renewable technologies - helping deliver on one of our 5 priorities to grow the economy.

Ben Wilson, President National Grid Ventures, said:

Connecting wind farms to multiple markets simultaneously is a game changer for energy infrastructure and brings us one step closer to realising the enormous green energy potential of the North Sea.

Not only can we deploy every spare electron where it is needed most, we can help to reduce the impact of infrastructure on coastal communities.

We now need the right political, legal and regulatory framework to make it happen and establish a mutually beneficial North Sea grid to deliver a cleaner, fairer, more secure and more affordable energy future for British and European consumers.

The countries attending today’s summit alongside the UK are Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway and the Netherlands

The new LionLink will carry 1.8GW of electricity, compared to Germany and Denmark’s Kassø-Frøslev (Kriegers Flag), which carries 0.4GW.  It will be developed by National Grid Ventures and TenneT and will be operational by the early 2030s.

This builds on the 8.4GW interconnector capacity that the UK has – and LionLink alone will increase that by up to a fifth, meaning more clean and affordable power for UK homes and businesses.

This increased interconnectivity also means LionLink will be good both for the UK’s coastal communities and the environment by reducing the need for further onshore construction and visible infrastructure, as well as lessening the impact on the North Sea’s wildlife.

Britain’s world-class innovation, knowledge and skills within the North Sea energy sector is expected to bring £20 billion a year of investment to the UK’s coastal regions and create 40,000 skilled green jobs to Britain.

Manon van Beek, CEO of TenneT, said:

It is our conviction that offshore hubs configured in a meshed DC grid must form the backbone of the North Sea powerhouse.

This is a view that is increasingly shared, and for us, it is more than a vision of the future.

In fact, we are already doing it by kicking off this ground-breaking LionLink project right now. It is a first step and a great opportunity to learn as the offshore grid takes shape.

Minister Rob Jetten, Climate & Energy for the Netherlands:

With the North Sea becoming the largest supplier of green electricity for the Netherlands and large parts of Europe, we are ready to expand the interconnection between the 2 countries. LionLink provides close to 2 gigawatts of electricity to both countries, enough to power 2 million households.

This new connection further boosts energy security and energy independence in Europe. Close collaboration on offshore wind energy and interconnection amongst the North Sea countries is imperative.

So in case there is a surplus of wind generated electricity, it can be shared instantly to locations with a shortage of power, and vice versa.

The Energy Security Secretary is also expected to sign a Memorandum of Understanding between the UK and Denmark today, which will ensure further collaboration on the transition from fossil fuels to renewable technologies – offshore wind, especially.

Danish Minister for Climate, Energy and Utilities Lars Aagaard said:

I welcome this new agreement between our 2 great offshore nations. Both Denmark and the UK have a long tradition for utilizing our windblown shores for the green transition and together I believe we can contribute to an even faster acceleration of the build out of renewables in the North Sea.",Help to Buy: Equity Loan scheme,Welfare,,id25_893

Changing the driving test will help to do this, by making it a better assessment of the candidate’s ability to drive independently in modern driving conditions.

DVSAhas published aconsultation asking for views on the changes. The deadline to have your say is 25 August 2016.

The changes are to:

Road collisions are the biggest killer of young people. They account for over a quarter of all deaths of those aged between 15 and 19.

DVSAwants to make sure that training and the driving test reduce the number of young people being killed in collisions.

These changes have been proposed because:

DVSAis working with the Transport Research Laboratory to find outhow the changes better reflect real-life driving.

Over 4,500 learner drivers and 850 driving instructors have been taking part in a research trial at 32 locations across Great Britain.

The trial is due to end later in 2016, and a full report on the findings will then be published.

DVSAChief Executive, Gareth Llewellyn, said:

Great Britain’s roads are among the safest in the world. But there’s still more that we can do to keep road users safe - particularly newly-qualified drivers.

Making sure that the test better assesses a driver’s ability to drive safely and independently is part of our strategy to help every driver through a lifetime of safe driving.

DVSAChief Driving Examiner, Lesley Young, added:

Candidates will be given more responsibility for making decisions during the test. We want them to show they can cope with distractions and assess risk without the intervention of their instructor or examiner.

Initial feedback from those who have taken part in the trial and representatives from the driver training industry has been positive and supportive of the proposed changes.

They include driving instructor associations, the RAC, the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM), The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) and the AA.

Driving Instructors Association CEO, Carly Brookfield, said:

We fully welcome the developments to the test and are compelled by the evidence we have seen to date from the trial to recommend that these long overdue developments are made to a driving test - which has been fundamentally unchanged for over 20 years and has not kept pace with how our roads and driver behaviour has developed over time.

Head of BSM, Mark Peacock, said:

The proposed changes to the practical driving test, particularly the extended independent driving and use of a sat nav, should help to produce better, safer motorists. We have already had positive feedback from our instructors and their pupils and therefore fully support these proposed changes.

AA president, Edmund King OBE, said:

Ministers also pointed to the delivery of almost a third of a million additional homes in the last 2 years, and 150,000 more affordable homes have been built under this government. Mr Pickles said that housing supply and confidence is now increasing, and has turned a corner since the unsustainable housing bubble burst under the last administration.

Latest figures show that:

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

This government’s package of measures to boost the housing market is working, with house building and housing supply on the up. The tough decisions we’ve taken to tackle the deficit are now delivering a sustainable increase in housing and providing real help to hard-working people.

With over 10,000 reservations in 4 months, it’s clear that the Help to Buy: Equity Loan scheme is working well. By dealing with the big challenges, we are helping thousands of young people and families get on and move up the housing ladder, and Britain is building again.

Help to Buy consists of 2 schemes. The Equity Loan for new build properties, has nearly 3,000 sales already completed and has had over 10,000 formal reservations in the first 4 months.TheHelp to Buy: Equity Loan schemewill help up to 74,000 homebuyers over next 3 years. Under the Equity Loan scheme, buyers receive a 20% equity loan, interest-free for 5 years, which helps creditworthy buyers purchase a new build property from a participating house builder with a value of up to £600,000.

TheHelp to Buy: Mortgage Guarantee scheme,administered by HM Treasury, will begin in January 2014. It will enable lenders to use government-backed guarantees to offer £130 billion worth of mortgages with smaller deposits of at least 5% on new and existing properties for creditworthy buyers. This will further increase the availability of mortgages and help promote confidence and house building.

Mark Clare, Chief Executive of Barratt said:

Customer interest in the Help to Buy scheme has been very strong as it addresses the issue of lack mortgage finance at higher loan to values. Interest has been particularly encouraging from customers previously locked out of the market by high deposit requirements. Post the Budget announcement, compared with last year, we saw reservations step up 18% and visits to the Barratt website increase by around 30%.

Our production will rise to meet higher levels of demand and it’s likely that our completions this year will be up 20% on 2 years ago. We are investing in land and bringing it through planning too and we are also expanding the business by taking on 600 new apprentices and graduates to tackle the skills shortage that could constrain future growth.

Jeff Fairburn, Group Chief Executive of Persimmon, said:

Since the introduction of the Help to Buy measures in April, we’ve seen a notable increase in customer interest and visitors to our sites, resulting in a stronger level of sales reservations across England. In response we have increased our build activity to meet this increase in demand. If this early interest is maintained, the Help to Buy Scheme will play an important role in enabling the industry to increase the volume of new homes built over the coming months and years. And in addition to helping the housing shortage this will have wider benefits for jobs and the economy - for example Persimmon has already decided to make significant further investment in trade apprentices this year to support the anticipated increase in output.

Pete Redfern, Chief Executive of Taylor Wimpey said:

It enables us to build more homes on the sites we have already got open, and also gives us more confidence about investing in future sites and infrastructure which creates more jobs and economic activity locally.

Based in Oxford, the Vaccines Manufacturing Innovation Centre will help to tackle disease worldwide as well as further boosting the growth of the UK’s £70 billion life sciences industry.

Business Secretary Greg Clark said:

More than 200 years ago the UK pioneered the first vaccine and with it, smallpox was eradicated. Now as the world is threatened by killers such as Ebola and Lassa fever we will build on our significant heritage and history to fight against them with our unmatched reputation for medical research and innovation.

The government is investing in pioneering vaccine manufacturing as part of our modern Industrial Strategy to create more highly skilled jobs, place the NHS at the forefront of cutting-edge technologies and deliver the biggest increase in public investment in research and development in UK history.

The availability of safe, effective and economical vaccines is an important pillar of world health. Alongside more familiar diseases, populations globally are threatened by new outbreaks of diseases such as Ebola and Lassa fever. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example, an outbreak of Ebola beginning last August has resulted in 357 confirmed cases and 186 deaths, while this year a Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria has resulted in 553 confirmed cases and 143 deaths. There are presently no licensed vaccines available for these diseases.

The UK’s world-leading research and innovation expertise is ideally placed to create new, cost-effective ways of developing and manufacturing vaccines for global distribution, as well as ensuring the UK’s own preparedness in the event of a pandemic. The centre is expected to open in 2022, with the first products from the centre expected later that year.

Public Health Minister Steve Brine said:

It is no exaggeration to say that vaccines are a modern marvel and their introduction catapulted our healthcare system years ahead. Just this year we celebrated 50 years on from the introduction of the measles vaccine, which has potentially averted 20 million measles cases and 4,500 deaths.

While all vaccines save millions of lives around the world every year, we cannot get complacent. There are still too many debilitating diseases that take thousands of lives each year – but through investments like this we can strengthen our efforts and stop more diseases in their tracks.

UK Research and Innovation Chief Executive Professor Sir Mark Walport said:

Improving the development, production and application of new vaccines against infectious diseases requires expertise and collaboration across academia and industry.

The Vaccines Manufacturing Centre will play an important role in bringing expertise from industry and academia together to ensure we are prepared to respond to the threats of serious infections, including viruses with the potential to cause major national or global epidemics.

Led by the Jenner Institute, a partnership between the University of Oxford and the Pirbright Institute, the new centre has been awarded funding byUK Research and Innovationof £66 million through the UK government’s Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund (ISCF) Medicines Manufacturing challenge.

Jenner Institute Director, Professor Adrian Hill, said:

This is an exceptional opportunity for the UK to lead in the provision of vaccines against a wide range of outbreak pathogens which threaten to cause major epidemics. The lack of commercial incentive to develop these has now led to this exceptional partnership of major academic and industrial players in the vaccine field, to accelerate a range of vaccines towards large-scale manufacture and stockpile provision for vulnerable populations.

In parallel, the Centre will develop innovative manufacturing technologies with UK companies and universities to support the next generation of life-saving preventive and therapeutic vaccines.

The Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund aims to bring together the UK’s world-leading research with business to meet the major industrial and societal challenges of our time, backed by the biggest increase in public research and development investment in UK history. The investment marks a significant step in delivering on a major commitment in the Life Sciences Sector Deal, a partnership between government and industry ensuring the UK remains at the forefront of developing innovative new treatments and medical technologies to improve patients’ lives.

Additional funding of £10 million will come from commercial and other partners, including Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. and Merck Sharp and Dohme. The centre will be further supported by expertise and training from GE Healthcare.

The core research teams will be drawn from academia and industry and will include significant new contributions from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and Imperial College London as well as the University of Oxford. The programme will also benefit from access to technologies and intellectual property created by the partners.",Cities and Local Government Devolution Bill,Legislative,,id25_896

Each area has submitted ambitious proposals to take control of how public money is spent in their local area, the Prime Minister announced today (11 September 2015).

Earlier this summer the Chancellor asked areas to put forward proposals to follow in the footsteps of Greater Manchester’s ground-breaking devolution deal with government last year.

The volume of bids clearly demonstrates the significant appetite to be part of a devolution revolution across the country, with local leaders signing up in droves to the Chancellor’s vision of an accountable elected mayor leading strong regional areas who look after their own affairs.

Bids have come in from the length and breadth of the country including Liverpool City Region, the North East, Gloucestershire and the West Midlands.

The 38 bids received ahead of the deadline last Friday include the application for powers in a wide range of spending areas including education, transport, healthcare, housing and business support.

Speaking today Prime Minister David Cameron said:

Spreading opportunity, increasing social mobility, helping people get on – these aims run through this government like letters through a stick of rock.

The best businesses would never shy away from allowing their customers to shape the way they improve their services. If we are bold enough, government can go one better by actually putting many of those services in the hands of local people. It is also a proven reality that money spent closer to people is often money spent wiser – so we can really deliver more for less.

Chancellor George Osborne said:

Earlier this summer I asked local leaders to come forward with their ideas to build on our radical devolution plans. We have had hugely ambitious proposals from all over the country showing that local areas are as enthusiastic as I am about shifting power out of Whitehall.

What we are delivering in the Northern Powerhouse through our ground-breaking deal with Greater Manchester illustrates what can be achieved by working together - the challenge is now to make this happen in other great cities.

Communities Secretary Greg Clark said:

This ‘one nation government’ is determined to ensure power is devolved from Whitehall to town halls, to put an end to the old north-south divide and rebalance our economy.

The sheer volume of bids we’ve received, from cities and counties, demonstrates how local leaders are embracing this opportunity to have a direct hand in shaping the future of their area, whether in skills, transport, housing or healthcare.

I look forward to us working with each of these areas in the coming weeks and months to turn their proposals into reality.

Successful future deals from the proposals announced today will be supported through theCities and Local Government Devolution Billcurrently passing through Parliament. The proposals will now be considered as part of the Spending Review process.

The Bill puts in place the legal framework across the country that will make it simpler for devolving more powers to more places and sets out far reaching powers to be devolved to Greater Manchester and for creating a city-wide elected metro mayor.

The full list of areas submitting proposals for devolution deals is below. It includes areas who have already agreed deals seeking further devolved powers. Besides the proposals listed below, government also received a number of other representations and letters of support related to devolution, all of which will be considered carefully.

Two Local Net Zero Accelerator pilots in the Greater Manchester Combined Authority and the West Midlands Combined Authority will help drive investment in multiple green projects across key sectors such as energy, housing and transport - essential to delivering on the UK’s climate targets.

The combined authorities will decide how to allocate funding, selecting projects that will benefit their communities. These could include housing retrofit and renewable energy and transport projects, such as installing solar panels, battery storage and deploying green buses – all of which could help significantly cut emissions.

Councils have previously faced barriers to attracting private sector investment in smaller net zero programmes and one-off projects. But today’s funding is designed to tackle this so they can secure investment at scale to deliver a range of green initiatives and expand decarbonisation work in the years to come.

By combining multiple green projects across different sectors, rather than requesting funding for one-off, short-term projects, the new Local Net Zero Accelerator Programme will make it easier to secure private investment in a long-term, sustainable way.

A third, separate pilot will be launched in the York and North Yorkshire Combined Authority, with the aim of replicating a similar, successful model in Bristol, which supported around 1,000 jobs. Bristol City Leap established an innovative public-private partnership between Bristol City Council, Ameresco Ltd and Vattenfall Heat UK, which helped secure millions of pounds worth of investment into Bristol’s energy system, including solar, wind, heat networks, heat pumps and energy efficiency measures across the council’s estate.

Minister for Energy Efficiency and Green Finance, Lord Callanan, said:

The UK is a world leader when it comes to tackling climate change. But the work we do locally is just as important for cutting emissions and delivering net zero.

These pilots will help combined authorities to unlock private sector investment that they can spend on green projects they see fit locally, whether that be retrofitting housing or investing in green public transport networks – all while supporting skilled jobs, building out supply chains and growing our economy.

Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, Gareth Davies, said:

Our £19 million investment is helping local governments explore new ways to fast-track our ambitious net zero objectives.

This initiative is pivotal in mobilising the money we need to transition and boosting green jobs and investments across the country.

Mayor of the West Midlands and chair of the West Midlands Combined Authority, Andy Street, said:

The government’s decision to ask our region to help lead the drive to net zero represents a real vote of confidence in what we can do and indeed are already doing here in the West Midlands.

Whether it’s the strides we’re making to retrofit homes - making them warmer and more energy efficient - or cutting energy bills for local businesses or indeed ensuring our transport network is more sustainable, we’re taking the practical steps on the ground to advance the net zero cause.

Together, we can help draw in the required public and private finance that will accelerate the rollout and take up of net zero related projects right across the UK as a whole.

Green City Lead for Greater Manchester, Councillor Tom Ross, said:

We welcome the £7 million funding to accelerate our net zero ambitions across Greater Manchester over the next 2 years. Greater Manchester has established Local Area Energy Plans which identify the £12.5 billion of investment in infrastructure required, that is substantially under local authorities influence, to achieve our carbon neutral ambitions by 2038.

This Accelerator funding from government will be used to design investment models to attract private investment – which is scalable, replicable and which leads to securing investment partners capable of delivering at scale.

The 3 new schemes will be supported by a centralised finance service. Supported by around £3 million, this will give the pilots access to financial and commercial knowledge to attract private investment in the local programmes.

Meanwhile, the Greater South East Local Net Zero Hub will receive an extra £2 million to ensure independent oversight and the successful delivery of the 3 pilot schemes. The Net Zero Hubs programme was set up in 2017 and supports combined authorities to develop net zero projects and attract commercial investment.

The lessons learnt from these pilots will be used to support other combined authorities across England deliver on net zero targets.",Restrictions to student visa routes,Legislative,,id25_899

Includes a new Digital Skills Partnership and bold new pledges for millions of free digital training opportunities

Backs the UK digital sectors to invest for the long term and includes measures to help all businesses harness the productivity benefits of digital innovation

More than four million free digital skills training opportunities will be created as part of aDigital Strategyto make Britain the best place in the world to start and grow a digital business and ensure our digital economy works for everyone.

A pioneering new Digital Skills Partnership will see Government, business, charities and voluntary organisations coming together to make sure people have the right skills for the jobs in their area and are aware of all the digital training opportunities on offer. This Government-led initiative will help both businesses and individuals and make sure no one is left behind.

The strategy includes new commitments, including a plan by Lloyds Banking Group to give face-to-face digital skills training to 2.5 million individuals, charities and small and medium businesses by 2020; plans by Barclays to teach basic coding to 45,000 more children and assist up to one million people with general digital skills and cyber awareness; and a pledge by Google, as part of their commitment of five hours of free digital skills for everyone, to help boost digital skills in seaside towns.

It is part of the Government’s ambitions to ensure everyone has the skills they need to flourish in a digitally-driven economy.

The strategy follows the recent modernIndustrial Strategy, and will help Britain to build on its strengths to secure a future as a competitive, global nation.

Businesses have played an important role developing the strategy. To capitalise on these new relationships and deliver a thriving, outward-looking digital economy, the strategy also sets out plans to empower innovative businesses and deliver world-class connectivity. This includes:

The creation of five international tech hubs in emerging markets to create and develop partnerships between UK companies and local tech firms. These hubs will help provide British businesses with a global competitive edge and drive collaboration on skills, innovation, technology, and research and development. The hubs will be based upon the successful UK-Israel Tech Hub which to date has delivered more than 80 partnerships with a deal value of £62 million.

A new competition to spark the development of new FinTech products that can support those who struggle to access financial services and provide consumers with the tools they need to manage their finances well. This will build on the UK’s existing lead in the FinTech sector, which was worth more than £6.6bn in 2015, and make sure the digital economy works for all, not just the privileged few.

A commitment to create a Secretary of State-led forum for government and the tech community to work together to spark growth in the digital economy - through innovation and the adoption of digital in the wider economy.

A Business Connectivity Forum, to be chaired by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, to bring together business organisations, local authorities and communications providers to help businesses access fast, affordable and reliable broadband.

Confirmation of £1billion programme to keep Britain at the forefront of digital connectivity,announced at Autumn Statement. This funding will accelerate the development and uptake of next generation digital infrastructure - including full fibre broadband plans and 5G.

Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport Karen Bradley said:

The UK’s world-leading digital sectors are a major driver of growth and productivity, and we are determined to protect and strengthen them.

This Digital Strategy sets a path to make Britain the best place to start and grow a digital business, trial a new technology, or undertake advanced research as part of the Government’s plan to build a modern, dynamic and global trading nation.

To do that, we will work closely with businesses and others to make sure the benefits and opportunities are spread across the country so nobody is left behind.

There should be no digital divide - every individual and every business should have the skills and confidence to make the most of digital technology and have easy access to high-quality internet wherever they live, work, travel or learn.

At the heart of the strategy are steps to ensure everyone can develop the skills they need to thrive in an increasingly digital world and measures to help businesses harness the benefits of innovation.

Government has taken the lead in this area and has committed to help adults who lack core digital skills to access training free of charge, similar to the approach taken for literacy and numeracy. The strategy builds on this by establishing a Digital Skills Partnership and, as part of the Digital Strategy, Government has secured the following new pledges from private sector organisations:

Google will launch a Summer of Skills programme in coastal towns across the UK. It will develop bespoke digital skills training schemes to help boost tourism and growth in seaside towns.

Lloyds Banking Group is to give face-to-face digital skills training to 2.5 million individuals, small and medium businesses and charities by 2020. The training, as part of its Helping Britain Prosper Plan, will include internet banking.

Barclays will assist up to 1 million people with general digital skills and cyber awareness in 2017, grow its UK Eagle Lab network by up to 100 per cent, and teach basic coding to 45,000 children.

BT will expand its Barefoot Computing Project to enable a further 500,000 children to develop early computational thinking skills by the end of the 2017/18 academic year. The scheme helps primary school teachers with no previous computer science background feel confident to teach the new computing science curriculum.

The HP Foundation will bring a free online learning platform - HP LIFE - to the UK. This will improve business, IT and digital skills for disadvantaged groups in the UK and aims to reach 6,000 new UK users over the next five years.

Accenture will partner with FutureLearn to develop a new national digital skills programme to boost learning through online collaboration. Through partners, the programme could reach as many as 100,000 people across the UK.

Josh Hardie, CBI Deputy Director-General, said:

UK companies are at the forefront of the digital revolution. The pledges announced by the Government underline businesses’ commitment to build the skills we need for a modern economy, as well as tackle barriers to technology adoption.

To uphold our position as a world-leading digital economy businesses, we and the Government need to work together - the strategy’s focus on skills, connectivity and innovation provide a useful framework for this.

Gerard Grech, chief executive, Tech City UK, said:

The UK’s tech sector is rapidly becoming a global force to reckon with, but we must ensure that we stay ahead by continuing to provide a supportive environment for British startups and digital companies to grow in, especially since other countries are trying to take advantage of our departure from the European Union. In the UK tech sector jobs are being created at twice the rate of the wider economy, and today’s Digital Strategy provides an ambitious road map for the industry to continue growing at this rate and building a new economy fit for the future.

Nick Williams, Managing Director, Consumer and Commercial Digital at Lloyds Banking Group, said:

I’m delighted that Lloyds Banking Group, as part of its new Helping Britain Prosper Plan, has made such a significant commitment to improve digital skills in the UK. By working with the Digital Skills Partnership, and our key partners such as Google and The Good Things Foundation, we can help to tackle some of the issues raised by the Government’s Digital Strategy. Our commitment to provide face-to-face support will make a huge difference to millions of individuals, small businesses and charities across the UK.

Ronan Harris, Google Managing Director UK & Ireland, said:

We believe that digital can have a transformative impact, no matter where you live and what your job is. Everyone deserves access to the tools and opportunities the web has to offer and that is why we welcome the Government’s timely Digital Strategy which ensures the benefits of the digital economy are spread across the country.

We are delighted to be part of the Digital Skills Partnership and will continue to invest in the free skills training offered through the Digital Garage, launch a new programme aiming to help seaside communities, and - as a global first - are launching engineering apprenticeships, giving young people without a degree the opportunity to join Google’s world class software teams.

The strategy also contains new measures to support Britain’s world leading AI sector which were announced earlier this week.

A major AI review led by Wendy Hall and Jérôme Pesenti to identify the critical elements for this exciting technology to thrive and grow in the UK. It will consider how Government and industry could work together to back this technology, with the aim of establishing the potential for a possible sector deal. The UK is already a world-leader in the science underpinning this technology and the sector has the potential to grow further, from early research to commercialisation.

A funding boost of £17.3 million from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) to support the development of new robotics and artificial intelligence technologies in universities across the UK.

The strategy also builds on theGovernment Transformation Strategy, launched earlier this month by Minister for the Cabinet Office Ben Gummer, which maps out how Government will transform the relationship between the citizen and the state to improve public services. This has ambitions to make it as easy to renew your passport or report a crime as it is to buy a book online, and aims to sign up to 25 million people onto the Government identity service Verify by 2020.

International students starting courses this month will no longer be able to bring family members on all but postgraduate research courses and courses with government-funded scholarships. The changes, first announced last May, have also seen people banned from using the student visa as a backdoor route to work in the UK and will see an estimated 140,000 fewer people come to the UK.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated that net migration was 672,000 from June 2022 to June 2023. In the year ending September 2023, 152,980 visas were issued to dependants of students, a more than 930% rise from the 14,839 in the year ending September 2019.

The changes to student dependant rules are part of a wider package of measures to come into force that will drastically bring down the high numbers of migrants coming to the UK to sustainable levels, and crack down on those who take advantage of the flexibility of the UK’s immigration system.

Home Secretary James Cleverly said:

This government is delivering on its commitment to the British public to cut migration. We have set out a tough plan to rapidly bring numbers down, control our borders and prevent people from manipulating our immigration system, which will come into force throughout this year.

Yesterday, a major part of that plan came into effect, ending the unreasonable practice of overseas students bringing their family members to the UK. This will see migration falling rapidly by the tens of thousands and contribute to our overall strategy to prevent 300,000 people from coming to the UK.

Tom Pursglove MP, Minister for Legal Migration and the Border, said:

Our world-leading universities rightly attract some of the brightest students from around the world to the UK. But we have seen a surge in the number of dependants being brought by students, which is contributing to unsustainable levels of migration.

We are completely committed to seeing a decisive cut in migration. The action implemented yesterday to restrict bringing dependants on the student visa route allows us to better protect our public services, while supporting the economy by allowing the students who contribute the most to keep coming here.

This is part of a series of measures which together will see 300,000 fewer people coming to the UK compared to last year.

At the same time, the government is stopping the boats and tackling illegal migration. Small boat arrivals to the UK are down 35% this year, illegal working raids have increased by 70%, migration agreements have been signed with France, Bulgaria, Turkey, Italy, Georgia and Ethiopia, more than 5,000 Albanians have been returned and arrivals from Albania are down by 90%. This is on top of signing a new treaty with the government of Rwanda and introducing new legislation making it clear that Rwanda is a safe country and allowing asylum seekers to be relocated there as a safe third country.

The changes to student visas strike the right balance to continue to preserve the attractiveness of the UK’s world-leading higher education sector, while removing the ability for institutions to undermine the UK’s reputation by selling immigration not education.

The government remains committed to the International Education Strategy which recognises the important benefits that international students bring to the UK, including the economic contribution they make. This means balancing the commitment to lower overall levels of migration with ensuring those coming to the UK are highly skilled and provide the most benefit to our economy.

The government will work with universities to design an alternative approach, in order to continue to attract the brightest and the best to the UK, and so they can bring dependents to the UK’s world-leading universities, while continuing to reduce net migration.

In December, the Home Secretary announced a further set of measures to bring legal migration down to sustainable levels. This includes ending the abuse of health and care visas by stopping overseas care workers from bringing dependants, and requiring care firms in England to be regulated by the Care Quality Commission in order to sponsor visas.

Salary thresholds across the skilled worker route will also be increased by nearly 50% to £38,700, while the government is also cracking down on cut-price labour from overseas by scrapping the 20% salary discount for shortage occupations and replacing the Shortage Occupation List.

The minimum income requirement for British or settled people sponsoring family members to join them in the UK will also be increased to £38,700 by Spring 2025, while the Migration Advisory Committee will be commissioned to review the Graduate route to prevent abuse and ensure the integrity and quality of the UK higher education system is maintained.

This package of measures, taken in addition with the measures on student dependants, means that around 300,000 people who came to the UK last year would not be able to in the future – the largest reduction ever. This is a tough but fair approach to bring net migration down to sustainable levels as soon as possible, while ensuring those affected have ample time to prepare for upcoming changes – with the package being introduced gradually throughout early 2024.",Statement of Mutual Cooperation (SMC),Informational,,id25_901

The Independent Chief Inspector made a follow-up visit to Napier Barracks on 4 March.

HMIPis producing a detailed written report, which the Independent Chief Inspector will append to ICIBI’s full inspection report on completion of this inspection. As well as Penally Camp and Napier Barracks, ICIBI’s report will cover hotels and any other forms of contingency asylum accommodation. ICIBI’s report and recommendations will be submitted to the Home Secretary and published in the usual way. Meanwhile, the points below, which have been shared with the Home Office, provide a high-level overview of what inspectors found during their site visits. The headings are those typically used by HMIP.

ICIBI’s inspection of contingency asylum accommodation is ongoing and inspectors are continuing to gather, analyse and test written and oral evidence from the Home Office, the contracted third parties, national and local stakeholders, and asylum seekers who are or have been in contingency accommodation. While the public ‘call for evidence’ has closed, ICIBI is still keen to receive evidence, including the latest information, about contingency asylum accommodation in general and about specific sites, including Penally Camp and Napier Barracks.

Opening Penally Camp and Napier Barracks as contingency asylum accommodation, particularly doing so safely during a pandemic, presented substantial logistical and other challenges. Despite this, the Home Office gave its accommodation contractors less than two weeks to make each site operational.

The resources, skills and assurance systems required to support long-term communal accommodation were inadequate at both sites:

Texas has the second largest US state economy, with a GDP of £1.9 trillion in 2022 – larger than Italy, making this the UK’s most economically significant trade pact with a US state to date.

The pact aims to help make it quicker, easier, and cheaper for UK and Texas firms to do business by tackling trade barriers, growing investment, and driving commerce between the UK and Texas.

The UK is Texas’ 8th largest international goods export market, with total trade in goods already worth £14.7 billion in 2023. The top products being exported to Texas include nuclear equipment, aircraft, and pharmaceutical products.

This arrangement is targeted at sectors where the UK and Texas have shared expertise such as new energy solutions - including hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation, and storage, life sciences, and professional business services.

The signing comes just four months on from agreeing the UK-Florida Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), bringing the number of agreements with US states up to eight – worth a combined GDP of £5.3 trillion, which is greater than that of Japan and equivalent to a quarter of the US economy.

I’m delighted to welcome Governor Abbott to the UK for this landmark signing.

Today’s signature with Texas marks the UK’s eighth US state-level pact, meaning UK firms now have access to states with a combined GDP of £5.3 trillion - equivalent to a quarter of the whole US economy. This shows our US state-level strategy is working and really delivering for British businesses.

Prioritising cooperation on innovative energy solutions such as hydrogen will help the UK to go further in achieving its aim to unlock more than 12,000 jobs and up to £11 billion of investment by 2030 in the hydrogen sector.

The UK Government’s landmark ‘BioBridge’ collaboration with the Texas Medical Center, the world’s largest medical complex, has already supported more than 30 innovative UK life sciences companies to grow their businesses in Texas - this SMC will help deepen economic ties in this critical sector even further.

The pact will also support recognition of professional qualifications. Texas is already signed up to the mutual recognition agreement for architects which UK and US bodies concluded last year, and there is ongoing work towards a similar agreement for engineering.

As our ninth largest trade partner, the United Kingdom plays a critical role in the Texas economic juggernaut.

Strengthening the bond between Texas and the United Kingdom is crucial for our shared economies to prosper.

By signing this Statement of Mutual Cooperation today, we will further promote economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic. Texas is the economic engine of America, where entrepreneurs from around the globe can cast a vision and know they can achieve it. Working with our British partners, we will chart a greater path towards success and opportunity and create an even more robust economic partnership.

We are thrilled to hear that the UK and Texas have signed a SMC to enhance trade and economic development ties. We have been working in Texas since 2013, setting up our US HQ in Houston in the heart of the Texas Medical Center. This dynamic state is one of our largest US markets, representing 20% of our $10m business.

As a UK business with our US Headquarters in Houston, we are delighted with the news that the UK-Texas SMC has been signed. This will help to strengthen ties with this key US state and help Concrete Canvas achieve our ambitions for further growth and investment across the US.

UK companies are already making use of close UK-US trading ties, thanks to MoUs already signed. For example, leading innovator in surgical training technologies Merseyside-based Inovus Medical launched their US HQ in Tampa Bay in December 2023 – just one month after signature of the UK-Florida MoU. By choosing Florida as its US base in light of its robust healthcare ecosystem and thriving innovation and technology status, Innovus Medical has seen significant growth in the US.

Adults without an A-Level or equivalent qualification will be offered a free, fully-funded college course – providing them with skills valued by employers, and the opportunity to study at a time and location that suits them.

This offer will be available from April in England, and will be paid for through the National Skills Fund. A full list of available courses will be set out shortly.

Higher education loans will also be made more flexible, allowing adults and young people to space out their study across their lifetimes, take more high-quality vocational courses in further education colleges and universities, and to support people to retrain for jobs of the future.

These reforms will be backed by continued investment in college buildings and facilities – including over £1.5 billion in capital funding. More details will be set out in a further education white paper later this year.

The coronavirus pandemic and changing economy is why the Prime Minister is developing a long-term plan to ensure that, as work changes, people can retrain, upskill and find new well-paid jobs.

In a speech on Tuesday, the Prime Minister is expected to announce a new Lifetime Skill Guarantee. He will say:

As the Chancellor has said, we cannot, alas, save every job. What we can do is give people the skills to find and create new and better jobs.

So my message today is that at every stage of your life, this government will help you get the skills you need.

He will add:

We’re transforming the foundations of the skills system so that everyone has the chance to train and retrain.

Apprenticeship opportunities will also be increased, with more funding for SMEs taking on apprentices, and greater flexibility in how their training is structured – especially in sectors such as construction and creative industries where there are more varied employment patterns.

In 2000, over 100,000 people were doing Higher National Certificates and Diplomas, but that has reduced to fewer than 35,000 now. Those doing foundation degrees has declined from 81,000 to 30,000.

As a result, only 10% of adults hold a Higher Technical Qualification as their highest qualification, compared to 20% in Germany and 34% in Canada.

This is despite the fact that five years after completion, the average Higher Technical Apprentice earns more than the average graduate.

That is why the government is committed to making higher education more flexible to facilitate lifelong learning, and to make it easy for adults and young people to break up their study into segments, transfer credits between colleges and universities, and enable more part-time study.

This new arrangement will provide finance for shorter term studies, rather than having to study in one three or four year block.

The government is also committing £8 million for digital skills boot camps; expanding successful pilots in Greater Manchester and the West Midlands and introducing programmes in four new locations.

From next year, boot camps will be extended to sectors like construction and engineering, helping the country build back better and support our refreshed Industrial Strategy.

Earlier this year the government launched its free online Skills Toolkit, helping people train in digital and numeracy skills. This is being expanded today to include 62 additional courses.

£2.5 billion is also being made available through the National Skills Fund to help get people working again after COVID, as well as giving those in work the chance to train for higher-skilled, better-paid jobs.

BT welcomes the Prime Minister’s commitment to put skills at the heart of the COVID-19 recovery plan, and particularly the emphasis on digital skills.  BT is already heavily invested in this area through Skills for Tomorrow which aims to empower 10 million people by giving them the skills they need to make the most of life in a digital world. Our Work Ready programme, and our support for the new Fast Futures digital courses for young adults, focus on the jobseeker groups that most need new skills. Ensuring that the nation’s workforce is ready for a digital future has never been more urgent – and partnership is key. That’s why BT is a founding partner of FutureDotNow, a coalition which aims to motivate people and businesses across the UK to address the growing skills gap and empower everyone to thrive in a digital UK.

We welcome this initiative to help the country recover from the impact of the pandemic by equipping people with the skills needed to find new jobs and retrain for new opportunities. At Amazon, we continue to provide opportunities for people of all ages to gain new skills with apprenticeships and university bursaries, free computer science and engineering resources through our Amazon Future Engineer and Maths4All programmes, and free training for small businesses through the Amazon Small Business Accelerator. Amazon also offers employees a programme called Career Choice that provides funding for skills development through nationally recognised courses of up to £8,000 over four years.

Given the pace of change in business and in workplaces today, and the economic challenges of COVID, we welcome the Prime Minister’s announcements today to not just rebuild, but to turbo charge skills training in England. The new Skills and Productivity Board has a key role to play in developing our skills economy for current and future generations. It is a privilege to contribute, and I’m looking forward to working with the panel and the government to drive this important agenda. The Skills Productivity Board will provide important advice to government on how to tackle the nation’s skills challenges to help rebuild our economy post-COVID-19 and deliver the bold skills agenda outlined by the Prime Minister today. I look forward to working with government to level up opportunity across the country ensuring people have the skills they need to progress.

As a country we face multiple challenges, but we believe that learning unlocks opportunity. Today, more than ever, individuals, businesses and government must build the skills we need for tomorrow. Because if we fail to act now, the UK could easily be left behind in the global economy. There are no better investments in our future than the kinds of accessible, lifelong and flexible programmes that the Prime Minister has announced this morning.

It’s more important than ever that government and industry work together to help young people and adults gain the skills needed to work in sectors which will support our nation’s economic recovery. As a major employer of graduates and apprentices, BAE Systems’ investment in skills provides an essential pipeline of talent that enables us to continue to deliver cutting-edge defence and security capabilities, essential to our national security.

We welcome the Prime Minister’s announcement of increased funding for skills and further education. As a business we are passionate about improving social mobility and developing the skills of the nation’s young people to ensure they are ready for work. That is why we invest heavily in apprenticeships, supporting over 12,500 since 2011.

With digitisation accelerating throughout the economy, the UK needs to continue to develop a highly skilled and innovative workforce. Banks can play a critical role, and Citi looks forward to expanding the reach of its current apprenticeship programmes, including our recently-launched Data Academy and efforts to encourage former employees back into the workforce. Citi stands ready to play its part in delivering on the UK Government’s ambition to increase employability and transform the country’s training and skills system.

The Prime Minister’s announcement today to transform the training and skills system is crucial to helping businesses get back on their feet and start to realise future opportunities. These are tough times for small businesses and skills are a vital part of the recovery process.

The Co-op Group is pleased to work in partnership with the government to create opportunities for adults to gain the skills they need to move into sustainable employment. We are already an industry leader in providing apprenticeships and we are proud of the work our 1,200 current apprentices have done as key workers during the pandemic to support the nation.

We believe that opportunities need to be created where they are most needed and offered to those who most need them. So we have already committed to ensure that groups that have previously been under-represented in our apprenticeship programme receive fair access in the future so we are seeking partnerships focussed on benefitting Black, Asian and ethnic minority candidates. We also know there is more to do to ensure opportunities to develop new skills are made available in the communities that most need them. That’s why we have committed to offer up to 150 kickstarter placements – combining skills and paid employment - in communities where we know the need is greatest.

We welcome today’s announcement by the Prime Minister. As future technologies increase the need for digital and electrical skills in the automotive industry, Jaguar Land Rover supports any measures aimed at up-skilling and re-skilling our employees as a part of a lifelong approach to learning.

As the largest UK automotive apprenticeship provider, we invest heavily in the training and development of our people throughout their careers.

A notification system between BT, the emergency services and UK government has been put in place to ensure all Ambulance Trusts, Police Forces, Fire and Rescue Service and HM Coastguard can rapidly enact a coordinated response.

In the unlikely event of a future incident, the government would also issue public advice on what to do to continue to reach the emergency services.

The new measures come as the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology has today (21 March 2024) published a review into the extremely rare incident which occurred last July and established six recommendations to bolster the robustness of the system.

While the emergency call service has historically proven itself to be very resilient, the review represents an important move to ensure any potential future risks to the public are minimised.

The most pressing recommendation has already been completed, with BT implementing immediate improvements to its systems to prevent similar future occurrences.

In the immediate aftermath of the event, BT launched a comprehensive investigation into the fault and published their report on 29 June 23, taking full responsibility for the disruption and recognising the critical national importance their 999 infrastructure plays.

Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology Michelle Donelan said:

The incident in June of last year marked the first significant disruption to the 999 system in nearly 90 years. We are determined to prevent history from repeating itself, with public safety being absolutely paramount.

This is why, following a thorough review of the incident, we are working with BT to establish enhanced resilience measures, ensuring the UK is always prepared to effectively address major emergencies.

The government remains steadfast in its commitment to safeguarding the public’s safety and well-being.

Alongside measures to improve risk management and communications, the new recommendations focus on enhancing the UK government’s oversight during potential future incidents.

The Cabinet Office will coordinate efforts to instil greater clarity on responsibilities and accountability for the 999 system’s resilience to a range of challenges. These include cyber-attacks, natural disasters, high numbers of calls, and simultaneous incidents, ensuring the system is robust and can effectively respond to a wide range of emergency scenarios in the future.

These improvements will be made by testing of the government’s 999 Strategic Incident Group – a dedicated cross-system incident notification and response protocol - and establish guidance to help emergency services and the government communicate with the public during call system incidents.

To further enhance public awareness and preparedness, a cross-government communication plan will also be developed by the end of April, creating a central point of public advice for various scenarios involving potential disruptions to 999 calls and covering all four nations of the UK.

The review has drawn on the evidence and expertise of all relevant stakeholders, including Emergency Authorities, BT,Ofcom, government departments, the Devolved Administrations, and Local Resilience Forums.

All recommendations are to be implemented by the end of April 2024.

Howard Watson, Chief Security and Networks Officer, BT Group, said:

At BT Group we take great pride in underpinning the national 999 service and recognise the critical importance our infrastructure plays. The level of disruption to the service on Sunday 25 June 2023 has never been seen before and we are sincerely sorry for the distress caused.

While no technology is 100% resilient, we have built a highly robust network with multiple layers of protection to connect the public to blue light services in their time of need. We take our responsibility to the emergency services and the public seriously, and on this occasion we fell short of our own high standards for the 999 service.

As outlined in the government’s Post-Incident Review (PIR), we have put in place a comprehensive improvement plan to prevent this series of events reoccurring. We are also committed to working with all 999 stakeholders to continue to improve end-to-end resilience of the system.

Chair of the 999/112 Liaison Committee and Assistant Chief Constable Catherine Akehurst said:

I welcome the findings of the review, which has had public safety at the forefront. Although this incident was extremely rare it is essential that we learn the lessons from it, and the review’s recommendations will further strengthen arrangements across the country. This includes coordination across all partners in the system - across BT, the Emergency Authorities around the country, and government - to ensure public can continue to access the emergency services whenever they need to.

The UK government will continue to work closely with BT and industry stakeholders to provide reliable access to the UKs emergency services. The recommendations detailed in the review will be overseen by senior government officials to ensure the continued resilience of the Public Emergency Call Service.

Read the full review into the 999 system here.

Following the unprecedented fault on the 999 technical infrastructure last July, the emergency authorities did not identify any confirmed cases of serious harm occurring as a direct result of the incident.

BT launched a comprehensive investigation into the fault and published their report on 29 July 2023.

Ofcom, as the independent regulator for the communications sector, opened up the technical investigation into of BT’s compliance with their regulatory obligations in connection with theincident on the 29 June 2023, we expect this to be released in the coming months.","Legislative (laws, regulations, statutory changes)",Legislative,,id25_905

Space Forge, based in South Wales, is building the world’s first in-space manufacturing platform that can be returned back to Earth and has been awarded £499,000 as part of a collaborative project with Northrop Grumman under the MOD’s Defence Technology Exploitation Programme (DTEP).

With multiple benefits, materials manufactured in space are especially pure because of access to extreme temperatures and lack of contamination.

This manufacturing includes semiconductors, which are crucial components of radars and frontline battlefield communications systems. Space Forge’s innovative work could see the revolution of UK defence supply chains as they deliver for our Armed Forces.

Part of a wider scheme, DTEP funding is designed to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across the UK to develop innovative materials, technologies and processes to enhance defence supply chains. DTEP aims to inspire companies to win new business, develop industrial capabilities, and provide new cutting-edge answers to defence problems at home and abroad.

Through DTEP funding, Space Forge will provide innovative solutions to Defence problems using cutting-edge science, and will also support highly-skilled jobs to the South Wales community, levelling up and supporting the Prime Minister’s priority to grow the economy.

Demonstrating the UK government’s commitment to working with small businesses across Defence, the Minister for Defence Procurement, James Cartlidge, also hosted a range of British small businesses in Cardiff today who are paving the way in new age defence capabilities.

The work taking place at Space Forge, and other SMEs, is paramount to the success of our future operations. We are committed to supporting their endeavours to ensure our defence capabilities remain at the forefront of technological innovation.

This visit reinforces our dedication to fostering partnerships with leading institutions, who drive innovation in the defence sector and keep our Armed Forces equipped with the most modern capabilities.

SMEs hold a crucial place in the UK defence enterprise, play an important role in sustaining industrial capability and are vital to delivering our defence aspirations. They also provide hugely important expertise and support a wide variety of high-quality jobs across the UK.

This is an incredibly exciting partnership for Space Forge, to be working with Northrop Grumman to secure defence supply chains for the Ministry of Defence is an important step in demonstrating the utility of in-space manufacturing. National security is shared security and this Atlantic partnership is a keystone in building new capabilities and prosperity.

During his visit, Defence Minister Cartlidge engaged in discussions with leading experts at Space Forge to gain insight into the latest developments in space capabilities.

The Online Safety Bill yesterday (Thursday 26 October)received Royal Assent, heralding a new era of internet safety and choice by placing world-first legal duties on social media platforms.

The new laws take a zero-tolerance approach to protecting children from online harm, while empowering adults with more choices over what they see online. This follows rigorous scrutiny and extensive debate in Parliament.

A raft of voices below have thrown their support behind the Act, ranging from groups representing children’s voices, women’s rights and consumer rights.

Andrea Simon, Director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition said:

Along with survivors, other experts and over100,000 members of the public, we called for the Online Safety Bill to tackle and prevent violence against women and girls. We welcome this landmark new guidance for tech companies to reduce harm to women and girls online, which is a step in the right direction for tackling this abuse. But we also know that implementation and enforcement is key if we are to address the rapid spread of misogyny and online abuse, and we will work with government and Ofcom to ensure it is as robust as possible and well enforced.

Lynn PerryMBE, Chief Executive of Barnardo’s, said:

We’re delighted that the Online Safety Bill has received royal assent and will now become law. This is an important first step towards making the UK the safest place for a child to be online.

Through our frontline work across the UK, we support children whose mental health and understanding of healthy relationships are damaged by what they see online. We welcome how this bill places a duty on pornography sites to verify that users are over 18 which will help to stop children from viewing this type of harmful content.

There is much more work to be done here and we will continue to work with the government on implementing this legislation, the forthcoming review into pornography and ensuring we keep ahead of emerging online threats, such as AI, to protect our children.

William Perrin, a trustee at Carnegie UK, said:

The new Online Safety Act will bring social media companies in line with other industries by introducing a regulatory regime designed to reduce harm, particularly to children and other vulnerable groups.

An exceptionally broad coalition of more than 50 charity and civil society organisations have played a vital role in making these new laws a reality. The number of bodies making the case for these changes shows that our previous approach to social media regulation hasn’t been working and put too many people in harm’s way.

While the implementation of this new regulation will clearly be key to its success, UK lawmakers deserve credit for taking action to protect our collective wellbeing.

Imran Ahmed,CEOand founder of the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), said:

The Center for Countering Digital Hate welcomes the Online Safety Act - a momentous step towards a safer digital world.

The Online Safety Act ensures social media platforms are held responsible for the content they host, requiring platforms to remove illegal content, protect child users and empower adults with choice over the content they see. It is now up to the regulator Ofcom to enact a robust regime of oversight and enforcement alongside whichCCDHwill continue to advocate for an online world free from hate and disinformation.

Baroness Kidron, Chair of 5Rights Foundation:

I am delighted that the Online Safety Bill is now law. I congratulate the Department of Science, Innovation and Technology and pay tribute to the many organisations and individuals that have played a part, in particular the broad coalition of children’s charities and the Bereaved Families for Online Safety. The wisdom and advocacy of these groups has made for a much better law.

The mantel of responsibility for child online safety now falls firmly on the shoulders of the tech sector who under the watchful gaze Ofcom must use the Act to make meaningful changes to children’s online experiences.

This is just one small step toward building the digital world children deserve.

Rocio Concha, Which? Director of Policy and Advocacy, said:

Which? led the campaign for consumers to have stronger protections against scam adverts on social media platforms and search engines that can have devastating financial and emotional consequences for victims. These new Online Safety laws are a major step forward in the fight back against fraud by forcing tech firms to step up and take more responsibility for stopping people being targeted by fraudulent online adverts.

Ofcom must now develop codes of practice that will hold platforms to a high standard and be prepared to take strong enforcement action, including fines, against firms if they break the law.

Marc Allera,CEOBT’s Consumer brands, said:

We welcome this new legislation and hope it marks a turning point in improving safety and raising standards of behaviour online. From 5G misinformation to the way social media can perpetuate violence against women and girls, online harms have real world consequences. It’s great to see the UK leading on this and we hope others will follow.

Oliver Chantler, Head of Policy & Public Affairs at The Mental Health Foundation, said:

The Online Safety Act is hugely welcome and will help protect people’s mental health across the UK.

The online world can be a great source of support and help to people who are struggling, but as the government has recognised, it can also expose users to material which can be incredibly harmful to their mental health, including promoting eating disorders and self-harm.

This new legislation takes a proportionate approach, by giving people the tools to stay safe online and control their experience, and clamping down on the most dangerous content that is a risk to public health.

Kick It Out chair Sanjay Bhandari, speaking on behalf of English football organisations, said:

Online abuse in football has risen significantly in recent years, but new laws passed by the government should offer some hope to all those who participate in football. Change will take time, but it’s a big step in the right direction to make everyone in football feel safer online.

Ellen Miller, InterimCEOof Refuge, said:

After 2 years of tireless campaigning, Refuge is pleased to see that the Online Safety Bill has been granted Royal Assent.

We are glad that the Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology, have listened to us and other organisations in the Violence Against Women and Girls sector and that the Bill now contains specific protections for women and girls.

We are pleased to see coercive and controlling behaviour recognised as a priority offence in the Act This means social media platforms are required to respond to these abusive behaviours and take steps towards preventing them from being able to happen in the first place.

After campaigning alongside other organisations to get a ‘Violence Against Women and Girls Code of Practice’ in the Bill, including in our report “Marked as Unsafe”, Refuge welcomed the amendment requiring legislators Ofcom to publish guidance for social media platforms to make online spaces safer for women and girls. These guidelines will make it so that social media companies must make the safety of women and girls on their platforms a higher priority.

A key part of the government’s Long-Term Plan for Housing, theLeasehold and Freehold Reform Bill, introduced to Parliament today (27 November 2023), will make it easier and cheaper for leaseholders to buy their freehold, increase standard lease extension terms to 990 years for houses and flats, and provide greater transparency over service charges. The Bill will also rebalance the legal costs regime and remove barriers for leaseholders to challenge their landlords’ unreasonable charges at Tribunal.

The new powers will also help more leaseholders take over the management of their property if they wish to, instead of being stuck with the freeholder’s management choice, and we will make this process cheaper for leaseholders.

The government will also bring forward further reforms which will extend access to redress schemes and make it easier and cheaper to get the information needed to sell a leasehold home.

Ahead of the Bill’s introduction, the Housing Secretary, Michael Gove said:

People work hard to own a home. But for far too long too many have been denied the full benefits of ownership through the unfair and outdated leasehold system.

That’s why liberating leaseholders forms a vital part of the government’s Long-Term Plan for Housing.

So today marks a landmark moment for millions of leaseholders across the country, as we unveil laws to deliver significant new rights and protections, slash unfair costs and crack down on exploitation.

The Bill addresses one of the longest-term challenges that the country faces – fairness in the housing market. The measures in the Bill will put the country on the right path for the future by addressing the historic imbalances between leaseholder and freeholder to give homeowners a fairer deal, greater protections, and more rights.

The Bill will strengthen existing, and introduce new, consumer rights for homeowners by:

The government will also give greater rights to those in mixed-use blocks of flats. Currently leaseholders in these buildings are barred from taking over the management of the site or buying its freehold if more than 25% of its floor space is commercial – such as shops or offices on the ground floor. The government will now increase the floor space limit to 50%, so that more leaseholders can access the Right to Manage or the right to a collective enfranchisement.

It will also level up the rights of residents of freehold estates by granting freehold homeowners on private and mixed tenure estates the same rights of redress as leaseholders and equivalent rights to transparency over their estate charges.

The Bill will also rebalance the housing system for leaseholders by:

The Bill brought to Parliament today forms part of the government’sLong-Term Plan for Housingand delivers the government’s manifesto commitments on leasehold reform. As announced in the King’s Speech, the government will introduce some measures at first reading and others as amendments as the Bill makes its way through Parliament to deliver on the full range of commitments set out above.

These will include measures to amend the Building Safety Act 2022 to make it easier to ensure that those who caused building-safety defects in enfranchised buildings are made to pay, and that the leaseholder protections are not unfairly weighted against those who own properties jointly.

The government is also alreadyconsulting on options to cap ground rents for existing leasesthat will protect leaseholders from facing unregulated ground rents for no service in return. The consultation closes on 17 January 2024 and the government will respond shortly afterwards.

These reforms have been prepared using detailed reports to the government provided by the Law Commission and have been extensively consulted on with the sector.","Continued payment of funding for early years entitlements during nursery, preschool or childminder closures due to coronavirus.",Welfare,Financial Support,id25_908

Final request to landlords(PDF,63.1 KB,3 pages)

All Thomas Cook bookings, including flights and holidays, have now been cancelled. All of Thomas Cook’s retail shops will close with immediate effect.

The Government is working with the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to help passengers return to the UK. Depending on your location, this will be either on CAA-operated flights or by using existing flights with other airlines. This will apply to both ATOL protected passengers and those who are not protected.

If you are already abroad you, will find all the information you need about your arrangements to return to the UK on theCAA website.

If you are due to depart from a UK airport with Thomas Cook Airlines, please do not travel to your UK airport as your flight will not be operating and you will not be able to travel. Further information is available on theCAA’s website.

If you have paid the Thomas Cook companies in liquidation for goods or services that you haven’t received, you will need to register as a creditor in the liquidation.

If you have unredeemed Thomas Cook gift cards, pleaseregister as a creditor.

Further information on claiming a refund for an ATOL protected holiday is available on theCAA’s website.

If you have booked Thomas Cook flights only and are not ATOL protected, you may be able to get your money back by claiming a refund from your card issuer. Please contact your card issuer as soon as possible and further information, including time limits that apply, is available from the UK Cards Association’s Credit and debit cards: A consumer guide.

The Official Receiver is aware that Thomas Cook customers are being offered refunds in exchange for an upfront payment and bank details. Do not engage with any such approaches and report them immediately to the Official Receiver viaThomasCook.Liquidator@insolvency.gov.ukandAction Fraud UK.

If you have been told that you are being made redundant, the information in this section provides advice about claiming money you’re owed and where you can seek support.

You can apply to the Insolvency Service for redundancy and other payments if:

You can’t apply to the Insolvency Service if you live in Northern Ireland. Find out aboutyour rights in Northern Ireland if your employer is insolvent.

If you live outside of England, Scotland and Wales, and also spent the majority of your employment outside of England, Scotland, and Wales, you will need to apply to the redundancy scheme in that jurisdiction.

The Special Managers will give you details about how to apply and will also give you a case reference number (for example CN12345678).

Once you have this information you canapply online.

What you can apply for depends on your circumstances. The Insolvency Service can pay:

If you have already taken the leave you are entitled to, you will not be due a holiday pay accrued (HPA) payment

There are caps on what we can pay you for each type of claim.Find out how much we can pay you.

We process and pay HPT and HPA payments separately, so you may receive two separate letters at different times about these payments.

Some employees have received a letter telling them that they will not be paid holiday pay. This may be because the information we have so far received from Thomas Cook doesn’t say that you are owed holiday pay.  Claims rejected for this reason are being individually reviewed, without the need for re-submission and will be paid as soon as we can verify what is owed.

On average the Insolvency Service’s redundancy payments service pays redundancy and related claims within 14 days of receipt of information.

Special arrangements are being put in place to pay sooner if practicable to do so.

Find more information aboutwhat we can pay.

Employees of Thomas Cook’s airline and tour operator companies should approach AlixPartners for further information about how to make a claim via theirdedicated website.

Employees of Thomas Cook’s retail and aircraft maintenance companies should approach Interpath Advisory via thededicated websiteor via the following email addresses:

Please don’t contact us about how to claim or to check the status of your application. This will help us deal with everyone’s application as quickly as possible.

Thomas Cook Aircraft Engineering Ltd is being wound-down as part of the liquidation of the group and will close. The Special Managers will provide staff with the information they will need tomake a claim for the redundancy and other related paymentsthat are due when they are made redundant.

Thomas Cook employees not able to work on a long-term basis due to illness or incapacity who had been off work for more than six months and in receipt of income protection insurance payments were made redundant on 23 September 2019. Affected employees have been contacted by the Special Managers with information about the consequences of the liquidation for their payments.

The Official Receiver is aware that some employees have not received the insurance payment they were expecting for September and is looking into this with insurers. Former employees who have not received their September payment are advised to claim for outstanding payments from the Redundancy Payments Service.Claims are subject to statutory limits.

As Thomas Cook is now in liquidation no further income protection payments will be made by the company. Enquiries about future payments should be directed to the relevant insurance companies.

You will need toregister as a creditorin the liquidation if:

To register as a creditor you will need to complete aProof of Debt formwhich you should then email to the Special Managers.

Creditors of Thomas Cook’s airline and tour operator companies will need to complete aProof of Debt formand submit to AlixPartners. Further information can be found on AlixPartners’dedicated website.

Creditors of Thomas Cook’s retail and aircraft maintenance companies will need to complete aProof of Debt formand submit to Interpath Advisory. Further information be found on thededicated website.

Once you have registered and the Special Manager receives yourProof of Debt formthey will add you to the list of creditors and include you on future correspondence about the case.

Thomas Cook was managing a large number of personal injury claims from former customers. Generally, these claims are not covered by insurance, and they will be treated as unsecured creditors in the liquidation. It is very unlikely that sufficient funds will be realised from the sale of assets to make payments against these claims.

The government has announcedthat it intends to develop a statutory compensation scheme to provide for those customers facing the most serious hardship as a result of injuries or loss of life. Further details of the scheme, including eligibility, will be announced when Parliament returns after the general election.

Dr Peter Highnam will no longer be taking up the role of CEO of ARIA due to personal reasons. We will announce further details of ARIA’s leadership in due course.

The Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has today (1 February 2022) appointed Dr Peter Highnam as Chief Executive of the UK’s new Advanced Research and Invention Agency (ARIA), to lead the formation of the agency and direct its initial funding of high-risk programmes.

ARIAforms a critical part of the UK government’s science and research agenda. Backed by £800 million, it will empower exceptional scientists to focus on high-risk projects at the frontier of discovery and innovation that could transform people’s lives for the better, maintaining the UK’s position on the international stage as a science superpower.

Born in the UK, Dr Peter Highnam brings a wealth of experience making him uniquely capable to step into the role, as he joinsARIAfrom the USA’s research agencyDARPAwhere he has served as Deputy Director since February 2018. He will take up his post asARIA’s firstCEOon 3 May 2022, for a fixed term of 5 years.

ARIAis based on models that have proved successful in other countries, in particular the influential US Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) model. This was instrumental in creating transformational technologies such as the internet andGPS, changing the way people live and work, while increasing productivity and economic growth.

More recently,ARPA’s successor,DARPA, was a vital pre-pandemic funder ofmRNAvaccines and antibody therapies, leading to criticalCOVID-19 therapies.

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said:

Dr Peter Highnam’s appointment is a major triumph for the UK. His expert direction will lead the agency’s formation, ensuring the funding of high-risk programmes that will continue to push the boundaries of science and technology.

Under Dr Highnam’s leadership,ARIAwill ensure the benefits of research and development will be felt in our society and economy over the course of generations, and that the technologies, discoveries, products, and ideas the agency invests in are supported to create the industries of tomorrow.

The government has committed to increase public investment inR&Dto £20 billion in 2024-2025, andARIAwill be an integral and invaluable addition to the UK’s flourishingR&Decosystem.

Operating with flexibility and speed, avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy, and experimenting with different funding models,ARIAwill ensure the UK remains on the front line of experimental research.

Science Minister George Freeman said:

The UK’s scientific community has a proud history of discovery, and the imagination and creativity of our discovery scientists and innovators – from Isaac Newton to Ada Lovelace, Frank Whittle, Alan Turing and Dame Sarah Gilbert’s team developing theCOVID-19 vaccine – continue to transform our world.

Dr Peter Highnam’s appointment asARIA’s firstCEOwill enable our ground-breaking new agency to push the boundaries of high-risk science in the 21st century. His impressive wealth of experience puts him in a unique position to lead the direction of funding for the most ground-breaking projects in the UK and maintain our status as a leading innovation nation.

UK Research and Innovation Chief Executive Professor Dame Ottoline Leyser said:

Dr Peter Highnam‘s breadth of experience in leading the development and translation of transformational ideas will be a huge asset toARIAand to the UK’s research and innovation system.

ARIAhas a unique role to play in the ecosystem, enhancing the UK’s ability to experiment with novel approaches to finding and supporting people and ideas at the frontiers of discovery and innovation.

On behalf ofUKRII’d like to welcome Dr Highnam to his new role. I am looking forward to working alongside him to unleash the full potential of researchers and innovators across the UK to change people’s lives for the better.

With the appointment Dr Highnam as chief executive, the search forARIA’s first Chair has also recommenced today.

This is an unprecedented opportunity to help to design and buildARIAfrom the ground up, as the Chair will support Dr Peter Highnam to deliverARIA’s goals and ground-breaking ambitions. The Chair will also be a key counsel to theCEO, and ensure the agency’s effective governance.

All applications will be reviewed by an Advisory Assessment Panel comprised of the Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance;BEIS’ Director General for Science, Innovation and Growth, Jo Shanmugalingam;CEOand co-founder of DeepMind, Demis Hassabis CBE, former Chairman of the Vaccine Taskforce, and Managing Partner at SV Health Investors, Kate Bingham DBE.

This appointment will be a fair and open process, overseen by the Executive Search agency Saxton Bampflyde.More information about the role ofARIAChair is available on the Saxton Bampflyde site.

Dr Peter Highnam joinedDARPAin February 2018 as Deputy Director and served as acting Director on 2 occasions.

The Chancellor has today (Tuesday 17 March) confirmed the Government will continue to pay funding to local authorities for the free entitlements for two, three and four-year-olds, providing reassurance for early years settings in light of coronavirus.

The Department for Education has set out its expectation that local authorities should follow its position and continue to pass on the government funding it receives for these entitlements to providers, in the event that any are advised to close by Public Health England or children are not able to attend due to coronavirus, to minimise short-term disruption.

To provide maximum clarity and stability to the early years sector during this time of rapidly changing circumstances, the government has also confirmed today that there will be no rise in the fees paid by early years and childcare providers to register with Ofsted in 2020-21. This follows a recent consultation with the sector, which took on responses on fees for the Early Years Register.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said:

Millions of parents rely on childcare and the vital service provided by nurseries, childminders and preschools. Making sure that young children can be cared for safely so that their parents are able to work where required is of the utmost importance now more than ever.

In recognition of this, we will continue to pay for all free early years entitlements places, even in the event that settings are closed on the advice of Public Health England, or children are not able to attend due to coronavirus, and we will not be asking for funding back from local authorities.

The advice from Public Health England continues to be that all educational settings, including nurseries, preschools and childminders, should remain open unless advised otherwise. The Department for Education is providing daily updates to local authorities and early years sector organisations.

Children and Families Minister Vicky Ford said:

I want to thank all the early years practitioners who day-in and day-out do such an excellent job. I know these must be difficult times and I hope these announcements show that we are listening to their concerns and taking urgent action. I particularly want to thank the Early Years Alliance, the National Day Nurseries Association, and the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years for their engagement at this critical time.

The Department for Education alsoconfirmedtoday that Ofsted is to temporarily suspend routine inspections of schools, colleges, early years settings, children’s social care providers and local authorities to reduce the burden on staff who are providing vital services to the nation in response to coronavirus.",Financial Boost to Voluntary Organisations,Welfare,,id25_911

From today, the government will be able to scrutinise and intervene in certain acquisitions made by anyone, including businesses and investors, that could harm the UK’s national security, better reflecting the threats we face today.

The government will also be able to impose certain conditions on an acquisition or, if necessary, unwind or block it – although it is expected this will happen rarely and the vast majority of deals will require no intervention and be able to proceed without delay.

TheNSIAct will give investors additional certainty and clarity and cement the UK’s world-leading reputation as a global champion of free trade and investment as well as an attractive place to invest, with more transparency and more simple, efficient clearance processes for relevant acquisitions.

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said:

The UK is world-renowned as an attractive place to invest but we have always been clear that we will not hesitate to step in where necessary to protect our national security.

The new investment screening process in place from today is simple and quick, giving investors and firms the certainty they need to do business, and giving everyone in the UK the peace of mind that their security remains our number one priority.

The vast majority of acquisitions will require no intervention and will be able to proceed quickly and with certainty in the knowledge that the government will not revisit a transaction once cleared unless false or misleading information was provided.

The UK business delegation includes representation from UK semiconductor companies specialising in photonics, quantum, memory, design and manufacturing equipment, and is even bigger than last year.

By harnessing the complementary strengths of the UK and Taiwan, the delegation is keen to explore opportunities to build connections with the Taiwanese semiconductor sector and drive economic growth in both markets. The UK’s strong semiconductor R&D base and commercial strengths complement Taiwan’s status as a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing. This visit is building on the UK’s already extensive collaboration with Taiwan, including the second year of a joint R&D programme with mutual funding of £10 million.

With Taiwan being a hub for semiconductor manufacturing, SEMICON Taiwan is a fantastic opportunity for both Taiwanese and UK companies to connect and explore possibilities for trade and collaboration. Building upon the success of the UK Pavilion at SEMICON Taiwan last year, 15 out of the 24 high-growth innovative companies are new to the market this year, indicating the great potential for trade and collaboration between the UK and Taiwan.

The UK is a leader in compound semiconductors, R&D, manufacturing equipment, design and photonics. Compound semiconductors are vital in growth markets such as autonomous vehicles and future telecoms; they also enable innovation in green energy and are essential in achieving net zero targets.

Come visit the UK Pavilion to learn about the UK’s capabilities, discuss trade and investment opportunities, as well as scope for collaboration on R&D!

Voluntary organisations from across the country – such as local Mind organisations, Ambitious about Autism, Support After Rape and Sexual Violence, LGBT Foundation and Campaign Against Living Miserably – will receive a financial boost to expand their existing support services.

This fund is administered by Mind as part of the Mental Health Consortia, made up of Mind, the Association of Mental Health Providers, Centre for Mental Health, Mental Health Foundation, the National Survivor User Network and Rethink Mental Illness.

Mental Health Minister Nadine Dorries said:

“This epidemic has had huge consequences for us all, but for some it has been especially difficult, leading to loneliness, anxiety and other mental health challenges.

“I believe we must pull together as a nation during these trying times and I am absolutely determined that no one should have to cope with mental illness alone.

“While our NHS remains open for business and has adapted its care to continue to provide vital mental health care throughout the crisis, this investment will only strengthen what’s on offer and ensure emotional support sits at the heart of the community.”

The local charities benefiting include a wide range of support services including:

This marks the first round of funding to be allocated to the sector, with a second wave of projects to receive funding shortly.

This funding package follows the£4.2 million investmentannounced by the Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock for mental health charities – such as Samaritans, YoungMinds and Bipolar UK – during Mental Health Awareness Week, so they can continue to support people experiencing mental health challenges.

Chief Executive of Mind Paul Farmer said:

“It’s important that Mind, working closely with our colleagues in the Mental Health Consortia, have been able to quickly promote, assess and award much-needed funds to charities providing frontline mental health support in the midst of the coronavirus crisis. We were inundated with applications for the fund, showing just how much the support is needed.

“The coronavirus pandemic is impacting all of us, but is especially hard on those of us living with a mental health problem. The recipients of this much-needed fund are doing incredible work to support those who need them most, both on a national scale and in the community, and the money granted will help them continue to work in innovative ways.

“There’s still far more to be done, and we look forward to continuing to work together to help combat the mental health emergency we find ourselves in as we fund more organisations across England.”

916,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-introduces-legislation-to-relieve-burden-on-businesses-and-support-economic-recovery,News story,Government introduces legislation to relieve burden on businesses and support economic recovery,The government has introduced the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Bill in Parliament.,"Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy",20 May 2020,"The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Bill received royal assent on 25 June and is now an Act.

The government today (Wednesday 20 May) introduced the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Bill in Parliament, which will put in place a series of measures to amend insolvency and company law to support business to address the challenges resulting from the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19).

The Bill consists of 6 insolvency measures and 2 corporate governance measures.

The insolvency measures will provide vital support to businesses to help them through this period of instability.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma said:

This is a particularly challenging time for businesses right across the UK, and we are doing all we can to support them through this period.

Our proposals have been widely welcomed by business groups. The Bill will help companies that were trading successfully before theCOVID-19emergency to protect jobs and put them in the best possible position to bounce back.

The corporate governance measures will introduce temporary easements and flexibility to businesses where they are coping with reduced resources and restrictions.

This Bill will do this through:

Jonathan Geldart, Director General of theIoDsaid:

Directors have significant legal obligations, and this Bill provides some reassurance that those who act responsibly won’t be caught out by the insolvency system. It’s crucial that directors are able to sustain their organisations and the people who rely on them during these difficult times.

FSBNational Chair Mike Cherry said:

The incoming Corporate Insolvency and Governance Bill will be an important step to helping many small firms during this crisis.

The measures will immediately go some way to mitigate some of the problems small businesses are facing, such as the relaxation of wrongful trading rules which will allow directors of struggling companies to continue trading without fear of legal repercussions. The company moratorium, filing extensions and voiding of statutory demands are particularly important for smaller businesses, it is important that these provisions continue for as long as is necessary.

This Bill’s 3 main purposes are:

The measures in the Bill will support businesses, and where applicable charities and mutual societies, through the coronavirus emergency by:

Other measures in place to support business and workers during the coronavirus emergency:

The first measure designed to support companies in this crisis is the introduction of a company moratorium. This will provide struggling businesses a formal breathing space to pursue a rescue plan during which time no legal action can be taken against a company without leave of the court.

This measure will give businesses a 20-business day opportunity to consider a rescue plan, extendable to 40 business days, with further extensions at the agreement of creditors or the court. The company will remain under the control of its directors during the moratorium, but the process will be overseen by a monitor who must be a licensed insolvency practitioner.

The Bill also introduces a permanent change to the use of termination clauses in supply contracts. As a result of the measure, where a company has entered an insolvency or restructuring procedure or obtains a moratorium during this period of crisis, the company’s suppliers will not be able to rely on contractual terms to stop supplying, or vary the contract terms with the company, for example increasing the price of supplies. The customer is required to pay for any supplies made once it is in the insolvency process but is not required to pay outstanding amounts due for past supplies while it is arranging its rescue plan.

Suppliers and other creditors will benefit if more companies are able to survive and repay more of their debts by implementing a rescue plan. The measure also contains safeguards to ensure that suppliers can be relieved of the requirement to supply if it causes hardship to their business. There will also be a temporary exemption for small company suppliers during the emergency.

The Bill also introduces a new restructuring plan as an option for companies in financial difficulty. The measure will allow struggling companies, or their creditors or members, to propose a new restructuring plan which will provide an alternative rescue option for companies that are suffering financially. The plan will enable complex debt arrangements to be restructured and will support the injection of new rescue finance.

It will introduce a cross-class cramdown that will allow dissenting classes of creditors to be  bound by the plan, if sanctioned by the court as fair and equitable, and if the court is satisfied that those creditors would be no worse off than if the company entered an alternative insolvency procedure.

This new plan will support more companies to be rescued, rather than going through a value destructive liquidation process, giving a better return for creditors, preserving jobs and maintaining productivity.

This Bill introduces temporary provisions to void statutory demands made between 1 March 2020 and 30 June. The Bill will also restrict winding up petitions from 27 April 2020 to 30 June 2020. These temporary measures are intended to prevent aggressive creditor action against otherwise viable companies struggling because of coronavirus.

The Bill will temporarily remove the threat of personal liability for wrongful trading from company directors while they make their best efforts to continue to trade.

This will be for any period of trading between 1 March to 30 June. As we have already announced, directors can be assured that they can use their best endeavours to trade through during the coronavirus period without the threat of personal liability for wrongful trading should the company ultimately become insolvent.

All the other checks and duties on directors remain in place.

Certain financial services firms and contracts have been excluded from some of the reforms. The financial services regulators have existing powers to intervene in the business of financial services firms in distress, and the UK has a number of existing special insolvency regimes for certain of these firms. Those regimes reflect the complexity of dealing with these firms where they are at risk of failing. In addition, the way that goods and services are traded in the financial sector is often different to the rest of the economy.

The Bill’s exclusions for financial services will ensure that these existing special insolvency regimes are unaffected, and that financial market participants have the legal certainty needed to facilitate the efficient functioning of financial markets.

The company moratorium will not be available to certain financial services firms, and will not affect certain financial contracts. The new termination clauses measures will also not apply to financial contracts or to financial services firms. This is to ensure legal certainty and support the efficient functioning of financial markets. The suspension of wrongful trading will also not apply to certain financial services firms.

Financial services firms will however have access to the new restructuring plan, though with appropriate safeguards including a role for the financial services regulators.

There are no exclusions for financial services firms for the other measures provided in the Bill.

The Bill temporarily allows those companies that are under a legal duty to hold anAGMorGMto hold a meeting by other means even if their constitution would not normally allow it. As a result, directors will not be exposed to liability for measures that need shareholder endorsement, and shareholders rights are preserved.

The measures relating to company meetings are intended to be retrospective from 26 March so that any company that has already had to hold anAGMin a way that adhered to social distancing measures, but that, as a result, did not meet relevant obligations in their constitution, will have done so in accordance with the law. Companies who were forced to postponeAGMswhich were due to be held after 26 March will be given a limited period after the Bill is passed to hold thoseAGMsusing the new flexibilities

The measures will not prevent shareholders from exercising their right to vote on resolutions or other matters brought before the meeting, though they may be prevented from voting in person (rather than by post or by electronic means)

The Bill enables the Secretary of State to make regulations to extend deadlines for 3 types of filing:

Currently failure to file certain information with Companies House by the relevant deadline can result in the company paying a late filing penalty or the directors being prosecuted. Even though Companies House is taking a proportionate approach to compliance, a failure to meet statutory deadlines can have broader impacts on a company’s record or credit rating.

This measure will reduce pressure on companies that are currently unable to meet their filing  deadlines allowing them to focus their resources on keeping their businesses going in this uncertain time but ensuring that the data is filed with Companies House within a reasonable time.

Jennifer Marshall, Chair of theCLLSSub-Committee and former President of the Insolvency Lawyers Association said:

TheCLLSand theILAsupport the addition of new tools to the restructuring toolbox; the moratorium, in particular, should help businesses struggling due to COVID and the ability to cram down a class is a useful addition to the scheme of arrangement. These are the most significant reforms of UK insolvency law for a decade and we will be digesting the detail with interest.",Research report,Informational,,id25_916

The latest statistics for Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) applications show that three-quarters of applicants are being found fit for work or are stopping their claim before their assessment period has been completed.

Minister for Employment, Chris Grayling said:

The vast majority of people who are applying for these benefits are being found fit for work or have stopped their claim. These are people who under the old system would have been abandoned on incapacity benefits. It’s a clear indication of why reform is so urgently needed.

This is exactly why we are going to reassess everyone claiming incapacity benefits for their ability to work, from this October. They will now be given the support they need to get back to work and will be expected to look for work if they are able to do so.

For new ESA claims from October 2008 to November 2009, the breakdown is:

People making a claim for Employment and Support Allowance undergo a Work Capability Assessment (WCA). To ensure that the assessment is fair and accurate we announced last month that an independent review would be undertaken by Professor Malcolm Harrington.

Unemployment is down and employment is up, which is good news. The private sector is leading the way and creating jobs and opportunities for people across the country. Today’s figures show that businesses are responding well and we will continue to help them expand and develop, as the economy grows.

Nonetheless, we have more to do to help those on benefits continue to move into work as well. That’s why we are introducing the Universal Credit to ensure that work will always pay more than a life on benefits and alongside it the Work Programme, which will give people the tailored support they need to move into work and stay there. We have to get our labour force ready for the recovery and our benefit claimants ready for the workplace.

Last week Ministers launched The White Paper,Universal Credit: welfare that workswhich will remove the complexities of the current benefit system. The Universal Credit will also reduce the scope for fraud and error significantly as it makes the whole system simpler and easier to understand.

A shocking £5.2 billion of taxpayers’ money is lost through fraud and error in benefits and tax credits each year. Given the pressure on the public purse, every penny counts and the Government will clamp down across the whole spectrum of fraud and error - from benefit fraud to systematic organised crime. Identifying errors and putting them right is fundamental to reducing costs.

The Fraud and Error Strategy, commissioned by the Prime Minister, is published today and sets out a wide range of options including setting up a new investigation service to catch benefit and tax credit cheats and the use of shared data to track the muddy footprints of professional fraudsters - and gives a strong signal that criminal gangs will no longer find the UK an easy target.

People who are repeatedly caught defrauding the system and organised criminal gangs can expect lengthy bans.

Minister for Welfare Reform Lord Freud said:

Fraud and error is costing the Government and the taxpayer £5 billion a year - this is unfair and unacceptable.

We are reforming the system and stepping up our efforts to catch the benefit and tax cheats who are stealing money which is meant for the most vulnerable people in our society.

We will use credit reference agencies and data matching techniques to spot the tell-tale patterns of fraud. We will employ 200 more investigators and bring in a mobile taskforce to investigate each and every claim in high fraud areas. When people are convicted we will get back the money we are owed, introduce tough punishments and strip the assets of criminal gangs - my message to them is that benefit fraud is a crime that just doesn’t pay.

Although benefit claimants will find it harder to commit fraud under the new Universal Credit, which is a simpler system designed to reduce the scope for fraud and error, Ministers warn that no one will be let off under the new measures and that minor offenders will be issued with instant civil penalties of £50 or more.

The Exchequer Secretary, David Gauke, said:

There has been too much error and too much fraud for too long in our benefits and tax credits systems. Today we are shining a light on the problem across the system and setting out a radical, cross-Government solution. We simply have to make every penny count - and that includes going after the cheats at every level. One of the ways we will do this is by modernising the Pay as You Earn tax system to link it to the benefits system for the first time.

The strategy, alongside the proposals new welfare reforms, will ensure fraud and error is detected quickly and that the Government gets back money owed.

The key measures in the Fraud and Error Strategy published today are:

The review into employment services for disabled people by RADAR Chief Executive Liz Sayce, recommends changes to Government policy to support disabled people to work in any role in any sector - rather than in segregated employment.

The Sayce review recommends doubling the numbers of people able to use Access to Work - which gives financial help for support workers, interpreters, equipment and other practical support to enable disabled people to keep and get jobs.

It recommends raising the overall numbers securing specialist disability support to 100,000 within existing resources, with further expansion longer-term.

RADAR Chief Executive Liz Sayce said:

The work aspirations of disabled people have changed.  Again and again disabled people - especially young disabled people - said they wanted the same choice of jobs as everyone else - in every sector from hairdressing to engineering, from apprenticeships to work experience, from self employment to co-ops and employee to director.

That is why I am recommending empowering disabled people and employers by opening up Access to Work, widening access to information and peer support and ensuring support can go with the individual, from job to job, equipping disabled people for the economy of today and tomorrow.  Young people do not expect a job for life - so we need to design support that can go with the individual, from job to job.

There was also a total consensus among disabled people’s organisations and charities that segregated employment is not a model for the 21st century.  Instead in-work support like Access to Work is the right way to support disabled people so that those acquiring disability can keep their jobs; and those entering work can work in any sector they choose.

We have good evidence and examples of ‘what works’ for people facing the greatest barriers: work experience in regular workplaces and flexible support for both employee and employer. Putting this in place will support disabled people’s independence and sense of identity and help close the employment gap between disabled and non-disabled people. This would boost the economy by £13bn.

Minister for Disabled People, Maria Miller who commissioned the report, said:

This review is about spending money differently, not cutting it.  The amount of money going into employment services for disabled people is already being protected.

I should like to thank Liz for the report, which sets out a bold and innovative vision for moving support away from institutions and placing power in the hands of disabled people themselves.

Disabled people are part of mainstream society and that means being part of the mainstream workplace.  It is vital that Government Departments work together to realise the aspirations of disabled people and to support them to achieve those aspirations.

That is why I am announcing here and now that the Government has accepted the recommendation that a cross Government ministerial group should drive forward a strategy for disabled people’s employment.

The report makes a number of other detailed recommendations on how we might better use the resource available to Government in supporting disabled people into and in work.  We will be considering all the recommendations and will respond in due course.  Government intends to consult on these before moving to any decisions.

The review was set up to look at employment support available for disabled people and shows:

The report “Getting in, staying in and getting on: Disability employment support fit for the future” is published at:http://www.dwp.gov.uk/policy/welfare-reform/specialist-disability-employment/

Paul Farmer, Chief Executive at the mental health charity Mind, said:

We welcome this review and in particular the recommendation to make Access to Work more widely available. People with mental health problems are often excluded from traditional disability support systems, despite having one of the highest want to work rates of any disability group. Currently, only one per cent of the budget is spent on people with mental health problems, denying many people access to a valuable resource which could support them on their journey to gain and retain employment.

Dr Rachel Perkins, Chair of Equality 2025, said:

The system that has grown up historically is not equitable. It does little for people most likely to be out of work - people with mental health conditions, learning disabilities or autistic spectrum disorders - and it serves far more men than women. We need a system that supports individuals to get any job we choose: after all who wants to pack boxes just because you are disabled?

Mark Goldring CBE, Chief Executive Mencap, said:

We can do much more to help people with disabilities into work in a way that directly benefits them and the wider society. Less than 10% of people with a learning disability are currently employed but we know that most want to. With modest help it is possible for many more people to work in open employment alongside their non disabled colleagues. This is the way that policy and practice should take us.

Mike Adams, Chief Executive Essex Coalition of Disabled People, said:

Putting support in the hands of disabled individuals will empower far more people to get on at work and to participate fully in society than happens now. And there is nothing more powerful than learning from what other disabled people have found most useful.

With just over six months to go before the largest employers begin enrolling eligible workers into pension savings, the response sets out that automatic enrolment rates for the next tax year will be aligned with tax and National Insurance thresholds. This will make it easier for firms who will not have to negotiate another layer of complexity.

Minister for Pensions Steve Webb said:

The overwhelming response to our consultation was the call to align the automatic enrolment trigger with existing payroll thresholds. This will help firms make a success of these reforms, as they will be able to better understand who is eligible to be enrolled.

These changes strike the right balance between getting as many people into workplace pension saving as possible and ensuring that we do not enrol some people who would not financially benefit from saving. People who are excluded from automatic enrolment will still be able to opt themselves in, benefiting from a contribution from their employer.

The new, single tier State Pension announced in the Budget will dramatically improve savings incentives for people on a low income.

The Government must review the rates each tax year.

The pilot was designed to be evaluated using a random assignment approach. However, difficulties in the implementation of the pilot meant that robust overall estimates were not possible. A stronger basis for impact estimates existed for those individuals identified through basic skills screening as having a potential skills need - no impact was detected on training, sanctions or early labour market outcomes for this group.

The research found that those claimants who were mandated were generally in favour of training, but said it did not always meet their needs or was not of the quality they would have liked. Although they were mandated to training, many said they would have attended in any case, because they welcomed the activity and the help and because they felt a general obligation to follow theirJCPadviser’s recommendations.

Findings:

Although some claimants and advisers felt that mandation to training was sometimes reasonable and had its role in dealing with a minority of ‘work-shy’ claimants, it was also argued that the policy treats all claimants indiscriminately as ‘work-shy’. The report also notes that some long-term unemployed require individual help to overcome barriers, such as having a criminal record or health problems, rather than training.

Few claimants in the research had their benefits stopped for non-compliance, and a number were sanctioned for lateness or forgetting to attend rather than for rejecting the training offered. The report concludes that sanctions can cause hardship to families and is in many cases unlikely to be effective in encouraging future compliance.

TheDWPWorking Paper/Report 768 ‘TheJSASkills Conditionality Pilot is published on 19th August 2011.Read the full report

The Job Seeker’s Allowance (JSA) Skills Conditionality Pilot was launched on April 2010 with the aim of exploring the effects of mandating participation in training. The pilot targetedJSAclaimants entering stage 3 of the Jobseeker’s Regime and Flexible New Deal (JRFND) - generally unemployed for 6 months - with an identified skills need. The pilot was designed to randomly assign claimants to a test group, where they were mandated to training, and to a control group, where training would be voluntary. Assignment was on the basis of National Insurance Number.

The report presents the findings from two parallel studies of the pilot. The quantitative analysis used administrative data to assess the implementation of the pilot and whether it could be used to provide valid estimates of the impact of mandation. The qualitative analysis explored the experiences, views and behaviour of participants in the pilots: principally mandated claimants and Jobcentre Plus (JCP) advisers, but also training providers.

The research was carried out on behalf of theDWPby Richard Dorsett (quantitative analysis), Heather Rolfe and Anitha George (qualitative research) at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.

The Association of British Credit Unions (ABCUL) is the successful bidder to deliver the DWP’s Credit Union Expansion Project to help meet the growing demand for modern banking products for people on low incomes.

A recent feasibility study showed that modernising the industry and helping it become financially self-sustainable would enable credit unions to help up to 1 million more people, giving them access to banking products, debt advice and affordable loans.

Currently around 7 million people fall into the trap of high-cost credit, with some being charged more than 6000% in interest on short-term loans. The expansion project will save consumers up to £1 billion in loan interest repayments by March 2019.

Minister for Welfare Reform David Freud said:

Credit unions offer an alternative to vulnerable people who have few safe options to get cash when they need it most. They are the antidote to predatory loan sharks or high-interest lenders.

We are pleased ABCUL will be carrying out our investment to modernise and make credit unions financially self sufficient so they continue to help those in their communities who need it the most.

ABCUL aim for credit unions to have up to 1 million more members by 2019.

ABCUL Chief Executive Mark Lyonette said:

We are delighted to have been selected to run this ambitious and timely project.  I look forward to working with the DWP to ensure that credit unions can expand their collaborative work and create the levels of service which will attract many more people to use their products.

More credit unions will offer a wider range of products including current accounts, Cash ISAs and innovative budgeting accounts.  The centralisation and streamlining of day to day tasks and the introduction of innovative modern access channels will make credit unions a much more attractive proposition to many more people and secure a solid future for the sector.

In June 2012 it was announced that the government would take forward the findings of a DWP Credit Union Expansion feasibility study and DWP would invest in £38m in credit unions to March 2015.

The investment is conditional upon the credit union industry meeting agreed milestones for collaboration, modernisation and expansion, and to deliver this expansion in a way that makes them financially sustainable.

ABCUL will be supported by credit unions with a membership of around 470,000 to carry out the Credit Union Expansion Project.

Chah-e Anjir is a centuries-old settlement lying on a wadi which predates the 1950s irrigation and development projects that created the habitable area of Nad ‘Ali.

The significance of Chah-e Anjir is valued by the local Pashtuns who, with their long memories, have a deep understanding of the historical role the town has played.

Of late, the area has been somewhat disenfranchised, falling into the gaps between the Nad ‘Ali district centre, the seat of local governance to its south, and Lashkar Gah, with which it shares a history of geographical significance.

The newly-appointed Afghan National Police (ANP) Chief for Nad ‘Ali, Major Shadi Khan, is aiming to bring about a renewed focus on this northern part of his district.

Together with the local ANP commander in Chah-e Anjir, Lieutenant Hamidullah, Major Khan is hoping to strengthen the position of the ANP in northern Nad ‘Ali.

Captain Ross Boyd from The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland (5 SCOTS), who mentors Lieutenant Hamidullah in his day-to-day security operations, said:

This new police station provides a model for what policing in Helmand should look like. It gives the locals of Chah-e Anjir a focus for local security issues and portrays the ANP as a professional and credible force.

The ANP themselves can take pride in it and identify it as a beacon for their own professionalism and development and as a representation of the Afghan Government in the area.

A reinvigorated recruiting strategy is focusing on getting local Nad ‘Ali recruits through the intensive eight-week training course at the Helmand Police Training Centre, currently being run by troops from 5 SCOTS.

There is also a plan to redeploy police from the now largely secure Lashkar Gah to the more contested outlying districts. These are seen by ISAF commanders as the vital first steps in building a strong local police presence in Chah-e Anjir and surrounding areas.

Lashkar Gah currently provides the model of security force laydown in the Helmand counter-insurgency campaign. The ANP provide community policing in the city centre, in the most part without ISAF assistance, and Afghan National Army troops and their ISAF partners provide security in the more contested areas outside the urban sprawl.

The challenge now is to recreate this example in the districts around Lashkar Gah.

This is the latest measure to be announced following the Government’s commitment, given last year, to upholding the Armed Forces Covenant, and the measure is consistent with the principles of the Covenant.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said:

I am delighted that, in addition to tax-free payments from the MOD’s Armed Forces Compensation Scheme, seriously injured serving personnel and veterans will also be able to avoid the unnecessary duplication of reassessments and receive disability benefits via these new arrangements.

These brave individuals have served their country with honour and it is only right and proper that they receive financial support to help them with injuries caused by their service.

Recognising the considerable sacrifice made by a number of courageous members of the Armed Forces who have been injured as a result of their service, the Government has decided to put in place special arrangements for these personnel to help them cover the ongoing costs of their injuries.

Rather than face separate assessments these individuals will automatically be entitled to payments to help with the additional costs associated with their injuries. Eligibility for these payments will be linked to their Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) awards and the payments will provide financial reassurance for the future.

Those currently in receipt of an AFCS award for serious injury and Disability Living Allowance will also benefit from the arrangements.

We teach how to search for explosives, ground sign awareness and the safe handling of explosives for when they are dealing with devices.

It’ll be down to them when they qualify, and if they carry out their drills and procedures the way they’ve been taught they’ll be saving not only their own lives but also the lives of others.

While Cpl Sivo is teaching from his own experiences, his Afghan colleague draws on his own varied experiences to great effect as well:

It’s important to have the experience of an Afghan instructor because he’s done the job many times before, and when he comes into a lesson he’ll relate it to real-time experiences he’s gone through.

Having worked with the Afghans over a period of months since his tour began, Cpl Sivo has seen the capability of the Afghans to deal with explosive devices steadily improve, which is very rewarding for the young instructor:

With the Explosive Hazard Reduction Team members that have already been trained, we’ve seen the improvements from previous operations that have been carried out,” he said. “They’re able to deliver the capability safely and very professionally.

We’re getting the Afghans to lead the way with more soldiers who are capable of dealing with these tasks. The most rewarding thing is knowing that, once they qualify as Explosive Hazard Reduction Team searchers or operators, they will be out there leading the way in providing peace and stability to their own country.

935,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hms-chatham-rescues-seamen-from-storm,News story,HMS Chatham rescues seamen from storm,NATO flagship HMS Chatham made a dramatic rescue of 23 seamen from a merchant vessel off the coast of Somalia on Friday 21 May 2010.,Ministry of Defence,25 May 2010,"The Royal Navy warship had been patrolling the sea area approximately 80 miles (130km) west of Socotra as part of NATO’s counter-piracy Operation OCEAN SHIELD when the drama began early in the morning of Thursday 20 May.

HMS Chatham’s bridge team received a distress call from the Master of MV Dubai Moon, who said that his ship was caught in a tropical storm 90 miles (145km) south west of Socotra and struggling to make headway in extremely rough seas and high winds.

The warship immediately made best speed towards the stricken vessel.

As HMS Chatham made her way into the storm, the weather worsened into a tropical cyclone and the situation onboard MV Dubai Moon became even more perilous.

Listing heavily, with her cargo of vehicles crashing around the deck, she drifted ever closer to a small island off the coast. It was only due to the tireless efforts of the Master that she avoided running aground.

The Master and HMS Chatham’s Commanding Officer, Commander Simon Huntington, spoke throughout the night trying to determine the best way to save the vessel.

At daybreak on Friday 21 May Dubai Moon dropped her anchors in an attempt to hold her position as by now she was getting ever closer to another, larger island, Jazirat Samhah.

Whilst her anchors did not take permanent hold, they prevented her from running aground onto a reef, which she cleared by less than 1,000 yards (900m) before being pushed offshore by the wind.

As the day wore on the weather improved slightly, presenting HMS Chatham with an opportunity to rescue the crew.

In very challenging conditions, the warship launched her Lynx helicopter and, in an operation which lasted for over three hours, the 23 seamen were winched by helicopter to safety from the MV Dubai Moon.

The relieved seamen were given hot drinks and blankets when they landed onboard HMS Chatham.

Commander Huntington said:

This rescue was conducted in the most challenging sea conditions imaginable and I am extremely proud of my ship’s company whose sole focus was to assist the Master and crew of MV Dubai Moon.

It was, without doubt, the professionalism and courage of my sailors and aircrew that ensured this rescue was a success.

The tropical cyclone tested the ship and everyone on board; it is the quality of our people, equipment and training which has resulted in the Royal Navy saving the lives of fellow mariners in such demanding circumstances.

After the rescue, Hassan Madar, the Ethiopian Master of the MV Dubai Moon, said:

Normally we operate close to the coast, but we had to go far out to sea to avoid pirates.

That meant we could not find shelter from the storm. If we had not been rescued by the Royal Navy and NATO we would have died with my ship. They were the only people to respond to our distress call; we owe them our lives.

HMS Chatham is leading the NATO Task Force posted to the area to counter piracy.

As part of this operation, on Friday 14 May, in a co-ordinated search with an EU Naval Force maritime patrol aircraft, HMS Chatham’s Lynx helicopter spotted a suspected pirate vessel towing two attack boats approximately 150 miles (240km) off the coast of Tanzania.

After monitoring the vessel through the night, at dawn, in a well planned operation, the pirates were forced to surrender by the overwhelming force posed by HMS Chatham, her Lynx helicopter and fast boats containing the ship’s Royal Marines detachment.

The Royal Marines team boarded the larger craft and found ten Somalis and a large amount of fuel on board; the suspected pirates had been observed throwing items, including their weapons and other piracy-related equipment, into the sea.

The two smaller attack boats were separated from the larger craft by the Royal Marines team and the warship and her Lynx helicopter used their combined firepower to destroy the smaller craft, ensuring that the suspected pirates could not continue with their mission.

Disarmed and without the means to commit an act of piracy, the ten Somalis were left with only enough fuel in the larger vessel to return to Somalia.",Sustainability considerations integrated into the acquisition process and day-to-day activities and behaviours.,Other,Informational,id25_935

Yesterday’s meeting is the third meeting of the Task Force but the first to be jointly chaired by UK Minister for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans, Andrew Robathan, and, in his first official visit to the Ministry of Defence, the US Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Dr Clifford Stanley.

Mr Robathan said:

As our servicemen and women have stood together historically, and in recent operations, so the US and UK will stand together in recognising the sacrifices made by them and their families.

Our nations share the belief that there is much benefit to be gained through continued close engagement, and through the Service Personnel, Families and Veterans Task Force we will seek to learn from shared information and best practice.

Both nations ask a great deal from our Armed Forces and believe they have a right to expect a commitment from us to support them through the challenges of Service life. In the UK that commitment is embraced within the Armed Forces Covenant, the principles of which we are writing into law for the first time.

The latest 25 will be in addition to this at a cost of £30m.

Foxhound, the Army’s state-of-the-art light protected patrol vehicle, arrived in Helmand province in June of this year.

The Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology, Peter Luff, made the procurement announcement today at an event at the Army’s Bulford Camp showcasing the capabilities of Service personnel from 4th Mechanized Brigade who are preparing to deploy on Operation HERRICK 17.

Mr Luff said:

I was very pleased to be able to confirm the purchase of 25 additional new Foxhound vehicles.

Foxhound’s cutting-edge technology gives our troops the ability to engage with Afghan civilians, as they must, whilst benefiting from a high level of protection. Personnel from 4th Mechanized Brigade will be amongst the first to use this outstanding new vehicle.

This is another example of how the MOD, having balanced the budget, is now able to confidently spend money on the equipment that our personnel really need.

Personnel from 4th Mechanized Brigade will be amongst the first to make use of the new Foxhound vehicle on operations. For its size and weight, Foxhound provides unprecedented levels of blast protection against the threats faced by troops on the front line.

Robust enough to withstand the blast from an IED, it has a top speed of 70mph (113km/h). The engine can also be removed and replaced in just 30 minutes and it can drive away from an ambush on only three wheels.

4th Mechanized Brigade will deploy to Afghanistan in October for a six-month tour as the lead formation of Task Force Helmand. Due to the significant progress in the development of the Afghan National Security Forces it will be the first brigade to oversee a drawdown of British troops from Helmand province, with the UK’s military commitment there due to be cut by 500 by the end of the year.

The showcase at Bulford has enabled members of the Task Force to show off their skills, from marksmanship and search dog handling, through to the challenges of having to cook for thousands of soldiers, sailors and airmen and women on a daily basis.

Brigadier Bob Bruce, Commander of 4th Mechanized Brigade, said:

Today has enabled many of the men and women who will deploy on HERRICK 17 to showcase not only the high quality equipment with which they will deploy but also the result of the extensive pre-deployment training that they have conducted.

4th Mechanized Brigade previously deployed to Afghanistan in 2010, but a lot has changed since then. Now we are well down the path of transition - the handover of security responsibilities to our Afghan colleagues - and our strategic outlook is very different to what it was two years ago.

Notably, we will be the first Task Force to see our numbers reduce during the course of our tour, a big challenge but one we will embrace.

We are an experienced and well-balanced Task Force; while based on a regular Army formation we also have a number of regular Royal Navy and RAF Service personnel in our ranks, as well as a number of reservists who have readily volunteered their time to accompany us to the front line.

The tour will see ‘The Black Rats’, as 4th Mechanized Brigade is also known, working in support of the Afghan National Army’s 3/215 Brigade and the Afghan National Police in their mission to bring security and stability to a region that has known years of unrest but has seen steady progress thanks to the efforts of Afghan, British and other international forces.

Approximately 10 per cent of the personnel who deploy on Op HERRICK 17 will be reservists, including elements of 6th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, 103 Battalion Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, 243 (Wessex) Field Hospital and 101st (Northumbrian) Regiment Royal Artillery.

Mr Luff added:

I was delighted to have the opportunity to meet some of the members of 4th Mechanized Brigade who will deploy to Afghanistan in the autumn and will face an entirely new challenge.

They continue the work of their predecessor brigades and also oversee the beginning of our drawdown as Afghanistan looks ahead to a future with its own Armed Forces taking the security lead.

It is of particular importance to the MOD as the UK National Security Strategy 2010 recognises that under some circumstances climate change and resource scarcity increases the likelihood of conflict, instability and state failure.

Climate change is affecting the environments in which our Armed Forces operate whilst resource depletion is increasing competition for critical resources (including fossil fuels) and may result in capabilities becoming unsupportable and/or unaffordable.

To address the military and operational risks posed by climate change and energy security, everyone in MOD and the Defence Sector needs to understand the operational effectiveness challenges and work to provide sustainable through-life operational capabilities.

This includes addressing estate and equipment performance to maximise through-life energy efficiency, reducing our dependence on fossil fuels, exploiting alternative energy technologies, and embracing innovative approaches to the delivery of capability.

This starts at the MOD strategic planning and capability planning stages and continues all the way to disposal of our capabilities.

It also includes our behaviours, equipment use patterns and decision making. Embedding sustainable thinking, design and behaviours through-life will assist in making the MOD more resilient to future economic, social and environmental conditions and achieve maximum operational effect and through-life cost effectiveness.

For instance, if we can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels on operations, we reduce operational and energy security risks due to interdiction of theatre fuel delivery, and through-life capability operating costs.

Analysis indicates that delivering fuel out to the remotest locations in theatre can be between two and ten times the cost of the ‘pump price’; this does not include the human cost we pay to fuel our forces in theatre.

Reducing fossil fuel use also contributes to reducing the MOD’s global carbon footprint, balancing this with operational need.

Sustainability is fundamental to ensuring that defence capabilities are able to operate in a variety of changing environments without reliance on ever more scarce and expensive resources, including energy.

It is important, therefore, that sustainability is addressed during all stages of the acquisition process and in our day-to-day activities and behaviours.",Exercise Pacific Kukri,Other,Informational,id25_938

She finished her tasking off Libya last week and is now on her way back to the UK.

Before she returns home,RFAFort Rosalie will make a brief stop in Civitavecchia, Rome, which will be an opportunity to thank Italy for the support they have given to UK forces during Libya operations and for their own substantial contribution to the international campaign.

RFAFort Rosalie’s Commanding Officer, Captain Phillip T Hanton, said:

RFAFort Rosalie has switched from amphibious exercises in the Mediterranean to supporting maritime strike operations off Libya and will shortly deploy to the North Atlantic for anti-narcotics duties.

This high tempo of front line operations is a vivid demonstration of our integral role in supporting the Royal Navy and our ability to make a direct contribution to UK defence and security.

Libya is the latest in a long line of front line roles for the 23,384-tonne Auxiliary Fleet Support Vessel, which is designed to supply Royal Navy warships with food, stores and ammunition whilst underway.

Twenty-nine years ago, Fort Rosalie provided direct support to the amphibious operations in the Falklands. She later spent much of the 1990s alongside the Croatian port of Split supporting peacekeeping operations in the Balkans.

Successive refits have kept the ship up-to-date, and the demand for her versatile capabilities has never diminished.

RFAFort Rosalie deployed from the UK at the beginning of May 2011 laden with 6,000 cubic metres of stores as part of the Royal Navy’s Response Force Task Group (RFTG) - the UK’s military quick reaction force - for a series of amphibious exercises in the Mediterranean.

However, the RFTG was redeployed to the North African coast when it was decided to increase pressure on the Gaddafi regime through the use of Apache attack helicopters belonging to the Army Air Corps but based on HMS Ocean.

A key task forRFAFort Rosalie was to deliver a fifth Apache to HMS Ocean. In a first for theRFA, the attack helicopter was flown onto Fort Rosalie in Souda Bay, Crete.

An equally important role has been supplying ammunition to HM Ships Liverpool, Sutherland and Iron Duke to ensure their ability to deliver naval gunfire support when operating in range of the Libyan coast.

General stores to support the Task Group are brought from the UK by road and air via a forward logistic site located in southern Italy. These were then transferred to Fort Rosalie for delivery to the ships in the Task Group.

The transfer of over 200 personnel in and out of theatre, together with regular deliveries of mail, has made a big difference to morale at sea.

Despite a high tempo of operations,RFAFort Rosalie was able to take part in commemorations of the 69th anniversary of Op PEDESTAL, the Second World War convoy to relieve Malta.

Captain Hanton laid a wreath on behalf of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Service at two official ceremonies to mark this historic event.

Since the start of the year a total of 16 Royal Navy warships, submarines and Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels have contributed to humanitarian, combat and embargo operations off Libya. Two ships - the destroyer HMS Liverpool and the minehunter HMS Bangor - remain deployed.

Wherever we are and whoever we are cooking for the standards are always high.

When serving, especially in Afghanistan, you see the guys come back and they are completely drained. You can see that the highlight of their day is the food, it boosts their morale; they can recharge their batteries and it sustains them for what they have to do next.

Celebrity guests Allen Leech and Sophie McShera joined the queue to sample Senior Aircraftman Spicer’s creations. Allen, best known as Tom Branson in Downton Abbey, said of the food: “amazing, I am loving it!”

Four Royal Navy Lynx helicopters and four Army Air Corps Lynx helicopters will also operate from the ship.

The military and civilian exercise is being staged to ensure the London 2012 Olympic Games are as safe and secure as possible.

The exercise involves a wide rage of capabilities being rehearsed over a nine-day period, including the testing of air defence missile systems at sites around London and the use of the Typhoon fighters which arrived at RAF Northolt earlier this week. See Related News to read more about these.

Running from 2 to 10 May, spanning the bank holiday weekend, most of the exercise will be played out in the public domain and the military aspects of it will result in a visible presence of Armed Forces personnel, ships and aircraft.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said:

HMS Ocean’s arrival in London on the River Thames today completes the build-up of military assets and personnel taking part in Exercise Olympic Guardian over the coming days which will test the role of the Armed Forces in keeping the Games safe and secure.

The public will expect that we are ready and prepared in the unlikely event that any threat emerges. That is why Typhoon fast jets are stationed at RAF Northolt, ground-based air defences are being tested at sites across London, and helicopters and Royal Marines will be operating from HMS Ocean, the Royal Navy’s largest ship, berthed at Greenwich.

Security for the Games will be police-led, but I am proud to see the military taking a key role in the security arrangements around the world’s greatest sporting event which will be watched by billions worldwide.

During the exercise, a number of small craft will be visible on the Thames, including boats operated by Royal Marines from 539 Assault Squadron and 43 Commando Fleet Protection Group, and P2000 patrol boats. During the Games period HMS Ocean will also provide accommodation for some of the Venue Security Force working at a variety of Olympics locations.

Captain Andrew Betton, Commanding Officer of HMS Ocean, said:

As a former Commanding Officer of HMS Westminster, a ship with such great links to London, I am particularly pleased to be bringing HMS Ocean to Greenwich to be part of the Olympics, a truly once-in-a-generation event.

“HMS Ocean is the largest ship in the Royal Navy and is ideally suited to the task of supporting the police in providing security for the world’s largest, most famous sporting event.

“Everyone on board is proud to be involved in the Olympic Games and thrilled to bring our ship into the centre of London for all to see at such an important and exciting time for the city.”

Although HMS Ocean will be playing an important role in the military support to the Games, it is normal activity for the ship, which routinely prepares for operations.

Dr Murrison’s report, which was commissioned by Prime Minister David Cameron, makes a wide-ranging number of recommendations that the MOD and Department of Health will be looking to introduce.

Of these, the four principal recommendations are:

• incorporation of a structured mental health systems enquiry into existing medical examinations performed whilst serving;

• an uplift in the number of mental health professionals conducting veterans outreach work from Mental Health Trusts in partnership with a leading mental health charity;

• a Veterans Information Service to be deployed 12 months after a person leaves the Armed Forces;

• trial of an online early intervention service for serving personnel and veterans.

The contracts also include options for land management services and construction projects valued below £3.93m.

Under theDIO’s Next Generation Estate Contracts (NGEC) programme, up to four bidders have now been shortlisted for each of the three contracts (see Notes to editors for further detail). The site visits programme has been aimed at raising their knowledge and familiarity with the full span of MOD facilities and the Defence personnel that use them, prior to the intensive ‘negotiated tendering’ process.

During September and early October theNGECteams have been escorting the bidders to 28 of the 230 main establishments covered by the contracts, selected for their diversity and importance to military outputs. The bidders toured the establishments visiting key buildings and facilities along the way, ranging from office blocks and technical buildings to living accommodation and dining facilities. They also met withDIOsite representatives and military site-users to discuss their individual requirements.

Gill Hodson, the seniorNGECproject manager, said:

DIO’s priority is to support our Armed Forces as they prepare for operations. These three contracts cover significant geographical regions including a variety of key Defence bases and facilities that are vital to the delivery of military capability, and the incoming prime contractor will play an important part in this. From roofing to runways, we are determined to ensure that the bidders develop a real empathy for our military customers’ requirements, which they can then build into the development of their competitive tenders.

David McLaughlan, theNGECsenior commercial manager, said:

Good prime contractors need healthy, robust supply chain arrangements, which is why we will be exploring bidders’ plans in this area of development during this key stage in the procurement process. I would urge smaller businesses with innovative estate solutions to make their offering known to the bidders for these contracts as early as possible.

The bidders will shortly be issued with a formal invitation to engage in ‘competitive negotiation’ as they develop their Regional Prime tenders. They will also be invited to attend the Defence Academy at Shrivenham in early November for a conference on the service requirements, prior to submitting tenders in December 2012.

This will deliver a longer lasting and more cost effective capability.

Dr Fox said:

The continuous at sea deterrent is the ultimate guarantee of our national security and for the past 42 years the Royal Navy has operated continuous patrols to ensure just that.

We do not know how the international environment will change over the next 50 years and we cannot dismiss the possibility that a direct nuclear threat to the UK might emerge.

It is simply not the right time to unilaterally give this capability up. This programme of great national importance will also secure the future of one of Britain’s major manufacturing sectors.

The approval of this early phase of design - known as Initial Gate - ensures that while the main build decision for the submarines will not be taken until 2016, more detailed design work will be undertaken and long-lead items ordered so that the first submarine is delivered in 2028.

The MOD’s Director Submarines, Rear Admiral Simon Lister, said:

While the Pressurised Water Reactor used in our existing submarines is a robust, highly controlled system that meets our stringent safety standards, the new Pressurised Water Reactor 3 will deliver further improvements such as ease of operation and lower costs over its extended life.

Thousands of jobs will be secured across the country as a result of successor nuclear deterrent contracts being placed. Under this next phase, contracts are likely to cost in the region of £3bn. Overall, it is estimated that the submarines will be within the £11-14bn estimate set out in the 2006 White Paper.

As part of the Value for Money Study conducted alongside the Strategic Defence and Security Review, it was concluded that the MOD could demonstrate its commitment to disarmament by reducing the number of warheads and missiles carried on our submarines and this work is already underway.

The Coalition Government is committed to maintaining a minimum credible nuclear deterrent and policy remains that a minimum nuclear deterrent based on the Trident missile delivery system and continuous at sea deterrence is right for the UK.

The Coalition Agreement reflected the desire of the Liberal Democrats to continue to make the case for alternatives. That is why the Defence Secretary has also announced the initiation of a study to be undertaken by the Cabinet Office and overseen by the Minister of State for the Armed Forces to review the costs, feasibility and credibility of alternative systems.",Stand-up of 1 (F) Sqn and associated flypasts,Administrative,Informational,id25_945

At a ceremony held in the centre of Patrol Base 2 on Sunday morning, the flag of 5th Battalion The Rifles (5 RIFLES) was lowered and replaced with that of 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment (3 YORKS).

After the playing of the bugle, the outgoing Commanding Officer (CO), Lieutenant Colonel Tom Copinger-Symes, shook hands with the incoming CO, Lieutenant Colonel Zac Stenning, to signify the official hand over of control of the district from one battle group to the other.

The handover signifies the beginning of the six-month operational tour for the 3 YORKS Battle Group, who are due to return to the UK in November 2012.

5 RIFLES are currently returning to their home base in Paderborn, Germany.

Lt Col Copinger-Symes said:

5 RIFLES have had a successful and, dare I say it, enjoyable tour as Combined Force Nahr-e Saraj (South), supported by a huge variety of ISAF capabilities and in firm partnership with our brothers in the ANSF [Afghan National Security Forces].

We have been fortunate to see great progress, largely the product of our predecessor’s good work. We all wish 3 YORKS every success and good fortune in taking forward transition in the Nahr-e Saraj district.

Lt Col Stenning said:

We are deeply indebted to 5 RIFLES for their hard work and endeavours over the past six months. We have been gifted the perfect start, especially with regards to the excellent relationships that have been formed with the Afghan National Security Forces.

The new 1 (Fighter) Squadron [1 (F) Sqn] joins its sister unit - 6 Squadron - as the second Typhoon unit based in Scotland.

Just as in the past, the primary role of 1 (F) Sqn will be to protect the UK’s airspace as part of the Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) mission, with fighters ready around-the-clock to intercept unidentified aircraft approaching UK airspace.

The stand-up of the squadron was marked by a parade and flypast during the RAF Leuchars Air Show, one of the largest annual visitor attractions in Scotland.

Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton, was the reviewing officer for the poignant stand-up parade.

ACM Dalton said:

It is great to see such a distinguished squadron back in active service equipped with the combat-proven Typhoon.

Our Typhoon Force will continue to grow, ultimately to five squadrons, and when combined with the Tornado Force and, in due course, with our Lightning II Force, the Royal Air Force will be well placed to face the challenges of the future.

As always when I visit the RAF Leuchars Air Show I am heartened by the very real depth of support that the people of Scotland have for the Royal Air Force, for which I am most grateful.

After the stand-up parade, during which the RAF Deputy Chaplain-in-Chief consecrated a new squadron standard, three flypasts took place recognising the squadron’s proud history and new role.

A Hurricane and Spitfire from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight kicked off the display. Both aircraft were flown by 1 (F) Sqn pilots during the Second World War.

Then came a four-ship formation of Typhoons, flown by pilots from both of the Scotland-based Typhoon squadrons, to formally welcome 1 (F) Sqn to their new home at RAF Leuchars.

Finally, the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, the Red Arrows, paid the squadron their own tribute, flying over the parade in ‘Big Battle’ formation whilst trailing the squadron colours of red and white as they arrived at the Air Show.

There are now four Typhoon front line squadrons in the Royal Air Force - Numbers 3 (Fighter) and XI Squadrons are based at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire. Ultimately, the Typhoon Force will grow to five front line squadrons.

Air Officer Scotland and Station Commander of RAF Leuchars, Air Commodore Gavin Parker, said:

This is a very proud day for the Royal Air Force in Scotland. The fact that we are in a position to stand up another Typhoon squadron which will be able to share the QRA workload with 6 Squadron and develop the multi-role capabilities of Typhoon speaks volumes for the efforts of everyone here at RAF Leuchars.

Wing Commander Mark Flewin, Officer Commanding 1 (F) Sqn, said:

1 (Fighter) Squadron has a proud and distinguished history as a founder squadron in the Royal Flying Corps, a history that I am delighted we can continue to build on with Typhoon, particularly during the squadron’s centenary year.

Squadron personnel are excited about the challenge ahead and I look forward to developing and leading 1 (Fighter) Squadron as a key component of the Royal Air Force’s combat air capabilities.

And to remind people the Identity and Passport Service has launched Passport Pete, a cartoon about a man who didn’t check his passport in time and missed out on a holiday.

Figures show that parents applying for passports for their children and young people aged 16 to 20 were the two biggest groups to submit a last minute passport application.

Despite extra staff being employed by the Identity and Passport Service during summer months, there are limited numbers of appointments at passport offices for a fast track service and customers cannot always rely on a last minute call to the passport service to beat the rush.

To avoid a disappointing summer, the passport service is urging customers to apply before April to ensure they have their passport in time. They could receive their passport quicker than the advised three week period and save up to £55.50 by avoiding having to pay for premium service for a standard passport.

Sarah Rapson, Chief Executive of the Identity and Passport Service, said: ‘The Identity and Passport Service works hard each year to process more than 5.5 million applications to ensure customers can travel abroad for business or on holiday.

‘But to ensure passports remain one of the most trusted and secure documents in the world, each application takes time to process.

‘All too often people plan every other part of their holiday and forget one of the most important things - their passport. They are then forced to apply last minute, running the risk of missing out on the holiday altogether.

‘Applying early and outside the busy summer months will help ensure customers receive their passport in good time and could even save them money.’

Raquel Brooks was one such customer who booked a fast track appointment with IPS earlier this month after realising her son’s passport had expired just days before they were due to go on holiday to Portugal.

Ms Brooks said: ‘The Identity and Passport Service gave a very good and quick service and I would definitely recommend applying at this time of year.

‘I would also encourage people to check their passports are valid before booking, especially if they have children, as we could have missed out.’

From September 2012 it became even cheaper to apply for a passport with a standard adult passport dropping in price by £5 to £72.50. All other application types also reduced in price.",Availability of C-130 Hercules aircraft at RAF Brize Norton,Institutional,Other,id25_949

The live links gave British troops based in Helmand province the chance to request songs and send messages to their friends and families in the UK.

And, in the middle of the day, from 1200hrs to 1400hrs, the entire Forces world, in more than 20 countries from the Falklands to Afghanistan, joined up for a simulcast, including the UK forces audience listening to BFBS on DAB digital radio and the wider UK audience on BBC Radio 1.

A Radio 1 production team had joined BFBS Radio in Camp Bastion in the week leading up to yesterday’s unique broadcasting event to interview troops and create content for the broadcast day.

The timing of the tie-up comes as BFBS Radio is still celebrating its Sony Radio Academy Special Award made on 10 May in recognition of ‘a contribution by BFBS to the radio industry that reaches beyond the normal bounds of the awards’.

Nicky Ness, Controller of BFBS Radio, said:

Being on the ground with our Forces, living cheek-by-jowl with our audience, is what BFBS Radio is all about. The launch last year of our studio in Camp Bastion was particularly special as it is the first front line operational station to open since we launched on DAB in the UK earlier last year, so for the first time in our 65-year history we are connecting the troops in theatre live and direct with their families at home.

And this tie-up with BBC Radio 1, bringing this priceless link to the whole of the BBC Radio 1 audience, is absolutely brilliant. In one special day we can show the world what we do day-in, day-out across the Forces world.

Rhys Hughes, Executive Producer, BBC Radio 1, said:

This is the first time BBC Radio 1 has teamed up with BFBS to broadcast direct from Afghanistan and we’re proud to be working with them. Giving our servicemen and women the chance to broadcast dedications to loved ones back home is the very least we can do to support the incredibly important work they do.

BFBS had a radio station on the ground throughout the Iraq war, with its presenters often having to don body armour and hit the deck whilst on air.

Back in the UK they are on six hours’ notice to take-off, twenty-four-hours-a-day, all-year-round, and, at RAF Brize Norton, there is always a C-130 Hercules aircraft available in the event of a submarine emergency.

The week has been spent purely on parachute training and around 60 individuals have been jumping into the Bay, sometimes as often as three-times-a-day. All the Group members must learn how to jump and they come from a wide variety of backgrounds and trades.

The exercise has seen a tri-Service mix of medics, logistics specialists, radio operators, engineers, divers, and even trainee parachute instructors, taking part. There is an equally wide range of parachute experience, with seven members of the Group having performed only their first-ever jumps this week.

Exercise Gib Splash is also an important training event for the aircrew themselves. They need to learn how to fly as low as 1,000 feet (305m) over a precise target, and with parachutists jumping from the tailgate. And, finally, the exercise allows the boat crews on the water to gain additional water safety qualifications. Lieutenant Jan Ziolo, SPAG’s Officer Commanding, said:

Gibraltar is ideal for this kind of training.

We get huge support from Headquarters British Forces, the weather and the sea states are usually good, and, of course, we can achieve a very fast turnaround from the sea back to the airfield. We don’t waste any time at all.

Chief Petty Officer Neil Stevenson, the exercise co-ordinator, said:

We plan to come back in July to rehearse the other part of the operation - that of building a floating triage and medical centre.

This is the first time I have ever organised this exercise and I am very happy with the way that it has gone.

Lieutenant Ziolo added:

We are very grateful for all the help that has been given to us. We are very aware that our exercise coincided with Exercise GIBEX, so we are particularly grateful to everyone here.","Morale boxes from Sainsbury's, cakes from the Women's Institute, scones from the Fuchsia Restaurant",Other,Informational,id25_952
953,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ross-kemp-returns-to-helmand,News story,Ross Kemp returns to Helmand,"Five years after Ross Kemp seamlessly morphed from jobbing actor to BAFTA-award-winning documentary maker, he has few regrets: 


  “I think…",Ministry of Defence,14 November 2011,"Five years after Ross Kemp seamlessly morphed from jobbing actor to BAFTA-award-winning documentary maker, he has few regrets:

I think enjoying a Winnebago and a bacon sandwich every morning as opposed to being kicked awake to go on patrol with the Royal Marines after a camel spider tried to eat me all night is appealing,” he says.

But I really enjoy what I do. It’s very fulfilling, particularly the loyalty among the friends that I’ve made through doing this, who will hopefully stick with me for the rest of my life. We’ve got some ‘dits’ [stories] to spin - which I probably wouldn’t have had if I’d stayed an actor, and I certainly wouldn’t have met as many interesting people.

Kemp’s new five-part series on Afghanistan marks the 10th anniversary of 9/11 and British troops’ arrival in Helmand, and he is brimful of facts and figures:

It’s the longest war we’ve been involved in since the Second World War and it’s the most expensive in financial terms,” he says.

Five years ago, Kemp stepped off a plane in stifling heat on Operation HERRICK 6 and spent time with 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment, accompanying the troops on the front line. Now he is back, following the fate of 45 Commando Royal Marines to find out what has changed in the ten years ISAF forces have been in Afghanistan.

The programme covers six months, with Kemp examining bin Laden’s legacy, meeting warlords and tribal elders, and pounding the patrols with the Bootnecks.

Ross Kemp is blunt, fiercely intelligent and opinionated, but the real surprise is that his speech is peppered with military jargon: ‘dits’, ‘scoff’, ‘scran’ and ‘contacts’. He explains that the new series is about the story of why British troops went into Afghanistan and explores some of the early mistakes made:

We weren’t equipped as well as we should have been. We didn’t have enough soldiers to do the job. We were also pretty culturally unaware, with a lot of the mistakes made on the ground.

On his latest visit he also spent time with the US Marine Corps and gained access to Lieutenant General William Caldwell, the Commander of NATO’s Training Mission - Afghanistan, tasked with training Afghan soldiers and police. And Kemp says that it’s the ability of the Afghan Army and Police to keep out the insurgents after 2014 that will be the real litmus test:

We’ve got three years so a lot can happen,” he says. Pause. “I should say they have got three years,” he grins as the meaning of what he’s just said sinks in.

How can you ever take a police statement or call in an attack helicopter if you can’t even write your own name?” asks Kemp, adding that in the war-torn country, where corruption is a problem and many can’t even read or write, the answers are far from black and white.

There are massive issues and it is indicative of General Caldwell that he sees it as important to teach these people to read and write rather than load a rifle.

The new TV series shows how much the strategy for dealing with the insurgency has been transformed. Kemp says:

Rather than taking out the guy on the ground with a 200-pound bomb which we used to do, we now follow him back, see where he lives, see where his contacts are, and hopefully find the boss who gives him instructions way up the command and remove him, therefore saving far more ISAF and UK lives.

To prove his point, he examines how much the situation on the ground has changed:

Our area of operation has shrunk by nearly 80 per cent from being half of the UK to the size of Kent. But we’ve still got the same number of policemen on the ground, which makes it very hard for the Taliban, which is maybe one reason why the number of attacks has dropped.

Kemp also describes how the complexities of Afghanistan’s famously tribal land add up to a Spook’s nightmare:

You can have a family in Helmand that soldiers are trying to profile,” he explains. “One member could be in the Afghan Army, one could be in the Police, two could be in the Taliban, one is a narcotics smuggler and the other five could all be farmers, so the complexities don’t bear thinking about. Trying to identify all the riot suspects in the UK was difficult enough, so imagine trying to do it in a war zone.

Since his last visit, Kemp has seen dramatic improvements in body armour, ‘pelvic protection’, helmets, weapon systems and food that have given UK troops a morale-boosting lift.

As this story is being posted online, 385 British troops have lost their lives in Afghanistan. Does Kemp consider the sacrifice worth it?

I can’t say that,” he says firmly. “That is down for the families to decide and hopefully the Afghans who will be able to stand up on their own two feet after we leave. I can say that I’ve never not been impressed by the professionalism, integrity and bravery of the British soldier and marine.

Over the course of the series, Kemp oozes ice-cool courage, ducking in a ditch as bullets crack just inches over his head. He wasn’t even daunted when he met the Taliban because the previous two series had already hooked them in:

They are very media savvy and want to get their point across, and hopefully they trust us to know we would give them that opportunity,” says Kemp.

Expressing firm opinions on why the Taliban should be given air time he adds:

There is no way that the solution to Afghanistan will come at the end of a rifle. It will come through negotiations and undoubtedly the Taliban have to be involved, so the sooner we start listening to what they believe, what they want, the sooner we will hopefully come to a settlement. They weren’t cliches. They have beards and they wear black turbans but they are all individuals.

Kemp also believes that no-one should be thinking about trying to turn Afghanistan into a completely democracy-embracing country:

They are Afghans and they live the Afghan way. It will never be the same as ours, and why should it be? But it would be a heck of a waste of time and life if we leave that country and things haven’t improved. But I’m hoping and praying that they will.

As an actor, you sense that Kemp adapts to his surroundings like a chameleon:

I am always for whichever team I’m with at the time, so if I’m with a load of Rangers fans, I’m a Rangers fan,” he confesses. “I found the Marines to be very welcoming. They do good scran but the Army does good scoff,” he says, deftly underlining his point.

You also get the feeling that down-to-earth Kemp is equally at home chatting to private soldiers as he is with the Chief of the Defence Staff, whom he admires:

To me, General Richards is a soldier’s soldier, an airman’s airman and a sailor’s sailor. He knows it from top to bottom and doesn’t lay it on thick which is important when you’re that important.

Kemp’s strength is his own everyman appeal and he has made lasting friendships aplenty that are on speed dial:

Of course, all the way through,” he nods. “When you share life experiences you stay friends.

As we wind up our interview, I ask him to share an abiding moment from Afghanistan:

Coming home to Brize Norton and seeing patterns of beautiful colours of the British countryside as I fly over is always something that warms my heart.

Yet he also treasures the camaraderie and humour, even under fire:

I have never laughed so much in my life as when I was shot at with those guys. It was a natural reaction of coping with danger.

He recalls a pivotal moment after a friendly fire attack from an earlier series when three soldiers were killed while Kemp was back in the UK. Eight days later, the company were sent to Sangin to recuperate, and when Kemp returned to the front line, he met the men of B Company and 7 Platoon to tell the story of how they were affected:

They lived in the back of an old shed and we stayed with them for four days,” says Kemp. “It was cathartic because they started talking and it was an amazing moment as we saw those guys come to terms with what happened. They treated us as friends. It’s things like that that will stay with me. It’s incredible how much it bonds you.

They had been out on the ground for nine hours when they were contacted by heavy machine gun fire from a tree line just a couple of hundred metres away. Forty kilogrammes of kit per man, and tired after hours on the ground, yet their reactions were as sharp as they always are.

They returned fire, got themselves into cover and fought the battle. It was afterwards when everyone was back at the patrol base and brews had been drunk that I sat and chatted with Dave - or ‘Shanky’ as he is known - and Phil.

Dave joined the Army 17 years ago and is full to the brim with banter and self-confidence. But a couple of months back I saw, in a time of rare transparency, the man that has made Dave such a fine medic and such great company.

When an old man brought his grandson into camp, scared of the insurgent repercussions of his doing so, Dave poured such care, attention and compassion on the little lad and the old man that I found it hard to speak.

The lad had lost a leg in an insurgent improvised explosive device explosion a year back and he had an infection in the stump. There was silence in the medical centre as the doctor and Dave did what they could for the brave little fellow, even finding him a colouring book.

There was just the slightest squeak and a determined grimace when the infected area hurt as they tried to pinpoint the problem. And all the time the sad but grateful eyes of the old man looked over his charge as he waited.

When the treatment was over I was invited in to meet the couple. When the interpreter explained to the grandfather that I was a Christian religious leader, he smiled, and stood, and held my hand tightly as we shared a moment - inconvenient to those who would divide and hate and judge, but which celebrated the many, many things we held in common in that moment:

He says he is glad to meet you and is very grateful for the care your doctor has shown the boy,” the interpreter said, echoing the quiet, deep, almost lyrical words of the old man.

I am honoured to meet you, and this very brave young man,” was all I could muster in reply.

Whilst we were speaking, Dave had found some strong glue and was fixing his young patient’s shoe. His silence throughout speaking volumes.

As the little lad was carried to the gate by Hugh, so strong the little lad was no weight in his arms, Dave took a deep breath, grinned, shrugged his shoulders and in an instant was back to his public self.

But I know what I had always suspected and the blokes in the unit have experienced time and time again - Dave is a hugely compassionate man.

As Dave, Phil and I sat on our camp cots, it was Dave who spoke first:

That was just a bit too close,” he said.

He looked at Phil, a sniper, and on his third tour of Afghanistan.

I could taste the lead,” Phil replied. A 7.62mm round from the insurgent machine gun had whistled past his face so close that it had filled his senses.

Too, too close.

There was the grin that excitement brings on Phil’s face, but behind it was the story of a man who had known ‘close’ before. He reached for the chain around his neck. On it two items hung, one a St Christopher, the second a misshapen round:

That’s the one that got me in the plate in 2006, Padre. Too close, not that much fun.

We talked about the whole of the patrol, from me standing on the helicopter landing site with them in the middle of the night to see them off, to the various tasks they had completed during the day, to the contact itself, and then to this time of pulling it together, of remembering, reflecting, reviewing. It helped everyone involved to process what they had been through in the context of the whole day, the wider tour, and even their life and career in the Army.

I have seen too often people’s lives held captive by a single event. It can be that a few minutes, or seconds even, can be the reference point from which they view themselves and the world, far beyond the reach you might expect.

Talking about it seems to help though; friends and colleagues can bring a greater, wider perspective to something that could otherwise become all-encompassing.

Sometimes the talk can turn to God and faith and purpose, but often it doesn’t. The process, however, is cathartic and always worthwhile. It is a funny thing, but in a world that seems so enthusiastic about the gossip of ‘he said this’ and ‘she said that’ and of the cringing details of celebrities’ lives, I wonder whether what we could really do with is talking a little bit more about our own experiences; how we have seen things that affect us; how perhaps our perspective is not the only one; how we feel as a result.

It is the essential process of knowing and being known, of relationship, of feeling what we do and who we are is valued; which is, of course, also at the heart of a living, active faith.

Phil and Dave did not dwell on the events of the day and we certainly didn’t get all analytical about things, but we shared some time and some laughs and a few excitements and in doing so much more than the sum of the words. And then it was to doss bags and some well-earned kip, because for these lads, it would be the same again tomorrow.",Engagement with the Muslim community on all aspects of policy,Other,,id25_954

He is a member of the Police Advisory Training Team in Nad ‘Ali, where he is using all of the skills he has amassed over a 32-year career with the Devon and Cornwall Police Force to train and mentor the Afghan National Security Forces.

Lt Col Ward said:

The culture of the local people is rich and fascinating. Security here is improving by the day which is a tribute to the Afghan police and the ISAF troops who are partnering and mentoring them.

The experience acquired during two tours of Iraq and one of Bosnia prior to his deployment to Afghanistan has given Lt Col Ward the ideal background to pass on a career’s worth of experience to a willing audience. Lt Col Ward’s team is made up of specialist police advisers and military trainers from the Royal Anglian Regiment and the Welsh Guards.

Lt Col Ward said:

Being able to impart knowledge and advice to the Chief of Police in order to help him build a sustainable and professional force in the Helmand Valley is the main thrust of my work here.

What has taken me by surprise has been the warmth and generosity of the Afghan people. Things are getting better for the locals as improvements in security have led to an increase in prosperity in the area. Roads are being built, schools opened and bazaars trading all the time so that farmers can sell their goods. This economic prosperity has eased the hardships that they have had to endure for a long time.

Lt Col Ward is currently halfway through a 12-month posting in Afghanistan and will be home on leave soon to see his wife, Linda, and three children, Kerenza, aged 22, Eythyn, 19, and Myron, 15.

In Newton Abbot Lt Col Ward and his family are keen volunteers and all three of his children serve alongside him in St John Ambulance where he is a senior volunteer for youth leadership in Devon.

Lt Col Ward has had support throughout the tour from his home town and has stated just how surprised and humbled he is by the generosity of the fantastic people of Newton Abbot. He said:

I have had morale boxes from Sainsbury’s. The Women’s Institute in Ipplepen have sent me cakes and the Fuchsia Restaurant has been sending me scones, all of which have been received very well. It is a tremendous boost to know that the people of Newton Abbot are giving their support.

When Lt Col Ward’s year-long tour of duty is over early next year he will be presented with his Operational Service Medal by Lord and Lady Clifford at Ugbrooke House. He said:

It will be an honour to be awarded the medal by Lord and Lady Clifford.

‘As citizens of the UK, you will have your own individual hopes, needs and concerns on many areas of government policy, just like everybody else,’ she said.

The Home Secretary, who is also Minister for Women and Equalities, said the Muslim community has achieved a great deal in recent years, pointing to the first ever female Muslim cabinet minister - Baroness Warsi - as evidence of significant progress in national politics.This adds, she said, to a proud tradition of involvement in local politics: ‘Let us all hope that … more young Muslims become involved in British politics in all parties and at all levels’.

She said that central to the coalition government are the ideas of ‘freedom, fairness and responsibility,’ and said progress has already been made on the freedom agenda by steps taken to scrap ID cards.Counter-terrorism powers will also be reviewed to ensure a balance between public safety and civil liberties. ‘We will get the balance right,’ she promised.

Ms May explained that integration is another important aspect of the government’s agenda: ‘We believe in people throughout our country, from all communities, coming together, working together, supporting and trusting each other’.Part of the drive for integration, she asserted, is challenging extremists ‘who oppose this and want to drive us apart’.

The Home Secretary said she was delighted to celebrate Eid, but of this year’s celebration was tinged with sadness following the recent floods in Pakistan.

In early May, as part of a military exercise, unarmed equipment was put in place at the six proposed sites for a period of nine days. This saw the air security plan tested extensively and confirmed the utility and integration of the various elements.

As a result, based on military advice, the Government has now agreed to the deployment of ground-based air defence systems - including Rapier and high velocity missile systems - at the six locations for the duration of the Games.

The systems will be in place by mid-July, along with other Defence equipment including Royal Navy helicopter carrier HMS Ocean, which will be moored in the River Thames, Royal Air Force Typhoon jets, which will be temporarily stationed at RAF Northolt, and Puma helicopters at a Territorial Army centre in Ilford.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said:

Whilst there is no reported threat to the London Olympics, the public expects that we put in place a range of measures aimed at ensuring the safety and security of this once-in-a-generation event. Ground-based air defence [GBAD] systems will form just one part of a comprehensive, multi-layered air security plan which, I believe, will provide both reassurance and a powerful deterrent.

We have undertaken a wide programme of engagement with the communities affected, involving relevant local authorities, landowners, MPs, council leaders and community meetings. These have shown that, while people understandably have questions and concerns which we have sought to answer, broadly speaking communities are supportive of our work.

A small number of activists object to the deployment of these defensive measures and a legal challenge to the Government’s decision to deploy GBAD has been initiated. The MOD will defend these proceedings vigorously and is confident of defeating them.

Home Secretary Theresa May said:

Our focus is to deliver an Olympic and Paralympic Games that London, the UK and the world can enjoy. The Games should be a peaceful celebration of sporting achievement and cultural celebration.

But this is the biggest sporting event in the world, and with that comes the huge responsibility to deliver it safely and securely. We are working to a robust safety and security strategy and we will leave nothing to chance.

The police and emergency services have substantial experience of major events and will bring this to bear with support from the military. Our approach is intelligence-led and risk-based, and flexible to respond to changes between now and the Games.

Collectively, the systems include a range of air defence capabilities, including radar and detection equipment as well as weapons, which will provide a powerful deterrent and protection against the threat of an attack from the air. Similar systems have been deployed at all recent Olympic Games.

Some 100 sites were considered as part of early planning but this was narrowed down to the six final sites which were deemed to offer the best possible protection to the Olympic Park and surrounding area against any air threat.

The sites, and the specific systems to be deployed at them, are:

• Lexington Building, Fairfield Road, Bow, Tower Hamlets - High Velocity Missile• Fred Wigg Tower, Montague Road Estate, Waltham Forest - High Velocity Missile• Blackheath Common, Blackheath (Lewisham/Greenwich) - Rapier• William Girling Reservoir, Lea Valley Reservoir Chain, Enfield - Rapier• Oxleas Meadow, Shooters Hill, Greenwich/Woolwich - Rapier• Barn Hill, Netherhouse Farm, Epping Forest - Rapier.",,Other,,id25_958

The recipients of the award, drawn from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, the Ministry of Defence Hospital Unit Portsmouth, and from the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre Headley Court, were consultant nurse Debby Edwards, trauma sister Victoria Mulleady, Sergeant Lauren Odell RAF, Surgeon Commander Sarah Stapley, clinical specialist occupational therapist Sarah Winters, and clinical specialist physiotherapist Kate Sherman, who was unable to attend the event.

Birmingham-based medic Sergeant Odell found herself seated next to the Home Secretary and Minister for Women and Equality, Theresa May, at the ceremony. Sergeant Odell was based at Selly Oak before moving over to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Dealing with gunshot wounds and blast injuries in military patients alongside her civilian patients is all in a day’s work for the trauma specialist and staff nurse.

Speaking after the ceremony, Sergeant Odell said the highlight of the event was having the team award presented by two of her former patients, Captain Martin Hewitt and Private Jaco van Gass of the Parachute Regiment, in an emotional reunion. Private van Gass suffered serious injuries in an improvised explosive device blast in Afghanistan and Sergeant Odell cared for him during his recovery at Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham.

The pair told Sergeant Odell how appreciative they were of the nursing care she provided and that it was a pleasure to be able to present the award in person.

Sergeant Odell spent four months in Afghanistan in her aeromedical role. Asked how important her work is with injured troops, she said:

It is incredibly important. It gives us a great sense of job satisfaction. Seeing my patients today doing so well … after what they have been through is an amazing surprise. I’m not ashamed to admit I shed a tear!

Sergeant Odell said it had been a shock when she first heard of the nomination from her Officer Commanding:

Winning the Barclays Women of the Year Award is a great honour and we are so touched to be recognised for the day-to-day job that we love,” she said.

Our aim is to provide the best care possible for the military and civilian patients whom we treat, and to be nominated means so much, as it was truly unexpected.

The award reflects the work that we all do as a team at Birmingham and to remember that it reflects on all of us, and not just us as individuals,” she added.

Sergeant Odell recently completed a four-year posting at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine, providing acute nursing care for injured soldiers.

Today, 18 October 2011, Sergeant Odell starts a new job at RAF Lyneham’s Tactical Medical Wing:

I will be working as a flight nurse picking up patients from all around the world as a medical escort, and providing nursing support on the soldiers’ journey back to the UK,” she said.

This award gives me added courage and conviction to take on this new challenge and to strive to continue to deliver the care that our troops so rightly deserve,” she added.

Baroness Helena Kennedy QC, President of the Women of the Year, said:

These six brilliant, professional and talented women represent the many more personnel who carry out such fantastic work at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham and with our forces overseas.

This year marks the 10th anniversary of the war in Afghanistan, and Women of the Year recognises the hard work, determination and outstanding medical achievements of women working in this most challenging of fields.

Sarah Winters, clinical specialist occupational therapist, said:

It is a privilege to be recognised for this award. I am only a small part of a very dedicated rehabilitation team and we all take great pride in the work that we do.

At the lunch, hosted by Sandi Toksvig, four other special awards were presented to exceptional women who have each proved an inspiration to others through their courage, talent and achievements, and included singer Lulu and charity campaigner Katie Piper.

The winners are selected by a diverse cross-section of women represented on the nominating council, comprising prominent figures from the arts, media, science, politics and other major fields, including Maureen Lipman, Sue MacGregor, Mary Nightingale, Doreen Lawrence and Virginia Wade.","Co-locating different ranks is a relatively new idea and produced various design challenges.

The first two Voyager aircraft underwent conversion at Airbus Military’s facility in Getafe, Spain.

The remaining 12 future Voyager aircraft, a variant of the A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport, will be converted at the Bournemouth facility.

In all, the RAF will operate a fleet of 14 Voyagers by the second half of this decade to replace its existing fleets of TriStar and VC10 aerial refuelling aircraft.

Representatives from the UK Ministry of Defence, Airbus Military, AirTanker and other key companies attended, including Air Marshal Kevin Leeson, Chief of Materiel (Air), who said:

The conversions carried out at this tremendous new Cobham facility will turn Airbus A330s into the most capable military tanker transport aircraft of its type in the world, the third of which we are celebrating the arrival of.

Voyager will provide enhanced levels of availability, reliability and comfort for its passengers. Its 4,000-mile [6,400km] range, carrying 285 passengers and freight, will allow the UK to respond to world events with great speed.

The air-to-air refuelling systems will provide access to an impressive 111-tonne fuel capacity and enable Voyager to refuel a large variety of platforms, from Typhoon jets to A400M transports.

The Voyager conversion effort will create and maintain in excess of 100 direct jobs at Cobham into 2016, to be further increased through indirect jobs.

The activity also provides an excellent opportunity to train graduates and apprentices and help prepare them for a career in aerospace engineering.

Des Taylor, General Manager of Cobham Aviation Services, said:

Cobham looks forward to playing a key role in the AirTanker supply chain by providing and embodying its state-of-the-art air refuelling systems into the very capable A330 platform.

He was born in 1924 in Liskeard in Cornwall, and attended Liskeard Church School and worked in the Co-Op before enlisting in the Army in Colchester on 4 March 1943.

In September 1944, the 4th and 5th Battalions of The Wiltshire Regiment took part in Operation Market Garden, the allied drive to capture a series of bridges over key rivers in Holland to allow an advance over the Rhine and into the industrial heartland of Germany.

After the airborne landings on 17 September, the 5th Battalion was ordered forward to Nijmegen and moved up the captured road, known as the ‘corridor’, to the city. As the days passed it became apparent that Operation Market Garden was not going to succeed as hoped, and the advancing British forces, including the 5th Battalion, began to dig in.

On 27 September, B Company took up a defensive position at De Laar Farm just west of a crossing over the north-south Nijmegen-Arnhem railway line, which was held by D Company.

The first three days of the battalion’s occupation of the area were quiet, with occasional shelling and some sightings of German troops to the north and east. But on Sunday 1 October the artillery barrage began in earnest, and the battalion had to call in mortar and artillery fire to fend off an attack by German tanks and infantry.

The German forces then withdrew to regroup, and at 0330hrs on the morning of Monday 2 October attacked again in earnest.

D Company’s position was hit hardest, and two-thirds of its men were forced to withdraw to B Company’s position at the farm.

The Germans followed with a tank attack and artillery bombardment on the farm. B Company fought fiercely to repel the attack, but in the fighting about half of the men in both B and D Companies were killed or injured, among them Private Lewis Curtis of B Company.

The fighting continued into the next day, with the remnants of B and D Companies mounting a successful counter-attack supported by tanks to recapture the 5th Battalion’s forward positions. The 5th Battalion was relieved by the 4th Battalion later that day.

Private Curtis was buried in a field grave at De Laar Farm, but grave markers were washed away when German military engineers blew up a dyke on the River Rhine to flood the area, leaving the resting place of Private Curtis unmarked.

Then, during excavations in 2003, when the area was being cleared to make way for a housing estate, Private Curtis’s remains were discovered. The Royal Netherlands Army’s Recovery and Identification Unit were able to identify his remains from dental records in 2008 and preserved them for reinterment.",Air Security Plan,Legislative,Administrative,id25_961

The building, which was constructed by CarillionEnterprise, DE’s Regional Prime Contractor (RPC) for the central region, includes 24 single living bedspaces in an integrated annex, representing a new approach to the provision of Single Living Accommodation.

Co-locating different ranks is a relatively new idea and produced various design challenges. These were met with an integrated solution, whereby two separate messes within the same building are served by one central kitchen. Sharing a central resource in this unconventional way is very cost-effective for the station.

Squadron Leader Steve Fulcher, RAF Valley, said:

Alongside other projects aimed at improving the standard of living of our personnel, this project is already having a huge impact on life at RAF Valley for our senior non-commissioned officers and junior ranks.

Mess members are already making best use and are taking great pride in the facility. The very positive reaction from those now using the mess has proved the true value of collaboration between DE, end users, estates requirement staff and contractors.

The upper sections of all three masts, the bowsprit, booms, yards and spars, 768 wooden blocks - some of them 100 years old - and 26 miles (42km) of rigging (enough to stretch from Portsmouth to Littlehampton) will be carefully removed by experts, and catalogued and documented, assisting future restorers of Victory when she needs work doing again.

The last time the legendary ship was minus her masts was in 1944. Victory received damage to her hull during a Luftwaffe bombing raid on the dockyard in 1941, and the masts were removed to prevent further damage in any subsequent raids.

Fortunately, HMS Victory survived the war and is still a serving Royal Navy vessel. The oldest ship still in commission with any navy in the world, she acts as the flagship of the Second Sea Lord, has a Royal Navy ship’s company and frequently hosts official events from ceremonies to dinners.

A ten-year restoration programme is planned for the ship, with an interactive exhibition soon opening in the neighbouring National Museum of the Royal Navy showing how Victory was built in Chatham 250 years ago, how she has been cared for since during her active career, and, more recently, as one of the nation’s most treasured historical icons.

Professor Dominic Tweddle, Director General of the National Museum of the Royal Navy, said:

Preserving a wooden warship is a battle - a battle against nature, and, just as epic, in its way, as the Battle of Trafalgar. To be able to witness how that battle is fought will be a big draw for visitors.

Both Victory and the museum will remain open to the public throughout the restoration work.

Most of the highly-skilled restoration work will be carried out by master shipwrights and other specialists from BAE Systems who are also currently working on the Royal Navy’s supercarrier HMS Queen Elizabeth at Portsmouth Naval Base.

As well as possessing the cutting-edge skills required to build the 65,000-tonne supercarriers, the workers also maintain the traditional wooden shipbuilding skills required to look after Nelson’s flagship.

The exercise takes place from 20 to 22 March and, over the three days, the forces will practise detecting and intercepting an aircraft that intrudes into restricted airspace.

The Air Security Plan for the Olympic Games builds on the Royal Air Force’s existing defence of UK airspace, which includes round-the-clock radar surveillance and Typhoon fighters held at high readiness every day of the year.

The exercise integrates the additional forces being used to ensure the safety of the Olympics, as part of the Ministry of Defence’s role to ensure a safe and secure Games this summer. These include RAF Puma aircraft - together with Royal Navy and Army Lynx helicopters - carrying teams of RAF Regiment snipers to intercept aircraft in restricted airspace, and airborne surveillance aircraft including Royal Navy Sea King Airborne Surveillance and Control helicopters and RAF E-3D Sentry aircraft.

On the ground, the RAF is providing additional mobile ground radar systems, while the Army is deploying air observers and Rapier and Starstreak missile systems, which also provide additional detection capability, though a final decision on their deployment has yet to be taken.

Armed forces personnel will be joined by officers from the Metropolitan Police, who are leading security for the whole Games. Military activity, including the Air Security Plan, supports the overall police operation, so the exercise is a chance for both the police and military to learn more about how the other operates.

Air Commodore Gary Waterfall, the Deputy Air Component Commander, said:

Whilst there is no specific threat to the Games, we have to be ready for whatever occurs and play our part in what will be a safe and secure Olympics for all to enjoy.

Our multi-layered security plan means that we have a range of responses available to us, ensuring we can deal appropriately with anything from redirecting an aircraft that may have strayed into restricted airspace, to preventing an attack.

It is intended that the UK will provide the majority of manpower at the Academy and are seeking a partner nation or nations to support us in this task.

Announcing the withdrawal of 500 UK troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2012 yesterday, Mr Cameron also said:

In Afghanistan I announced plans for a new officer training academy. This was something President Karzai specifically asked me for, and I am proud that Britain is able to deliver it.

We intend to lead the Academy from 2013, in addition to maintaining our current role in the Officer Candidate School which is due to merge with the Academy in 2017.

The UK Armed Forces are world leaders in officer training and are pleased to be able to use their expertise to develop a programme of instruction for the Afghans which will help to develop an enduringly capable Afghan National Army.

It is envisioned that the UK will provide around 75 per cent of the international trainers at the Academy which will amount to around 100 officers plus necessary medical and logistical support elements. This UK manpower commitment will diminish over time as the Afghans begin to take over the lead in the Academy.

The trainers will run one-year courses for the Afghans based around the Royal Military College Sandhurst model, to teach ANA officers leadership and tactical skills.

The Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir David Richards, said yesterday:

I welcome the Prime Minister’s pledge of officer training to the Afghan military.

The UK’s model for officer development is respected across the world, and I am very proud to be able to offer assistance to the Afghan National Army to develop the command and leadership that is so vital to a professional and effective military. It will secure the enduring military relationship between our two nations, and will ensure the enemies of Afghanistan will meet a formidable professional security force.

NTM-A is funding the building of the Academy and will meet the future running costs and Afghan student costs.

Under current arrangements, the vast majority of Afghan officers are trained at the Officer Candidate School in Kabul, with a small proportion - the top 10 per cent - undertaking a four-year West Point (leading US Military Academy in New York) style academic course at the US-led National Military Academy of Afghanistan.

This model has worked well and has allowed large numbers of Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) to be trained over the past few years. But the NTM-A recognises that the throughput of the ANSF will reduce as the size of the force stabilises. It therefore makes sense to revise the way training is delivered and to develop a longer course for officers - which will be delivered at the new Academy.","Deployment of HMS Bulwark and other naval assets (patrol boats, Merlins) in Portland Harbour and the Thames Estuary",Institutional,"Other (Strategic plans, consultations)",id25_965

It fell to HMS Liverpool to shepherd the ship on the final leg of the historic journey, with the Libyan sailors and soldiers on board enthusiastically waving and shouting thanks from the frigate’s upper deck.

As the Al Hani became visible on the horizon, Free Libya flags flying, it was clear that not only her ship’s company were on board - the upper deck was crowded.

This is a significant milestone in the rebel campaign - to take a former Gaddafi warship into the capital, until very recently held by Gaddafi, shows the extent of the achievement by the Libyan people.

This is one of the first steps to the establishment of a stable and secure country, free from the Gaddafi regime.

The ship is the only Libyan frigate in working order. The Russian-built warship fell into Free Libya Forces hands when Benghazi was seized during the opening moves of the civil war. Her sister ship, the Al Ghardabia, was knocked out by an RAF air strike in Tripoli harbour.

It is a multinational endeavour and exists to create a lawful and stable maritime environment free from terrorism, smuggling and piracy. Her principal mission was to deter, disrupt and defeat such actions.

On her homecoming on Friday, HMS Somerset’s Commanding Officer, Commander Paul Bristowe, said:

It is fantastic to be met by hundreds of families and friends on the jetty. The crew deserve this moment from their families who have been so hugely supportive which is appreciated so much by us all.

My ship’s company have been really professional, enabling the ship to conduct effective maritime policing operations including counter-piracy and counter-smuggling.

“One of the incidents came about when we came across a ship in which the crew had been effectively taken captive by pirates. We secured the vessel from the pirates and released the captured Pakistani crew.

As well as disrupting two piracy acts we also rescued two separate crews in distress on the high seas. This was very rewarding and exactly why we were there and what we have trained for.

At the head of the queue of waiting family members, to meet her husband Chief Petty Officer Rob Lawes as he disembarked in privileged third place, was Leanne Lawes with their first child - 15-week-old son Daniel dressed in a sailor suit specially made by his mother for the happy occasion. Chief Petty Officer Lawes said:

It’s wonderful to see Daniel again. Leanne has done so well looking after him. Mind you I was lucky enough that the Navy flew me home to be there at his birth. Others have had to wait until today to see their families. It is a great day for everyone.

Julie Gale was overjoyed to see her daughter Leading Medical Assistant Donna Gale again following her first deployment on operations.

Her incident-packed time on Somerset included looking after a patient in Tanzania and giving medical cover to a football match in Saudi Arabia. Julie said:

Donna’s had a really busy time on her first ship. It’s brilliant to see her again.

HMS Somerset remained at sea for up to six weeks continuously at any one time and visited Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Tanzania and the Seychelles.

Whilst in various ports the crew engaged with their host nations in a variety of ways ranging from comparing maritime security tactics to playing football; all of which served to strengthen international co-operation based on the shared need to protect maritime trade routes.

Petty Officer Jamie Newman hugged his children Evie, seven, and Owyn, ten, who were delighted to see their father again. Evie said her dad was taking her to Brownies - the first time he had been able to. Owyn is looking forward to football football with his father. Their mother Lisa said:

Although it has been hard keeping these two [children] occupied, Jamie is back and that more than makes up for everything.

Petty Officer Newman said:

The deployment has been successful, especially with counter-piracy ops. It is tough being away from my family, but this is a wonderful welcome home.

Powerful and versatile with the capability to operate anywhere in the world, the Type 23 frigate is the mainstay of the Royal Navy’s surface fleet. The 13 Type 23 frigates form half of the frigate/destroyer force in the Royal Navy.

Originally designed for the principal task of anti-submarine warfare, they have evolved into multi-purpose ships. As well as warfare roles, these ships conduct embargo operations using boarding teams, disaster relief work and surveillance operations.

The ship’s crew is now on leave before returning to prepare the ship for a lengthy in-depth refit - her having deployed four times for six-months in the past five years.

From her operations room, Bulwark will direct the movements of Royal Marines raiding craft, patrol boats and civilian launches and boats, and be fed live imagery of the waters around Weymouth by special cameras fitted to Fleet Air Arm Merlin helicopters on patrol overhead.

The flagship has relieved Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel Mounts Bay which has spent the past month providing office administrative support and accommodation facilities for small boat crews, docking and maintenance facilities for raiding craft, planning rooms for Navy logistics staff, and offices and briefing rooms for police and 43 Commando Fleet Protection Group Royal Marines.

Mounts Bay is now moving a short distance along the coast to Bournemouth in time for the town’s air festival, where she’ll be taking part in an amphibious assault display.

As for Bulwark, she’ll be alongside in Portland Harbour for the duration of the Paralympics - unlike the Olympics when she was ‘parked’ in Weymouth Bay.

Once again Bulwark will be aided by Merlins of 814 Naval Air Squadron; the latter were airborne for 12-hours-a-day during the Olympics as they kept an eye on shipping movements off the Dorset coast.

The Merlins returned to base at Culdrose during the interlude between the Olympic and Paralympic Games, while Bulwark sailed back to Devonport to host a families’ day:

I’m really proud of our people,” said Commander Kevin Rowlands, Bulwark’s Second-in-Command.

Working with the police, Maritime and Coastguard Agency, the Border Agency and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games is not normal business for us and the team has risen to the challenge.

It has been great to be part of the Games and we are all looking forward to helping out at the Paralympics. I hope that we get to meet some of the Paralympic athletes - they are the real heroes.

Dorset Police’s Assistant Chief Constable, Adrian Whiting, said that over the first phase of Operation OLYMPICS the combined military-civilian team had worked ‘superbly well’ during what was the ‘largest maritime policing operation ever’ in the UK.

In addition to Bulwark in Portland, the Royal Navy’s biggest warship, HMS Ocean, remains on the Thames supporting events in the capital, serving as a helicopter launch pad and floating accommodation for some of the military personnel assigned to Operation OLYMPICS.

On Monday, the Prime Minister announced his intention to be personally involved; he will chair the inaugural meeting of the committee in the New Year.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond confirmed the arrangements announced by the PM earlier in the week as he delivered an interim report on the Armed Forces Covenant to Parliament today.

The report outlines the progress the Government has made on upholding previous pledges the Government made in May 2010 as part of its desire to repair the Armed Forces Covenant.

The new committee will work closely with the Covenant Reference Group, an existing body which gives key stakeholders such as other government departments, charities and the Service Families’ Federations the opportunity to monitor progress and raise issues on behalf of Service personnel, their families and veterans.

Prime Minister David Cameron said:

Our Armed Forces do so much to keep us safe. That’s why this government has enshrined the principles of the Military Covenant in law. This new committee is about doing more to make the Covenant work - making sure that throughout their daily lives our troops, their families and veterans get all the help and support they need and in the coming year, I will make sure that we deliver.

The interim report also outlines additional areas of work being undertaken to ensure military personnel are not disadvantaged by their service to their country.

This interim report is additional to the legal requirement placed on the Defence Secretary to deliver an annual Armed Forces Covenant Report. This statutory requirement, which was enshrined in law by the Armed Forces Act, will come into effect next year.

Since May 2010, the Government has fulfilled a number of pledges made to repair the Military Covenant, including:

• the doubling of the tax free Operational Allowance

• improving Rest and Recuperation leave for those on operations

• endorsing the proposals for improving mental health care and provision of prosthetics

• the delivery of a scheme to provide scholarships to bereaved Service children

• the delivery of more help for those leaving the Services to go on to higher/further education

• the introduction of the Pupil Premium for the children of those currently serving currently £200 per child, rising to £250 in 2012-13.) in addition, we have provided further funding of £3M per year for state schools with Service children (including those of reservists), to help offset the impact of deployed service

• the announcement of a Community Covenant scheme supported by a £30m Community Covenant fund - nearly £1m of funding was released after the first batch of bids were received in September

• the doubling of Council Tax Relief for those on eligible operations overseas

• working with Credit Reference Agencies to ensure Service people are not disadvantaged by mobility requirements in accessing credit.

The full Armed Forces Covenant report will consider the delivery of services to our Armed Forces in the areas of housing, education and healthcare and the operation of inquests, as well as other areas that the Secretary of State judges to be appropriate.

The Department is also required to consider where Service personnel may be disadvantaged in accessing public and commercial products and where special treatment may be justified and set out his response to these issues.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said:

The cross-government ministerial committee will give a voice to, and act as champion of, Armed Forces and veterans’ issues to ensure Government is joined up when providing vital services for Armed Forces personnel. Its implementation shows the Government listens to those who work tirelessly on behalf of the men and women of our Armed Forces, their families and veterans.

The interim report shows the hard work the Government has put into delivering its promises to troops both at home and those deployed on operations. However the work will not stop there, as even more effort is being put into delivering support for our Service personnel to ensure they are not disadvantaged in any way by their military service.

It reaffirms both countries’ commitment to peace, democracy and respect for human rights, and sets out our agreement to continue to co-operate on political dialogue, security, governance, development and cultural links.

The signing of the partnership on Saturday 28 January 2012 builds on the International Afghanistan Conference in Bonn last year where the international community sent a strong message of commitment to Afghanistan’s long-term future.

It shows that the UK will have a wide-ranging relationship with Afghanistan which will continue beyond the transition of security control to Afghan forces and the drawdown of international combat troops by the end of 2014.

Speaking from Chequers at the weekend, the Prime Minister said:

The build-up of the Afghan National Army and Afghan Police Force is very much on target and that is going to be one of the keys to the future stability and security of Afghanistan. We also want to have a long-term relationship with Afghanistan long after our combat troops have come home and that will happen at the end of 2014.

We will have a long-term relationship that will be based on the friendship of two sovereign nations. That will be a relationship about diplomacy, about aid, about trade, about investment, and about very strong two-way diplomatic ties and conversations like we’ve been having today [Saturday].

President Karzai thanked the Prime Minister and the people of Britain for their help in creating a better, more secure Afghanistan. He said:

The signature today [Saturday] of the agreement between us towards a long-term relationship will take us into a future where Afghanistan will benefit from the assistance and co-operation and help of Britain towards becoming a fundamentally strong democratic state free of terrorism and economically better off.

The UK strongly supports the Afghan Government’s efforts to achieve a more inclusive political process and take forward reconciliation with those who are willing to renounce violence, break with Al-Qaeda and respect the Afghan constitution. At their meeting on Saturday, the two leaders also discussed further reforms necessary, particularly on the political track, to enable long-term stability in Afghanistan.

The Prime Minister said:

I think part of achieving that is not just what we are doing on the ground in Afghanistan with all the NATO partners, not just the long-term discussions that we’ve been having but also the need - as the President and I have often spoken about - for a political process that ensures that all Afghans, if they give up violence, if they give up terror, can play a part in a strong Afghan democratic constitutional state for the future.

Mr Cameron reiterated that the pace of the transition of security responsibility from the international coalition to Afghan security forces will depend on the situation on the ground. He said:

…between now and 2014 there will be opportunities for different countries to reduce their numbers. Britain has herself reduced our troop numbers over the last year. I don’t want to see some sort of cliff edge in 2014 when all the remaining troops come out at once but clearly between now and 2014 the rate at which we can reduce our troops will depend on the transition to Afghan control in the different parts of Afghanistan.

And that should be the same for all of the members of NATO who are all contributing and helping towards a strong, stable, peaceful Afghanistan which is in all our interests.","Reorganisation of the MOD into three pillars (Strategy and Policy, Armed Forces, Procurement and Estates)",Institutional,,id25_970

Three London-based Reservists - Able Seaman Richie Wilkinson, Lance Corporal Mark Herbage and Flight Lieutenant James Morris - also jumped on Boris Bikes earlier in the week to undertake their daily commute through the city and promote the event.

Uniform to Work Day has been organised as part of the build up to Armed Forces Day on Saturday, 25 June 2011, which celebrates all of those who make up the Armed Forces Family. It also provides an opportunity to celebrate the role of the Reserves and to show the public the Armed Forces are made up of people from all sections of the community.

Reservists provide valuable support to the Regular Armed Forces and are deployed on operations, including Opertaion HERRICK (Afghanistan) and Operation ELLAMY (Libya).

To demonstrate their commitment, both the Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Peter Wall, and the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, joined Reservists on their way to work.

Gen Wall and Territorial Army (TA) soldiers, Lance Corporal Phil Vergottini, Lieutenant David McConkey and Ranger Michael Noonan, all took the Tube to the Ministry of Defence offices, while Admiral Stanhope took a river taxi to work accompanied by AB Wilkinson, from the Royal Naval Reservists, and Lieutenant Ollie Clark, from the Royal Navy.

LCpl Vergottini is a tube driver on the Northern Line and last year he left civvy street for a six-month tour of Afghanistan, where he was part of the Counter-IED (Improvised Explosive Device) Task Force, providing infantry support for the specialist C-IED operators.

LCpl Vergottini said:

I’m proud of being part of the TA and all that I’ve achieved there, and today is an opportunity for me to show the public that, behind my usual work clothes, I also serve my country. I completed a tour of Afghanistan last year, but most of the time I look like any other civilian.

The support we get from the public and our employers on Uniform to Work Day is a huge boost to morale for me and my fellow TA soldiers.

Meeting them today, Gen Wall said:

I am very pleased to have this opportunity to show my support for our TA soldiers by meeting LCpl Vergottini at his place of work, and enjoy a ride in his driver’s cab. The value and ethos of the Army can only enhance our TA soldiers’ performance in their peacetime roles. I am delighted to witness this first hand.

Admiral Stanhope agreed with these sentiments and added:

Many of our Reserve Sailors and Royal Marines will, today, wear their uniform to work; either with their civilian employer or as part of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines deployed on operations where they are contributing to regional stability in Afghanistan, conducting counter-piracy operations in the Indian Ocean, and supporting the UN Arms embargo and No-Fly Zone off Libya.

Whether Regular or Reserve, Veteran or Cadet, we remember with huge pride and gratitude their service for their nation.

Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton, said:

The Royal Air Force, as well as embedded Royal Auxiliary Air Force colleagues and a number of sponsored reserves, is deployed on operations around the world. Together they are delivering critical elements of this country’s operational capability both in the air and on the ground.

This integrated ‘whole force air component concept’ allows our people, who are the bedrock of our capability, to work, fight and fly as a seamless air power team. On Uniform to Work day I join colleagues, friends, families and employers in paying particular tribute to our Reservist personnel for their tremendous commitment and service.

There are around 38,000 people across the UK who give up their time to be part of the Armed Forces Reserves.

Sermons were delivered by Imam Asim, the Muslim Chaplain to the British Armed Forces, and also by the Imam of the local 205 Corps of the Afghan National Army (ANA), demonstrating the united relationship between ISAF and the ANA.

The sight of ISAF troops and the local community joining together to celebrate their faith offered some respite for the whole camp from the difficulties being faced in Afghanistan.

Eid ul Adha is one of two highly important Muslim festivals in the Islamic calendar. Imam Asim drew his sermon from Abraham’s teachings on loyalty and commitment to duties. The Imam asked those present to concentrate on these principles and draw strength from the teachings.

Imam Asim said:

This service provided an opportunity for ISAF to demonstrate respect for the Muslim faith by providing a service for all Muslims on the base. One young American pilot told me of the sense of unity he felt being able to pray with fellow Muslim soldiers from other countries and with local Afghans, in a celebration that counters the insurgent messages that ISAF are at war with Islam.

Being in theatre is obviously a demanding and taxing time for anyone who is deployed. A visit from a chaplain of your own faith, particularly on a demanding operational tour, can help with boosting the spirits of individuals.

The opportunity to pray and reflect on key issues while on operations can really help people put their lives, tasks and situations into perspective. The Eid service really brought home to me the commitment with which the British and coalition forces serve.

Imam Asim was appointed five years ago as the Muslim Chaplain to the British Armed Forces:

Joining the MOD as a chaplain I had little idea that within a few years I would be leading two Eid prayers at NATO’s largest military base on active operations in southern Afghanistan,” he said.

These events are minor miracles whilst at once being typical examples of the harmony in which Muslims and others live side-by-side in the UK and in the West generally.

This is the second Eid service Imam Asim has led in Kandahar this year, having conducted a service in September during a six-week trip.

Dr…",Ministry of Defence and The Rt Hon Liam Fox,14 June 2010,"Dr Fox began by saying that the SDSR would be led by the requirement to deliver and support the sort of foreign policy the country needs.

Dr Fox said:

It will be strategic, cross-government and comprehensive, covering all areas of defence and security.

We will make sure that the capabilities we invest in are those best placed to provide the security we need for the future.

We will bring defence policy, plans, commitments and resources into balance, and produce over time a transformative change to British Defence.

Dr Fox said the SDSR would be carried out against the background of a ‘dangerous and unpredictable’ security environment and a dire financial situation, worse than had been anticipated when he was in opposition:

I want to make sure that there are no illusions about the daunting scale of the challenge we face,” he said.

The Defence Secretary then reminded his audience that the first duty of Government is to protect our way of life and provide security for its citizens.

He said:

While many arms of Government are directed towards or contribute to this aim, it is the Armed Forces that are central to this effort. Of course there are many things our Armed Forces can do in the promotion of our national interest and to support Government policy more widely.

Our Service personnel are highly committed and extremely capable with a ‘can-do’ attitude, and with the equipment, logistics and know-how to deal with a wide range of situations.

We know that we can rely on them to fulfil whatever task is thrust upon them. That might be resilience operations here in the UK, such as helping in the aftermath of flooding; or where there is a need for military capability to assist an urgent life-saving humanitarian crisis abroad.

But we must not lose sight of their primary mission - to maintain the capability to apply lethal force where needed so that political decision-makers have the widest possible range of choices when making strategic decisions.

Dr Fox said that this primary mission had two aspects. The first of which was for the Armed Forces to protect our citizens and territory by deterring and containing threats, ‘preventing possibilities from becoming actualities’:

We underestimate the value of deterrence at our peril and we do ourselves a disservice if we merely confine it to the concept of nuclear weapons.

“The nuclear deterrent is of course fundamental to our ability to deter the most destructive forms of aggression. But we must also remember the powerful deterrent effect of our conventional forces. Recently we have perhaps failed fully to recognise this.
> 
> I want the SDSR to change that, to take a fresh look at what we are doing to dissuade aggression, and how we might do this better.

The second core mission for Defence, said Dr Fox, is for it to also be there for when everything goes wrong, ‘when deterrence and containment have failed, when diplomacy is exhausted, and, as a last resort, the use of lethal force is required’:

No other arm of Government can deliver this or is designed for this purpose and it cannot be outsourced or delegated, even to our friends.

So our Armed Forces must be structured first to deter and second to deliver the use of force in support of our national interest and to protect national security.

Dr Fox said this primary mission was currently being played out in Afghanistan and that British forces were in the country ‘out of necessity, not choice’:

Our mission in Afghanistan is vital for our national security, vital for the security of the region and vital for global stability. We cannot allow Afghanistan to be used again as a haven for terrorists or a launch-pad for attacks on the UK or our allies.

So Afghanistan remains our top priority, and our people in theatre will get the best support that is possible.

Counter-insurgency needs strategic patience, and we’re committed to seeing the mission through to resolution - creating a stable enough Afghanistan to allow the Afghan people to manage their own internal and external security.

This is no time for us to lose our nerve and we must find the language to persuade the British people to stick with us.

He said he expected significant progress by the end of the year, consolidating ISAF’s hold in central Helmand and accelerating the training of the Afghan National Security Forces.

He added:

There is absolutely no reason why any NATO country cannot do more for the training mission - it is a measure of our commitment and resolve as an alliance; and it is the route to bringing our troops home without leaving a security vacuum behind.

Acknowledging that conducting a Defence and Security Review while the country is engaged in war is not ideal, Dr Fox said that after 12 years a review was something the country could not afford to delay:

Change is not an option, it is a necessity,” Dr Fox said. “Even if defence spending kept pace with inflation, we face a deficit of many billions of pounds over the life of this Parliament and more over the next decade.

Dr Fox said that reductions in administration costs and increases in efficiency would not be enough on their own:

The problem is structural so the response must be structural to put Defence on a stable footing. The MOD itself must face reform.

We intend to reorganise the whole organisation into three pillars - first Strategy and Policy, second Armed Forces, and third Procurement and Estates.

We intend to create a more efficient and leaner centre where everyone knows what they are responsible for and who they are accountable to - with the deadlines and budgetary disciplines taken for granted elsewhere.

Major reform of our procurement practices will be accompanied by a number of industrial consultations that I will outline shortly to Parliament.

But as much as structural reform is required, I am equally determined that the Armed Forces are reconfigured to meet the needs of the evolving security environment and satisfy the ambitions this country has.

We do have to operate in the financial climate we have inherited and Defence cannot be immune from that challenge. We will have to be tough and unsentimental to boot if we are to do what needs to be done. But while the SDSR may be resource-informed, it is policy-led.

On the strategic environment facing Defence Dr Fox said that the new Government’s foreign policy would pursue the defence of UK interests with the recognition that our prosperity and security is bound up with those of others:

This will require the enhancement of diplomatic relations with key partners, using Britain’s unique network of friendships, bonds and alliances, working bilaterally as well as multilaterally,” Dr Fox said.

We will need to be smarter about when and how we deploy power, which tasks we can do in alliance with others, and what capabilities we will need as a result.

In the final analysis we will need to retain the capacity to deploy military strength in defence of our own national interests.

Dr Fox listed several of the possible security challenges the country could face over the coming decades. These included:

Dr Fox said:

That is the reality of the world in which we live and we must break away from the recent habit of planning for the best case scenario and then hoping the worst never happens.

Unlike the Cold War, we cannot be confident about how, and how quickly, these trends might evolve.

I shall therefore be conducting a thorough stock-take of our contingency plans in the months ahead.

The Defence Secretary said that responding to such events would not be for Britain alone and that Britain’s relationship with the United States will remain critical for our security.

He also said NATO will remain our first instrument of choice for responding to the collective security challenges we face and increased co-operation with other nations would be required, and therefore he intends to treat, and consequently fund, a defence diplomacy programme separately within the SDSR.

Concluding, Dr Fox said that the SDSR will be a major reform agenda, ‘informed by the pressure on resources but driven by the changing world in which we live and the nature of the threats we face’.

He said:

Let me reassure you that the SDSR will be strategic, cross-government, and a comprehensive exercise overseen by the newly-formed National Security Council, to provide a coherent approach to security, and informed by a new National Security Strategy.

He said that there are competing priorities, risks to manage and budgets to balance but ‘we must act ruthlessly and without sentiment’:

It is inevitable that there will be the perception of winners and losers as we go through this process. But Defence as a whole must come out in a stronger position.

Dr Fox said that the conclusions of the review would be published in a white paper by the end of the year.

The CHF have been operating their Sea King HC4 helicopters in support of Operation HERRICK since late 2007.

Today, the aircraft can now be armed with either the 7.62mm general purpose machine gun or the M3M, the latter only having recently been fully cleared for operational duties with the CHF.

This now provides the Sea King HC4 with a defensive and offensive capability, helping to increase their operational versatility and allowing the CHF to undertake a wider range of support missions.

Lieutenant Commander Nigel Gates, Aviation Warfare Officer at CHF Command, explained the benefits of the new weapon:

The M3M is able to put down a higher rate of fire than the general purpose machine gun [GPMG], and, being .50-calibre instead of 7.62 [mm], each round obviously has greater effect.

The rounds have much greater energy so not only do they travel further but their flight path is affected much less by gravity; this means the gunner can lay down rounds accurately from a safe range or altitude.

The Sea King is a good stable platform for the weapon and we are confident this will give us significant extra capability in support of ground units.

The M3M is fitted into the Sea King using a specially adapted base plate which allows the weapon to be stowed and the cabin door to be closed when not in use. A specially mounted canister holding 600 rounds is attached to the side of the cabin just aft of the main door.

The CHF have their own Royal Marine Air Door Gunner Instructors on both the GPMG and M3M.

Aircrew undertake ground instruction followed by day and night shoots to become qualified on both weapon systems. These shoots cover a range of operational profiles depending on the mission. Aircrew learn to operate both the M3M and GPMG using night-vision goggles.

The M3M is in use with a number of other air arms including the Royal Navy Lynx HMA8 and the Army Air Corps AgustaWestland Lynx Mk9A, which have recently been deployed to Afghanistan.",Troops to Teachers programme,Welfare,,id25_975

A residual threat remains from mines and other unexploded ordnance left behind as a legacy of the former Gaddafi regime.

In the course of this work, HMS Bangor’s advanced sonar successfully detected both the heavily-corroded 2,000-pound mine and the torpedo. Bangor was able to safely destroy both of the weapons using demolition charges dropped in place by her Seafox remotely-controlled underwater submersible, working at a depth of 475 feet (145m) in the case of the mine.

Bangor’s Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Commander Neil Marriott, said:

To find two pieces of ordnance and destroy them safely is a great result for my ship’s company.

We have been hunting for mines since June, working from port to port, and a success like this means shipping into Libya is that much safer.

Both weapons were spotted by a mine warfare team working in Bangor’s operations room as they kept a close eye on the data fed to them by the Sandown Class ship’s cutting-edge sonar sensors.

Ops room supervisor, Petty Officer Steve ‘Stirling’ Moss, said:

When we’re minehunting we have several people watching the screens for any contact.

On this task we saw several items which looked about the size of a mine, and two of them turned out to be real. It’s not a regular thing to happen, so we’re really pleased we found them and we were able to destroy them.

Bangor’s new mission in eastern Libya comes after spending recent months off Misurata helping to keep the sea lanes to the then besieged port open earlier in the civil war.

Bangor’s 38-strong crew have been part of Operation UNIFIED PROTECTOR since taking over from the minehunter HMS Brocklesby, which blew up a mine near Misurata as the war with Colonel Gaddafi raged.

Lieutenant Commander Marriott added:

We were due to go and work in the North Sea and Baltic when we deployed, but this task took priority and we were ready to do it. We have hunted for mines off Benghazi and Brega already, and are ready to search in any other Libyan port that needs it.

With both of these explosives, they were historic, and their detonation methods had corroded, but they could still have been set off accidentally so it was the right thing to do to destroy them.

Bangor moved away from the Libyan coastline with a Dutch minehunter and Canadian frigate on Sunday, but is ready to return there if needed.

The Sandown Class ship is one of two Royal Navy vessels committed to the ongoing NATO mission off Libya; the other, the destroyer HMS Liverpool, continues to patrol the Gulf of Sirte enforcing UN resolutions.

Supply ship RFA Fort Rosalie has been ordered home as she’s no longer required, and HMS Ocean has been dispatched east of Suez now her Apache gunships are no longer needed to conduct strike missions against targets ashore.

Meanwhile, the RAF has continued to participate in NATO’s intensive armed patrols over Sirte. On Sunday afternoon, RAF aircraft identified one of Colonel Gaddafi’s multiple rocket launchers, scoring a direct hit on it with a Brimstone missile.

On Saturday, allied reconnaissance operations identified a supply base for some of Colonel Gaddafi’s anti-aircraft artillery weapons in Sirte.

A formation of RAF Tornado GR4s was tasked with the destruction of the position and four Paveway precision guided bombs were successfully dropped on the target.

Later on Saturday, another formation of GR4s, conducting an armed reconnaissance patrol over Sirte, sighted an armed pick-up truck being used by former regime forces, and destroyed it with a direct hit from a Brimstone missile.",Reintegration of wounded servicemen and women,Institutional,Other,id25_976

The annual event is a lucrative fundraiser for the military charity that helps and supports those serving in the Armed Forces and their families.

The MOD’s Main Building Big Brew Up event in London took place this morning and Armed Forces Minister Nick Harvey dropped in to lend his support. He said:

The Government takes very seriously our duty of care to Armed Forces personnel throughout their career and, indeed, afterwards. But that duty of care goes beyond government. It’s a duty of care that the whole of society owes to the Armed Forces as well.

The Armed Forces increasingly in recent years have enjoyed people’s support and respect not only because of the difficult and dangerous job they do but also for who they are and the values they represent.

It is through generous support to organisations likeSSAFAand events like The Big Brew Up that people can show how grateful they are for the selfless commitment shown by our Armed Forces.

SSAFAofficials said they hoped to exceed the previous year’s fundraising total of around £800.

Serving at the Main Building event,SSAFAtea lady Laurena Dibello said:

Every year we get tremendous support and everyone comes down and enjoys a cup of tea forSSAFA, donating whatever spare change they have - every penny counts.

Ahead of the event,SSAFAsaid the aim was to bring colleagues together for an old-fashioned cuppa. In Main Building, hundreds of staff broke away from their desks for a few moments, keen to do their bit for charity. One of them, Major Oliver Dobson, said:

I think it’s a very worthwhile cause and I’ve just popped down for a coffee. All my office are coming down at one stage.

Over two hours, staff served up hundreds of cups of tea and coffee and cake generously donated by caterers ESS. They soldSSAFAmerchandise alongside books, with all proceeds going to the charity.

Paul Branscombe, Deputy Controller ofSSAFA, accompanied by his successor, Julie Quinn, said:

We hope to raise as much money as we possibly can, but MOD folk are always surprisingly generous.

There was no shortage of thirsty patrons, including colleagues Marion Horne and Jenny Dowling from Defence Civilian Personnel who were eager to sample the tea and cakes. Marion said:

This [event] is why we work for the MOD to support our lads and their families.

Next to visit the tea table were Adam Forgiel-Jenkins, Alan Nisbet and Wing Commander Jez Milne. Adam, who works for Minister Gerald Howarth, said:

I work for Gerald Howarth who is very supportive ofSSAFA. It’s a good opportunity to come down and holding the event here makes it accessible for everyone.

It’s a good, fun way to support a charity who do a lot to support our guys who are away.

Armed Forces Minister Mr Harvey expressed his appreciation for the vital work carried out bySSAFAon behalf of troops, families and veterans that ranges from the practical to the emotional.

Now in its 14th year, The Big Brew Up raised £100,000 last year. Mr Harvey said:

It draws heavily on evidence learned from the world’s best education systems, and will see heads and teachers driving school improvement, the Education Department announced.

Find out more about the Troops to Teachers scheme.

Part of the plan relates to Armed Forces leavers. The white paper states:

We will encourage Armed Forces leavers to become teachers by developing a ‘Troops to Teachers’ programme which will sponsor Service leavers to train as teachers.

We will pay tuition fees for PGCEs [postgraduate certificates in education] for eligible graduates leaving the Armed Forces and work with universities to explore the possibility of establishing a bespoke compressed undergraduate route into teaching targeted at Armed Forces leavers who have the relevant experience and skills but may lack degree-level qualifications.

We will encourage Teach First to work with the Services as they develop Teach Next, so that Service leavers are able to take advantage of new opportunities to move into education.

Service leavers also have a great deal to offer young people as mentors and we will be looking to increase opportunities for this.

The charity Skill Force does fantastic work in this area enabling more former Armed Forces personnel to work alongside the children who benefit most from their support.

Skill Force is a charity that delivers programmes to increase the numbers of young people entering education, employment and training on leaving school. Their courses, which help young people earn vocational qualifications and develop life skills, are taught mainly by ex-Armed Forces personnel who have been wounded or are on long-term sick leave. The Service personnel develop a close working relationship with their students and help to instil a culture of respect and mutual support.

Speaking about the plans for a ‘Troops to Teachers’ programme in the Schools white paper 2010, Education Secretary Michael Gove said:

I can’t think of anything better than getting people who know all about self-discipline, teamwork and a sense of pride into our schools to complement the huge numbers of great teachers we have there.

The Schools white paper 2010 outlines the coalition government’s plans. Further details on implementation of the proposals should be announced in due course.",Extra 30 minutes of free talk time and reduced call rates to UK landlines.,Welfare,Other,id25_978
979,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/injured-soldiers-chosen-for-north-pole-expedition,News story,Injured soldiers chosen for North Pole expedition,"Four soldiers, severely injured during operations in Afghanistan, have been chosen as the 'Walking With The Wounded' team that will journey, unaided, to the geographical North Pole in April this year.",Ministry of Defence,13 January 2011,"The full Walking With The Wounded team was unveiled at an event in London’s Trafalgar Square yesterday.

From 100 applicants, 30 were shortlisted, eight chosen for Arctic training, and four finally chosen to undertake the expedition. They will be joined by two expedition leaders and a Norwegian polar guide.

The four chosen to undertake the expedition are:

•Cavalry officer Captain Guy Disney- lost his lower leg during Operation PANTHER’S CLAW in Afghanistan in 2009 when his Spartan armoured vehicle came under heavy fire in an ambush and a rocket-propelled grenade pierced the hull. Private Robbie Laws from The Mercian Regiment was killed in the same incident.

•Paratrooper Captain Martin Hewitt- lost the use of his right arm after being shot during a gun battle with the enemy in Afghanistan in 2007.

•Sergeant Steve Young of the Welsh Guards- was caught in an IED blast whilst travelling in a Mastiff armoured personnel carrier during Operation PANTHER’S CLAW in Afghanistan in 2009. He sustained a fractured vertebra, among other injuries, and was warned he might not walk again.

•Paratrooper Private Jaco van Gass- had his left arm amputated at the elbow in 2009 following a rocket-propelled grenade attack in Afghanistan.

Private Jaco van Gass pulls his sledge across the snow during Arctic training [Picture: Copyright Walking With The Wounded 2011]

The aim of the expedition is to successfully reach the North Pole with four wounded soldiers, of which two are amputees. They will become the first amputees to reach the North Pole unsupported.

Private van Gass said:

It’s not about me. The main focus is for other wounded soldiers - to show them we have to carry on.

Each member of the expedition team will haul heavy sledges weighing in excess of 100kg, but will be allowed to take one luxury item weighing no more than two kilos.

En route to the Pole the team will constantly be walking on moving ice with temperatures ranging from minus 15 to minus 50 degrees C. Their challenge will be compounded by constantly high moisture levels, making hypothermia and frostbite a constant threat. The team will also be faced with perpetual sunlight.

As well as battling against high winds, blizzards and plunging sub-zero temperatures, they will also have to cope with compacted ridges of ice, some near vertical.

They will also have to navigate a dreaded phenomenon called ‘leads’, stretches of icy sea water that can open up gaps between the ice and which can only be traversed by floating across.

As the ice is constantly shifting, they face the possible nightmare scenario of skiing several miles northwards to the pole, only to drift backwards and end up even further away.

In the early days of the trek, the team may also have to contend with carnivorous polar bears near the coast, although attacks are rare and precautions will be taken.

Captain Hewitt said:

When I was told about Walking With The Wounded I instantly wanted to get involved. I then told a few friends, colleagues and other disabled people about the plan, and whilst some were positive about the challenge, others said it couldn’t be done.

Some would say that there’s a good reason why no disabled person has ever walked to the North Pole unsupported. I don’t like being told something can’t be done! I instantly thought that’s it, the challenge is on. Utrinque Paratus [Latin motto of The Parachute Regiment meaning ‘Ready for Anything’]!

Sergeant Young added:

This challenge is a huge goal to achieve and hopefully it will inspire other battle-wounded soldiers to push themselves and never give up.

And Captain Disney said:

A phenomenal opportunity and a great chance to show what is achievable. It would be hard to say no if I had both legs, now I have one it is a must.

The team plans to set off at the end of March for the Pole from Siberia and hopes, over 25 days, to cover a distance of 12 nautical miles (22km) a day.

Prince Harry, who has expressed a serious desire to take part in the expedition, is also the charity’s patron. He said:

I am so proud to be patron of Walking With The Wounded.

This extraordinary expedition will raise awareness of the debt this country owes to those it sends off to fight - only for them to return wounded and scarred, physically and emotionally.

The debt extends beyond immediate medical care and short-term rehabilitation. These men and women have given so much. We must recognise their sacrifice, be thankful, and, so far as we can ever, repay them for it.

This polar adventure will exemplify the tenacity and remarkable courage of those who serve in uniform. The vision behind Walking With The Wounded - to reintegrate wounded servicemen and women successfully back into civilian life - recognises the unquenchable spirit and drive of these young people.

It aims to harness their determination and energy, whilst adjusting their mindset to face the numerous challenges that lie ahead.

Walking With The Wounded promises to be remarkable. I salute the team walking to the North Pole in early 2011 and I urge everyone to support them.

980,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/army-chaplain-speaks-of-life-on-the-front-line,News story,Army chaplain speaks of life on the front line,Army chaplain Stephen Hancock describes how life for a padre on operations can be tough but very rewarding.,Ministry of Defence,29 September 2011,"From carrying a 35-kilo Bergen in sweltering temperatures in Afghanistan to baptising an infant in a UK village church, Padre Hancock has done it all.

Dressed in green like the regular soldiers, military padres blend in with the crowd, but it is being able to develop a particular ‘visibility’ that Padre Hancock believes is the secret to success:

I really believe in visibility, that a chaplain should be seen walking around talking to anybody and everybody,” he said. “By doing that you build relationships and soldiers and officers will trust you. If you’re invisible you have no chance of achieving a great deal with them.

Armed with a bible and a cross, life for a padre on operations can be tough. They go out on patrols and live in forward operating bases, on hand for when they might be needed.

Despite the harshness and the challenges, nothing is more rewarding said Padre Hancock:

Sitting in a vehicle watching these guys, in body armour and helmet in 56 degrees [Celsius] heat, 122 [degrees Fahrenheit] in English money, you’ve got to be robust, but that’s how you earn their respect.

Even if you fainted, they’d probably love you more - you’ve just got to join in.

You’ve got to do what they’re doing, be with them, share with them, and then it’s incredible how, when you least expect it, they will come to you with their intimate pain and intimate secret.

And that is a real privileged position and you start to think ‘my presence is not wasted’.

Currently based with the Army Air Corps in Hampshire, Padre Hancock has served as a chaplain in every arm of the British Army.

His job is to provide spiritual, moral and pastoral support to all soldiers and their families irrespective of religion and belief.

He joined the military as a soldier in 1989 and worked as a policeman before he had his ‘calling’ from God. He was serving in Berlin, just as the wall was coming down, when he took the decision:

An Army chaplain asked if God was calling me. I was very active in the church as a Christian, I’d led worship from the piano and sung a few things and I’d preached at an English church in Berlin.

I didn’t realise it at the time but three or four ministers were testing me and they told me to go for the ordained ministry.

Posted to Northern Ireland during the troubles, he left the Army in 1994 and began a local preacher’s course for the Methodist Church.

He went to Queen’s University in Belfast and took a degree in theology, graduating three years later, and was then sent to serve in a Methodist Church in the Republic of Ireland.

Four years after being ordained, and married with three children, he joined the Army for the second time.

Despite the training, deploying for the first time was a bit of a shock to the system:

When I went to Iraq it really was seat-of-the-pants stuff. As a friend says about parenthood, ‘give me a break, I’m making this up as I go along’. There’s no manual.

I was chaplain in the medical aid post and casualties and fatalities were coming in from both sides and I was able to do some incredible things. I was asked to pray for a dead Iraqi boy by his father.

The Army chaplain’s office had prepared prayers for us and his dad asked me to help carry his son home. I managed to get a Warrior and we drove into part of Basra and delivered this boy to his family and then we got out of there quick. That will live with me.

When I went back out there with the Royal Dragoon Guards, 18 months later on TELIC 5, I knew what to expect, but Iraq had changed and I was pretty much confined to camp for six months - the threat had gone through the roof.

You do share the pain of the loss. You cannot be insensitive to it.

With two tours of Iraq and a tour of Afghanistan behind him, Padre Hancock has experienced life-changing moments and he said he is better at spotting ‘problems in a person’s face’.

Despite the huge variety, he believes his role in the Army is no different to being a civilian clergyman - the essentials are the same.

As for his next exciting adventure, he said:

In addition, from this month onwards, troops will be able to purchase extra calls from Afghanistan to a UK landline at a reduced rate of 6.5 pence per minute, down from 11 pence.

Troops are routinely given an allowance of 30 minutes each week by the MOD, which is doubled in time for Christmas Day, and are also able to buy extra minutes - now at a reduced cost - should they wish.

Secretary of State for Defence, Dr Liam Fox, said:

Fighting on the front line is always tough, but it can be especially testing for troops and their families during the festive period. Cutting the cost of calls home and increasing the amount of free talk time during this time will hopefully go some way to showing our appreciation for their ongoing efforts.

Ranger Ian McKergan, who is currently serving in the Nad ‘Ali area of Helmand province with 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment, said:

Usually all my phone minutes are taken up speaking to my parents and girlfriend and so the extra minutes I am getting over Christmas and the New Year and the cheaper rates are a really great idea. It means that I will also be able to touch base with all my extended family and friends and makes being away over this period that little bit easier.

The reduced rate in the cost of calls to UK landlines has been agreed with communications company Paradigm under the current Welfare Communications Everywhere (WelComE) services at no extra cost to the MOD, and the cost of calls is expected to stay at this level for the foreseeable future.

Colonel Neil Fraser, who is responsible for the WelComE service for Defence Equipment and Support, added:

Having had three Christmas Days deployed on operations, two of these in Afghanistan, I know how difficult it can be for families to be apart during this time. Hopefully these cheaper calls, as well as the extra free talk time minutes, will mean that troops and their families will be able to speak for longer and more frequently when it matters the most.

In addition to their weekly allowance of free talk time, troops on operations are also entitled to unlimited internet access and, in certain locations, a newly-installed Wi-Fi service is now available, giving personnel access to their emails from the privacy of their accommodation.",Ceremony of the Constable’s Dues,Other,,id25_981

Several shots across the bow from the Portsmouth-based destroyer’s 4.5-inch (11.5cm) gun sent the boats scurrying for the relative safety of harbour.

Land and naval forces loyal to Colonel Gaddafi have made repeated attempts to take Misurata and block the port, including laying mines.

In this sortie, three rigid inflatable boats and one small craft were spotted leaving Zlitan harbour - which is in Government hands - by NATO forces patrolling in the area.

Liverpool was sent in to investigate and tracked the boats using her array of sensors. She identified that personnel were being transferred between the four craft.

If left unchecked, these craft could have posed a possible threat to the civilian population, so the destroyer went to action stations and closed in on the four boats, warning them to return to port.

After half-an-hour of such warnings with no response, Liverpool’s 4.5-inch gun fired a warning shot across their bows. A high explosive shell roared from the ship and was seen to land to the east of the contacts.

One rigid inflatable boat took the hint and returned to port, but the three remaining craft refused to budge - initially. A salvo of three more warning shots crashed into the water near the boats, whose crew got the message and went back to Zlitan:

Through the reading of warnings, we were able to give pro-Gaddafi forces the opportunity to return to their base port,” said Liverpool’s Commanding Officer, Commander Colin Williams.

It shows that they can be kept at bay by a responsible show of force, without unnecessary violence.

My ship’s company once again showed their professional attitude, responding admirably to another challenge laid before them.

It’s the second time the four-and-a-half inch gun has been fired in anger by Liverpool. Last month she was fired on with rockets in the same area and again returned fire with her gun - which has a range of more than 12 nautical miles (22km).

Her key role in Operation UNIFIED PROTECTOR, as a member of the NATO Task Group, is in support of UN Security Council Resolutions 1973 and 1970, enforcing embargo operations along the Libyan coast.

The K3 variant flown by 101 Squadron can carry 80 tonnes of fuel and dispense it to a wide range of aircraft from the UK and many other nations taking part in NATO’s Operation UNIFIED PROTECTOR.

The VC10’s four Rolls-Royce Conway engines quickly bring her to take-off speed as she climbs out over the Mediterranean from her current base at Sicily’s Trapani Birgi airport to her first designated refuelling location.

It may be convenient to think of the VC10 as an airborne filling station, but that does everyone involved a disservice.

The fuel load she carries has been carefully calculated in a planning process that begins at NATO’s air headquarters at Poggio Renatico in northern Italy a few days before, and continues until just before take-off.

The flight deck of a 101 Squadron VC10 K3 during a refuelling mission [Picture: Senior Aircraftwoman Sally Raimondo, Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]

Once in the air, that plan can be adjusted to meet the demands of a changing situation. Under the control of a coalition E-3 AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) aircraft, often a UK E-3D, the VC10 can move from one refuelling area to another.

No roadside petrol station will come to you, but the VC10 can meet you at a convenient location to support your task.

And the people who fly it love it. One pilot says:

It’s a great aircraft. It really is the Queen of the Skies. It’s one of the last pilot aircraft - you have to have your hands on to fly it. And it still does the job.

On a recent flight, somewhere off the coast of Libya, the first pair of aircraft are expected. The VC10 flight engineer trails a hose from each of the two under-wing pods, ready to provide fuel.

Two Canadian F-18s pull alongside just off one wing. Once they are cleared to refuel, one drops back and comes round the rear of the VC10 to sit behind the other wing. Each aircraft then manoeuvres carefully to plug a refuelling probe into the drogue at the end of the refuelling hose. They then push forward a few feet to start the fuel flowing.

After a few minutes they have enough fuel. They drop off the hoses, reform as a pair on the other wingtip and then break away, disappearing into the distance.

The key role of the VC10 in supporting the NATO coalition is shown by the aircraft served in this mission. After the Canadians, two Italian Harrier aircraft refuel. Then it is the turn of two Spanish F-18s. While RAF fast jets are flying at the same time, their tasking means that they refuel from another nation’s tanker elsewhere.

The utility of the VC10, after long years of service, training with various NATO partners, is that so many different nations’ aircraft can work with her. The fuel she dispenses means those aircraft can spend longer on task, protecting Libyan civilians.

The two VC10s based at Trapani (a third is at RAF Akrotiri on Cyprus) fly up to three missions a day. One aircraft will fly, return, refuel, and fly again later the same day.

The VC10s at Trapani are commanded by Squadron Leader Tim Kemp, who said:

Tanker support is crucial for the fast jets to spend any meaningful time over Libya.

I am proud of what people are achieving here. When we deployed here, there was nothing. We were flying operations within 36 hours of arriving.

As the sun sets, the VC10 returns to Trapani. She has dispensed around 20 tonnes of fuel. Ground crew marshal her back to her parking spot, before ensuring she is serviced, refuelled and ready for tomorrow’s task.

Squadron Leader Kemp concludes:

The fleet is working very hard. We have two aircraft here, one in Akrotiri, two for Operation HERRICK [Afghanistan], one in the Falklands, and one for standby tasking in the UK, as well as continuing to undertake UK-based training and other operational tasking.

We are working very hard but the engineers are pulling it out of the bag to get the job done. We couldn’t be achieving what we’re achieving without the work of the ground crew.

The VC10 is now reaching the end of its service life, but continual modifications maintain the aircraft as a significant asset, enabling the rapid deployment of troops and their weaponry, and fast jet fighter aircraft, to any theatre of operations around the world.

Its replacement, the Airbus A330-based AirTanker aircraft, made its first public appearance in the UK on Friday.

Visitors will have the chance not only to explore the ship, but also to chat to the brave men and women who served with distinction during the Libya hostilities:

As well as holding two receptions for invited guests during her stay, the ship’s company is particularly honoured to be invited to perform the age-old tradition of the Ceremony of the Constable’s Dues at the Tower of London.

Dating back to the 14th century or before, this is a real rum-do, when the captain of a visiting Royal Navy vessel must deliver a barrel of grog to the Constable of the Tower in exchange for the protection of the Tower’s guns while alongside.

This time, the traditional barrel of rum will be delivered to the fortress by Liverpool’s Commanding Officer, Commander Colin Williams, and members of his crew, to the accompaniment of the Band of Her Majesty’s Royal Marines from HMS Collingwood in Hampshire.

Commander Williams said:

This visit is one of celebration and appreciation of the sterling service which this exceptional ship has offered her country during her three decades at sea.

I am extremely proud to have commanded her and her crew - there is obviously some sadness in bidding farewell to any ship, but, more than anything, this is a time to honour HMS Liverpool and her achievements, the most recent of which was outstanding and key support to theNATO(North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) operations off the coast of Libya.

I sincerely hope that as many Londoners as possible will make the journey to West India Docks to visit the ship on Sunday when we open to the public.

HMS Liverpool sailed at the end of March 2011 to support Operation UNIFIED PROTECTOR where her tasks included enforcing the no-fly zone and conducting embargo operations to prevent arms from reaching pro-Gaddafi forces by sea.

During this high-tempo mission to protect Libyan citizens, HMS Liverpool’s ship’s company spent 81 hours at action stations on 28 separate occasions, were fired at and returned fire 10 times, and launched 211 rounds of illumination and high explosive shells from her 4.5-inch (114mm) gun.

These illumination or star shells were fired to light up pro-Gaddafi positions forNATOaircraft to identify and destroy.

The ship’s company witnessed the siege of Misurata and the fall of Tripoli, Zlitan, Al Khums and Sirte to the rebels and, while enforcing the no-fly zone, Liverpool’s Fighter Controllers spent 360 hours controlling 14 different types of aircraft from a number ofNATOcountries.

During her deployment, HMS Liverpool worked alongside many other Royal Navy assets, including minehunters HMS Brocklesby and HMS Bangor.

On the occasions that the minehunters had to search for and destroy any mines that had been laid, HMS Liverpool stood by as protection to allow the ships to successfully complete their missions.

Assault ship HMS Ocean and her embarked Apache helicopters were also on national tasking in the area, with HMS Liverpool able to provide assistance as an air defence platform and to give an intelligence picture.

All the UK assets were supported by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) ship Fort Rosalie which provided vital stores when needed - HMS Liverpool herself conducted 40 Replenishments at Sea with the RFA ship, embarking vital supplies and fuel.

Commander Williams continued:

I am immensely proud of my ship’s company and the way in which they rose to their challenge and reacted to the very real threat posed by pro-Gaddafi forces.

For seven months HMS Liverpool was at the sharp end of Royal Navy operations, spending 360 hours controlling aircraft, firing hundreds of rounds, and spending long periods at action stations.

We became the first Royal Navy ship to be fired upon in 30 years and my ship’s company responded by putting their training into action, returning fire in self-defence and destroying enemy positions ashore.

In their efforts to protect the Libyan people and enforce the will of the United Nations, the ship’s company proved their grit and determination.",New Defence Industrial Strategy,Other,Legislative,id25_984

Operating from Gioia del Colle air base in southern Italy, the tempo of operations has been relentless, and IX (Bomber) Squadron has been at the forefront of the mission.

The Tornado Squadron was one of the first fast jet squadrons to deploy to the area. Officer Commanding IX (Bomber) Squadron, Wing Commander Andy Turk, explained how quickly they had to prepare:

We deployed here at very rapid notice; we had returned from our pre-deployment training exercise in the United States.

In fact, we got back on the Monday, by the Wednesday we were ‘spinning up’ for ops and on the Friday we were prepared to launch; an historic 3,000-mile [4,800km] Storm Shadow sortie - the first UK-launched combat sortie since the Second World War.

With nearly 30 years’ front line service, the Tornado aircraft have been proving their worth.

Over the skies of Libya they have integrated closely with the Typhoons; indeed, with their combined, multi-role capabilities, they have proven to be a ‘powerful and potent’ force.

Wing Commander Turk described how this integration has contributed to the success of the RAF’s air campaign and has earned the respect of the coalition:

Whilst the Tornado looks much the same as the one rolled out the factory 30 years ago, inside it’s a completely different animal; it’s all down to avionics upgrades and now its capability is just remarkable.

It stands out in the coalition because of the selectable options we can provide in the air; with its targeting pod, the variety of weapons and being a two-man crew means it is a particularly effective platform.

This capability is further improved when combined with a Typhoon, you have three guys over a target providing a very potent package of air power.

Wing Commander Andy Turk, Officer Commanding IX (Bomber) Squadron  [Picture: Corporal Babbs Robinson, Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]

But it’s not all about the aircrew, the engineers and air maintenance mechanics (AMMs) of IX (Bomber) Squadron have been working 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week to keep the aircraft flying, allowing them to complete all their missions; it’s been a huge team effort. Wing Commander Turk added:

We’re a really tight team, from the engineers to the aircrew. With the rapidly changing environment that we’re operating in, we have frequently had to scramble aircraft to support the ground effort in Libya and protect the civilian population from attack.

The guys have been pulling out all the stops and they never fail to deliver to get our aircraft flying. The only way that happens is by having really sharp engineering management, leadership at all levels, and then having the professionalism and dedication of the guys; they truly are inspirational.

Senior Aircraftman Daniel Poole is an AMM with IX (Bomber) Squadron; Op ELLAMY is his first experience of being deployed.

His training and the support from his fellow engineers has ensured he’s fully prepared to deal with whatever challenges may arise, but nothing can prepare them for the intense heat:

I underestimated how hot it was going to be; when you’re working around hot engines and you’re stood for any length of time in your overalls, it’s boiling and you’re just dripping in sweat,” he said.

It’s at its worst when the aircraft lands in the middle of the day; it can be 36 degrees but the engines are so much hotter because they have been flying for about six hours or more, that’s when you’ve got to get underneath and get stuck in to get the oils changed.

It can be tough, but there’s always a good bit of banter; whoever’s first to the jet gets ‘dibs’ on the part they’re servicing - you learn quick!

Despite the unyielding pace of operations, the Tornado Force has never failed to deliver, reaching almost 1,400 sorties in just over six months.

Flight Sergeant Simon Roberts, an avionics engineer by trade, has worked on Tornados for over 30 years. He said:

There’s a massive sense of satisfaction when you can get all the aircraft ready in time and out and they come back having successfully completed a mission without any problems.

That justifies coming out here, it justifies all the hard work prior to us deploying and all the hard work whilst we’re here in theatre.

IX (Bomber) Squadron is now the only UK fast jet capability in theatre and the experienced and committed air and ground crews remain determined to make a positive difference to the Libyan people. Wing Commander Turk said:

The best thing is to go back to the engineers and say ‘you know when you saw me off, and we had that crew in ‘snag’, you worked really hard and I could see the sweat pouring from your brow; well, we got airborne and we saved a dozen villagers from pro-Gaddafi tanks driving down the main road heading in their direction’.

The guys’ jaws literally drop and then they understand the whole reason for it and why they’re working so hard.

They’re even more dedicated knowing the bigger picture and that their contribution is having tangible effects on the ground. It’s important they understand that. It’s quite moving actually.",£250m Wildcat in-service support and training contract with AgustaWestland,Welfare,Administrative,id25_985

Among the finalists was Operation Guardian in Woking, which was visited today by Minister for Crime Prevention James Brokenshire. It was set up to tackle the supply of class A drugs after increasing levels of concern among residents about drugs users and dealers in the area. Police initiated the operation with raids, test purchases and stop and searches.

Other finalists came from Lancashire, Northampton, Norfolk, Peckham, Warwickshire, Doncaster, Stockton, Hamilton, Cardiff and Caerau, South Wales.

Minister for Crime Prevention James Brokenshire said:

“Empowering communities to find local solutions to local problems is a key foundation of the Big Society we want to build. These awards recognise where it is already happening and we can all learn lessons from that.

“They show that when police, councils, charities and the public work together they can achieve real results. I want to congratulate all the finalists on their achievements.”

The Tilley Awards were set up in 1999 to recognise crime fighting projects where police, community safety groups and the public work in partnership using innovative and strategic methods to tackle problems identified by their local communities.

More than 110 projects entered this year’s awards. An overall winner will be named later this year.

The Tilley Award is named after Professor Nick Tilley, who has carried out considerable work in the UK, often commissioned by the Home Office, to develop problem-oriented policing. The awards are funded by the Home Office to encourage and spread best practice in crime fighting approaches across England and Wales.

Firstly to play his part in improving the country’s fiscal position and he said his second commitment…,Ministry of Defence and The Rt Hon Liam Fox,20 July 2010,"Dr Fox said he was committed to two things. Firstly to play his part in improving the country’s fiscal position and he said his second commitment is:

To ensure that in this rapidly changing and dangerous world, and in this tough fiscal climate, the UK has appropriate defences for the threats we face.

He added:

I am determined to ensure the UK retains robust and well equipped Armed Forces capable of intervening abroad where necessary to protect our security and interests at home.

That would mean, when the national interest demands, maritime-enabled power projection, the capacity to control air-space to guarantee freedom of manoeuvre and the ability to deploy land power with the logistical strength to sustain it.

However, Dr Fox said:

The current Defence programme is entirely unaffordable, especially if we try to do what we need to do in the future while simultaneously doing everything we have done in the past.

Dr Fox said these are the unavoidable realities which govern the Strategic Defence and Security Review adding:

The fiscal realities will unavoidably limit the amount of money the Government has available for Defence procurement in the years ahead.

So in this austere climate, to ensure this process is not detrimental either to our national security or to the prospects of one of our most profitable and successful industries, the Government is looking to find new ways of encouraging business. So there is a deal here to be struck.

The British Government will support the UK Defence Industry as a strategic asset; we will support the drive for exports with an active and innovative programme of Defence Diplomacy.

We will ensure that our licensing system works efficiently while ensuring responsible exports.

We will develop innovative training and exercise support in conjunction with industry.

We will ensure that our own requirements for new equipment are designed from their inception with exportability in mind.

We will continue to ensure a dedicated focal point for Government support to exports, and let me pay tribute to the achievements the UKTI Defence and Security Organisation.

We will reform our acquisition processes and provide our suppliers with increased clarity and predictability including a 10-year planning horizon agreed with the Treasury, audited by the NAO every year.

And I am pleased to confirm that a new Defence Industrial Strategy will be published after the SDSR has concluded.

Dr Fox said that as part of the Strategic Defence and Security Review work there are three things that must be understood between the government and industry:

First, without cost containment in the current programmes we have no option but to either cut the programmes currently underway or curtail investment in future programmes.

Second, we must reduce fleet numbers that provide any one capability because we cannot afford the luxury of multiple supply chains and the associated training and infrastructure costs.

Third, too often in the past we have simply replaced old platforms with an upgraded version of the same sort of equipment.

If we continue to spend money on the next generation of what we already have, we will never give ourselves the opportunity to reshape expenditure plans to take into account the need to invest in the technology that is necessary to maintain our advantage in the constant battle for the upper hand in national security.

So we will all need to think differently - and this is part of my challenge to you today.

We need to make a conceptual leap and develop new capabilities that help us stay ahead of our opponents - particularly when faced with asymmetrical threats.

We need to think carefully about what the 21st century battle space requires.

The Somerset-based firm is benefiting from the £250m support and training contract that is sustaining 500 jobs.

The MOD is buying 34 Army Wildcats and 28 maritime attack variants, which will replace the Lynx fleet operated by the Army Air Corps and Fleet Air Arm.

The first Wildcats to be handed over to the MOD are Army helicopters, which will come into service in 2014. The first Royal Navy Wildcats are due to be delivered for training later this year before coming into service in 2015.

The Army Wildcat will primarily be used in a reconnaissance role, providing protection to soldiers on the ground. The maritime attack version will protect the Navy’s fleet around the world.

Both variants have more powerful engines than the Lynx, enabling Wildcat to be used on operations all-year-round in extreme conditions. The Wildcat also has a more robust fuselage to give better protection to the crews.

Both variants are armed with general purpose and heavy machine guns and the Navy’s helicopters will also carry Sting Ray torpedoes. Army and Navy pilots will use high-tech interactive displays thanks to state-of-the-art glass cockpits.

The £250m Wildcat in-service support and training contract with AgustaWestland will provide a specialist training centre at Royal Naval Air Station Yeovilton, where the Wildcats will be based, that will include flight simulators and a wide range of other equipment to train pilots, ground crew and engineers.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said:

Wildcat represents a considerable advance over the current Lynx helicopters, bringing greatly improved performance and capability. The contract to provide training and support will keep them flying wherever they are needed.

These helicopters will be a key part of the future equipment programme for the Armed Forces that will see £160bn spent over the next ten years. By balancing the budget, we can deliver the airframes and the millions of pounds of support they require.

Chief of the General Staff General Sir Peter Wall said:

This is an excellent helicopter, which is very important to the Army Air Corps. We will be seeking to get it fully operational as soon as possible.

Chief of the Naval Staff, First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, said:

Wildcat represents the latest generation of multi-role helicopter that has been specifically procured to operate from ships of the Royal Navy. With state-of-the-art sensors, equipment and weapons, it will be an outstanding asset that will maintain Royal Naval units at the cutting-edge of worldwide maritime operations.","Providing musical support to British forces, entertaining troops and boosting their morale.",Welfare,,id25_988

Speaking to personnel on the ship’s flight deck, General Richards said:

I have a lot of history with this fine ship and so I’m really glad to have had the opportunity to visit you.

What you did in Libya and the way you have responded over the last few months have been in the best traditions of the Service; not only have you done great work operationally but you have broken new barriers professionally, particularly with the Apache.

The name of HMS Ocean is held in high regard back in the UK and you should be proud, and deservedly so, of what you have achieved.

During the operation in support of the UN Security Council Resolution, the Apache attack helicopters embarked on HMS Ocean complemented the RAF Tornado and Typhoon aircraft, delivering additional precision-strike capability.

Over the course of their deployment, the Apache crews from 656 Squadron Army Air Corps carried out highly effective missions inside Libya, hitting military vehicles, installations and communications equipment.

The Apaches were ably assisted during the operation by other helicopters embarked on HMS Ocean. These included Sea King Mk7s of 857 Naval Air Squadron conducting maritime surveillance operations, and Lynx Mk7s of 847 Naval Air Squadron providing force protection and logistic support, as well as US Air Force HH-60 Pave Hawks.

The US airmen, from the 56th Rescue Squadron based at RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk, were on standby for personnel recovery or medical evacuation operations in the event of an incident involving any NATO aircraft or ships.

Captain Andrew Betton, HMS Ocean’s Commanding Officer, said:

I am immensely proud of all of the personnel serving in HMS Ocean. Everybody has worked tirelessly since we sailed in April to contribute to our evolving mission, so having the opportunity to brief the Chief of Defence Staff on our recent activity was an honour.

In the four months that HMS Ocean was operating off Libya, the ship spent 87 days at sea, whilst, during the same period, the Apaches were allocated some 49 missions and the Sea King Mk7s a total of 99 operational sorties.

Since sailing from the UK in late April, Ocean has sailed over 23,000 nautical miles (42,600km) and there have been in excess of 2,000 deck landings by a mix of both embarked and visiting aircraft.

HMS Ocean left the UK in April as part of the UK’s Response Force Task Group to conduct a series of pre-planned amphibious exercises in the Mediterranean, known as Cougar 11. With the escalating events in Libya, the UK Government took the opportunity in May to retask one of the most flexible ships in the Royal Navy’s inventory and ordered HMS Ocean to support the enforcement of the United Nations Security Council Resolution to protect Libyan citizens.

I could be in Miami. Yet, after a 12-hour flight, I am in fact back exactly where I started, standing on the runway at RAF Akrotiri.

I have just had the privilege of accompanying the five-man crew of a Sentinel on a surveillance mission off the coast of Libya.

The Sentinel R1 is a modified version of the executive business jet manufactured by Bombardier. But instead of the gold taps and marble trimmings favoured by the rich and famous, the interior is stripped back to the bare essentials. The big money has been spent on radar pods and banks of computers.

Luxury items on this trip were confined to a warm Mars bar and a blocked toilet - a feature which may have dampened our feet but did nothing to dampen the spirits of the crew on board.

The only other luxury is the hyper-efficient air-conditioning, but that is for the benefit of the computer hardware, not the crew. It may be 38 degrees Celsius out on the pan, but at 40,000 feet (12km), when it’s minus 50 degrees outside, and the air-conditioning is doing its thing, you really need to be wearing that thermal underwear.

The aircraft is designed to comfortably gobble up long distances at heights up to 49,000 feet (15km) on a regular basis; essential qualities for missions like the one I have just been on.

When it comes to getting a God’s-eye view of the world, the closer to God you can fly, the greater the area you can see - and, in Sentinel’s case, with extraordinary clarity:

We can cover a large area,” explained Flight Lieutenant Phill, the Air Mission Commander (AMC) - such is the security level of these sorties, only the crew’s first names can be used.

Surveillance using unmanned air vehicles [UAVs] is more like looking down a drinking straw. One of the things we can do is provide the information needed to deploy another asset like a UAV to take a closer look at something more specific.

As the AMC, Flight Lieutenant Phill is the tactical lead for the sortie. Based on what NATO and/or the MOD’s Permanent Joint Headquarters want him to look at, he plans the mission, and it is the pilots’ job to get him to those locations quickly and efficiently, and hold a pattern so he and his two image analysts, Sergeants Simon and Chris, can get eyes on the ground for as long as they need:

We have a Synthetic Aperture Radar to take fixed imagery and a Ground Moving Target Indicator to track ground movement of, well, whatever we need to,” Flight Lieutenant Phill added.

After a couple of hours we enter the no-fly zone. Out of one of the small cabin windows the Libyan coastline can be seen thousands of feet below, through narrow wisps of cloud. Over the headsets we hear American voices asking for aircraft ID. That given, the crew carry on with the task in hand.

A large part of Sentinel’s work is to build up, day after day, an understanding of the pattern of life below, so anything out of the ordinary can be spotted and investigated.

And it pays to take nothing for granted:

People may think that if we see movement at night it must be Gaddafi’s troops or the rebels,” said Sergeant Chris, “but we’re finding that life for the locals largely cracks on as normal, and it can be very busy at night. We need to know what’s normal so we can spot the abnormal.

Because Sentinel can generate a persistent coverage of such a wide area, it provides NATO with a unique capability - which is crucial when you are dealing with a country the size of Libya.

Key logistic nodes and pro-regime forces can be identified, combat aircraft can be efficiently deployed, and the risk of misidentifying things on the ground is reduced.

During the sortie the analysts build up what they call a quick and dirty report of what they have seen. On landing, the massive amount of data amassed over the sortie is handed over to a team of analysts who produce a more detailed report.

But how do the crews manage to keep concentrating during these 12-hour stints?

It helps to keep busy, and we’ve got reports to write while we go, and we have drills to follow every hour, so that helps,” said Flight Lieutenant Phill.

And, Sergeant Chris added:

You can be working like the proverbial one-armed paper-hanger, but if you are an analyst you tend to be the nosey type, so you don’t want to miss anything.

For the pilots, the aircraft’s superb automatic pilot system helps take the strain:

It’s a real godsend. When you’ve been flying for 11 hours, or through mucky weather, it takes the edge off, so you are fresh for the landing which is always the most difficult part of the flight,” said the captain, Flight Lieutenant Neil. “That’s what everyone judges you on.

It may look like we are doing nothing when we are pootling round in loops, but we are constantly checking things, planning what we would do if there was a problem, so if something does happen, we have already thought that through and know what we are going to do.

And when we are not doing that we imagine where we could be if we’d flown in a straight line; for example, we are half-way through the mission and let’s see,” he checks the instruments and makes a quick calculation, “yes, we could now be in Milan, or Bucharest.

But instead, Flight Lieutenant Neil has two more ‘stops’ to make before he can take us home, full-speed to Miami, or… well we can dream.

But thanks to body armour doing its job, the quick thinking of his fellow Royal Marines, and the excellent work of medics, he’s back on the front line.

Mne Nash, 40 Commando Royal Marines, said:

I was working in my patrol base, building up the defences on the roof.

Just as I was about to climb down to get some water, a single round hit me in the left arm.

It went through and into the side plate of my body armour and knocked me clean off the roof. It felt like a car had hit me in the ribs.

I looked down at my arm and I could see the blood, but the other lads instantly got an emergency care bandage on me to stop the bleeding.

A Jackal patrol vehicle took Mne Nash to a forward operating base from where a Chinook was used to take him to the field hospital in Camp Bastion:

I was at the base within 15 minutes of getting hit and the Medical Evacuation Response Team was waiting for me,” said Mne Nash.

Once I got to the hospital at Bastion I was straight into the operating theatre.

The whole process from the first shot to waking up after surgery was about four hours.

It was unbelievable - the medical chain is amazing.

You hear stories about it but it’s only when you experience it for yourself that you really see how good it is.

Mne Nash stayed in hospital under observation for two days where the wound was packed, and five days later he went back to have 20 stitches to close the wound.

Mne Nash has now rejoined his colleagues in Sangin.

Major Mark Suddaby said:

We have now become advisory teams. In each of the Kandak or Tolay locations (types of ANA units) we have a two man team which is usually an officer and a sergeant. Their job is to advise and mentor the ANA in their everyday duties, operations and administration.

The advisory teams mirror the locations of the ISAF and ANA ground holding troops. In these locations, ANA troops are partnering with ISAF forces to allow them to learn necessary military skills:

We mentor them on their patrols, we help them with the planning of those patrols, and we go through after action reviews with them.

We also look at their living conditions and see what we can do to improve these.

It really goes across all the strands, from manning through to operations, through to planning, signals etc…we’re trying to build the ANA into a modern army,” said Major Suddaby.

The 1 SCOTS team in each location decides on the areas that the ANA needs to develop and conducts lessons using both demonstrations and interpreters. Recently, Fourth Tolay has undertaken training in casualty extraction drills, what to do under fire and administration on operations.

Instructor Corporal Kevin Hope commented:

Actions speak louder than words when doing this, so if we do a lot of demos they pick it up a lot quicker than if we just speak to them. What they see they will do.

Today we have been working with the Fourth Tolay ANA to bring them on with their casualty extraction drills.

It is important for future ops together, we need to know that if an ISAF soldier falls or ANA soldier falls, we are singing off the same song sheet. So today we have just spent three hours going through our casualty extraction drills.

Fourth Tolay will be conducting a range of joint operations with the Combined Force Nad ‘Ali over the coming months.

Supporting the growth in capacity and capability of the Afghan Security Forces, through training and mentoring, is an essential part of NATO’s strategy in Afghanistan.

The sooner the Afghans can take responsibility for their own security and carry out security operations without the need for ISAF support, ensuring the long-term security and stability of the country, the sooner British forces can come home.

Such ammunition normally has a six-month life on the front line, with extreme temperature changes typically found during the day and night speeding up the time when it becomes less stable to use.

Ammunition is also often changed for new when replacement British units arrive to serve in theatre.

Despite careful management and storage, ammunition also degrades after being carried around in pouches, vehicles and helicopters for months, with sand, dirt and water having an impact.

Disposal in-theatre is cheaper than bringing it back to the UK.

Project Manager, Major Nick Stanford, of Defence Equipment and Support’s Defence General Munitions Team, said:

This unique urgent operational requirement has been a challenge from the outset, whether complying with civilian arms controls, pollution legislation, or for the world’s largest cargo aircraft to fly it to Afghanistan, in addition to the normal project pressures, issues and safety concerns.

The provider, UK-based EOD Solutions, provides proven equipment with support for demilitarisation tasks around the world.

The incinerator offers sufficient capacity to cope with the demanding conditions that it will be operating in for the next two years.

Team leader, Colonel Richard Aspray, added:

This unique solution to a challenging task will aid our redeployment, thus freeing up resources in Afghanistan and the UK, enabling their efficient use over an extremely busy period for Defence.

In the weeks running up to the deployment, the men and women onboard HMS Bangor worked tirelessly, ensuring that the sophisticated vessel was ready for the operation.

The vessel made excellent time to the Med, making just a swift stop at Brest in France for a two-hour refuelling sop and even managed to stop at Gibraltar where the crew were allowed off to stretch their legs, with some even managing to run up the famous Gibraltar Rock.

After her brief visit, HMS Bangor was soon underway again, heading through the Mediterranean Sea to the coast of Libya.

The flat calm waters allowed the crew to undertake training and upper-deck maintenance, ensuring that the ship arrives in theatre fully trained and ready for operations.

HMS Bangor is one of seven Sandown class mine hunters - five of which are based at HM Naval Base Clyde with another two permanently deployed in the Gulf.

Built of glass reinforced plastic, the design ensures that the ship has a very low magnetic signature, essential when operating in a minefield.

The Sandown class vessels are equipped with the latest precise navigation and manoeuvring systems, allowing them to ‘hover’ over a fixed point and search for mines with their variable depth sonar.

Bangor can then deploy her clearance divers or latest state-of-the-art submersible to deal with the mines or suspicious objects.

Since Christmas, HMS Bangor has been put through her paces on Operational Sea Training in preparation for a deployment with the Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Group to the North Sea later this year.

She has also completed a major maintenance period, gearing up the ship to sail from UK waters for six-months.",Increased funding (£1.8bn) and consultation process,Monetary,"Other (strategic plans, consultations)",id25_998

Jonathan Lyle: Dstl is a trading fund of the MOD. We exist to maximise the impact of science and technology for UK defence and security. We work with the best people and the best ideas in the world. Working with both large and small companies and with universities we develop battle-winning technologies.

We provide support to UK operations both now and in the future. Also, we look after some niche areas which are sensitive or operationally-critical, and where there are international connections which need to be handled within government.

DF: How do you deliver this expertise?

JL: We help our customers across government by giving advice to support business cases. We do research that informs their requirements, and we provide test and evaluation at the end of a project. Two years ago the management of the defence research programme was put into Dstl.

At first, industry were concerned by that as they thought we would eat all the pies and spend all the budget in-house. In fact, last year 60 per cent of the programme was spent externally.

DF: Who are your main customers?

JL: As a trading fund our money flows from customers in MOD and other government departments. Our annual turnover is about £550m, about £400m of that comes from the Defence Research Board’s non-nuclear research programme which is owned by the Chief Scientific Adviser. There’s a range of people in MOD who draw on that who come to us for help.

That includes policy, capability and operational customers in the UK, front line commands and the Surgeon General. Our next biggest customer is Defence Equipment and Support [DE&S]. Last year £90m of Dstl’s income was for supporting DE&S by delivering specific tasks and projects. We also do a lot of work for Defence Intelligence.

DF: How do you help in the acquisition process?

JL: We support DE&S in many ways such as assembling evidence for decisions, evaluating new concepts, technology development, and supporting urgent operational requirements. In addition, we execute a research programme which is, in large part, exploited through MOD’s equipment programme.

DF: Have you any examples of where that research has made a difference for acquisition?

JL: Open systems architectures on ships, aircraft and land vehicles have enabled cost-effective and rapid upgrades to platforms. Working with colleagues in Abbey Wood [DE&S] and with key vehicle suppliers in the Land area we have created what we call a generic vehicle architecture.

This means that any new electronic systems, whether they be defensive aid or surveillance systems, as they evolve and develop, can be plugged and played easily into the system through a standard software interface. That means you can get more rapid and effective upgrades which has a big effect on through-life costs and efficiency.

DF: How can research save MOD money?

JL: Last year we conducted a trial in Cyprus looking at ways to save fuel at forward operating bases (FOBs). The cost of getting a gallon of fuel to a FOB is huge. We mocked up an environment to be like Afghanistan.

We demonstrated that using a range of technology such as insulation, solar panels and other energy management techniques we could save 40 per cent of the energy used in theatre. Some of those things are deployable straight away, some will have to be developed.

DF: Has Dstl played a part in supporting operations?

JL: We have played a huge role supporting operations both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, and more recently in Libya. In Afghanistan there have been more than 350 separate theatre deployments by Dstl personnel over ten years to support in-theatre trials and provide scientific advice and operational analysis.

We are very proud of the direct support we have provided to the front line, working closely with Permanent Joint Headquarters [PJHQ].

DF: What sort of things do you get involved with?

JL: We apply scientific method to help address the challenges in theatre. We have worked on heat stress, looked at water requirements for troops on patrol, and force protection of vehicles and dismounted soldiers in open areas. We have developed approaches to counter sniper threats and the whole spectrum of the IED environment.

Our role is to give a very quick response to issues that arise in theatre. We look at methods, techniques and technologies to provide solutions. We have access to a lot of intellectual knowledge that we can call on.

We trial the ideas in theatre and if, as has happened so many times, they have merit, they are turned into operational requirements which we hand over in a managed way to our colleagues in DE&S.

But not all solutions are equipment, some of them are changes in tactics or procedure, which is again where our advice, based on operational analysis, can help the commander on the ground.

DF: How do you strike a balance between being reactive and proactive?

JL: We have priorities set for us by PJHQ. Our scientists in theatre have a 24-hour reach-back service to Dstl and to our suppliers in industry and in universities. The scientist says ‘I have a problem’ and this intellectual network is harnessed to hand back advice quickly.

In that sense it is reactive. But that reactive expertise is built on the proactive investment in the research programme, and the capability that has allowed us to build up over the years. The technology we have on the shelf is only there because five or maybe ten years ago someone put investment into the research programme.

I know that senior colleagues in MOD’s London Main Building absolutely get that. Investment in people, technology networks and facilities is what sustains your capability in the future.

DF: So part of your role is looking at the technology of tomorrow as well as today?

JL: Yes, we deal with a huge spectrum, from supporting operations to looking at the far future. Our horizon-scanning team looks at technology that could be of advantage to us. The important thing is to try and spot the trends and use that to set your priorities for the programme.

In the medium term we have people looking at the equipment capability that will be needed from 2020 and beyond, and what systems and technology we will need to invest in to deliver that.

DF: How far ahead is the horizon you are scanning?

JL: That’s the amazing thing about technology horizons, they can be very long or very short. People keep reminding me the next generation in computer technology is 18 months away, not 25 years. Horizon-scanning is about looking beyond the immediate.

DF: Does Dstl’s success depend on the quality of its staff even more than most organisations?

JL: From the day I walked through the door two years ago as Director of the Programme Office, I was bowled over by the enthusiasm and professionalism of the workforce; everyone, not just the scientists and engineers, but across all the parts of the organisation.

It is important that we continue to invest in the workforce. I’ve been struck by how even quite recent graduates, because of the work they are doing, demonstrate a deep understanding of defence systems and how our Armed Forces work.

It is important that we have people who have the expertise to help the MOD with its challenges. That means not just understanding the technical side, but understanding the customer as well.

DF: Is it difficult to recruit the people you need?

JL: We are still attracting some fantastic graduates from top quality universities with top qualifications. We will have to be watchful as the economy picks up as recruiting and retaining these people will get harder.

I would say that those who choose to work for Dstl do so because of the quality and range of the work, the chance to work closely with the customer, and the fact that we recognise scientific excellence.

DF: So what’s the biggest thing on your desk?

JL: Three things shape my job: austerity, current and future operations, and the transformation happening across Defence. With the empowerment of front line command, we will have to adapt the way we work with customers.

Some staff are worried that we will be doing less science. We will be doing shed loads of science, but we have to get better at programme and customer management. The relocation of staff from our Fort Halstead establishment in Kent is also one of the biggest things for me to deliver and in a way that treats the workforce fairly and properly.

DF: How do you keep these plates spinning?

JL: By having a fantastic team. It’s a tremendous privilege to lead an organisation that plays such an important role in the nation’s defence and security.

1000,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/surgeon-general-discusses-importance-of-partnerships--2,News story,Surgeon General discusses importance of partnerships,"Surgeon Vice Admiral Raffaelli started his speech saying that the exceptional care we are delivering to our soldiers, sailors and airmen is …",Ministry of Defence,19 January 2012,"Surgeon Vice Admiral Raffaelli started his speech saying that the exceptional care we are delivering to our soldiers, sailors and airmen is absolutely dependent on our approach to partnerships, adding that there is none more important than the one that we enjoy with the Department of Health and the NHS in the UK.

Surgeon Vice Admiral Raffaelli commented on the various external sources that have very favourably assessed our military medical systems, such as the House of Commons Defence Committee, National Audit Office and Healthcare Commission, who, he said, used the term ‘exemplary’ for the first time ever to describe Defence Medical Services (DMS) trauma and rehabilitation services.

More recently, Surgeon Vice Admiral Raffaelli said that the House Of Commons Defence Committee had published the first part of its review of the Armed Forces Covenant, focusing on military casualties.

The report commented on ‘the extraordinary quality of care given to our Armed Forces almost from the point of wounding’ and ‘commends the Armed Forces medical services for the improvement in all aspects of the medical treatment of injured personnel in theatre’.

Surgeon Vice Admiral Raffaelli said:

Today, while there are many challenges to being Surgeon General during a period of war, Iraq and Afghanistan have provided the background and the drivers for military medicine to move forward in a number of areas, especially where our requirements differ from those experienced in the NHS.

The severe trauma found on operations from improvised explosive devices and high velocity gunshot wounds contrasts with the level of trauma commonly experienced in the NHS where motor vehicle accidents predominate.

The sheer number of these cases that our people are experiencing on operations is also far greater than that in the NHS.

Surgeon Vice Admiral Raffaelli told the conference that when Colonel Mike Stewart, the then Defence Consultant Advisor in Orthopaedics, gave the eponymous Robert Jones address to the British Orthopaedic Association, he reported that the number of traumatic amputations seen in a typical six-week period in the UK Role 3 Hospital at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan is greater than that usually seen throughout the six years of specialist training to be an orthopaedic surgeon. He added:

Despite the ferocity of these wounds, a lower percentage of injured personnel are dying of wounds than at any time in the past.

But he added, while we have undoubtedly made tremendous strides in many areas, there still remains much to do and to understand better.

Surgeon Vice Admiral Raffaelli said:

Our success has resulted from a variety of initiatives, and these and other innovations will be an important feature of this conference. But it can be too easy to focus on such technical innovations, so further work is required to identify the contribution of each part. We also need to ensure that our treatment, as well as saving life, maximises the quality of life.

Moreover, we are just starting to see those who have been most seriously injured emerging from their initial, extended period of rehabilitation. They will pose novel challenges which will require addressing, in conjunction with the NHS and others, as we support them into the future.

And the very experience of war inevitably challenges and changes people and, for some, this can affect their mental health either at the time or later, so we continue to work with the Department of Health and others to support those affected.

So there is much still to do and I am pleased to say that, even in these difficult financial times, this remains a high priority to the Government.

He said that we benchmark against the NHS and our principal allies and we aim to ensure that when personnel leave service they will be transferred efficiently to the NHS and continue to receive a high standard of care. He continued:

I believe that one of the keys to our high quality care today is this reference to the National Health Service and to our allies. In the UK the NHS provides healthcare for all and dominates all aspects of healthcare.

For the DMS that means our patients will have come from the NHS and will return to it after service. For our staff, they will undertake much of their professional training in the NHS and they maintain and develop their skills in the NHS, and they collaborate on research with the NHS, and many will find further employment in the NHS once they leave service.

The Defence Medical Services have long recognised that inter-dependency and have established strong partnerships with the different parts of the NHS. That is important, indeed critical, for us, as is our relationship with our international partners.

Surgeon Vice Admiral Raffaelli said that his clinical priorities since taking up office have been:

He added:

These are intended to focus all of our activities in support of the MOD’s declared main effort which is, of course, today the conflict in Afghanistan.

Surgeon Vice Admiral Raffaelli asked what does that mean in practice? A good example he said is military trauma, which is different to UK civilian trauma. He said the energy involved tends to be greater and also frequently involves blast injuries, either directly or indirectly, and patients’ wounds are frequently heavily contaminated and infected.

Surgeon Vice Admiral Raffaelli said that the Defence Medical Services mission is to provide healthcare, medical operational capability and health advice to maximise the fighting power of the Armed Forces so that our troops are fit for role, with as few as possible unfit for operational deployment.

Surgeon Vice Admiral Raffaelli said that a National Audit Office review estimated the rate of military unexpected survivors as a proportion of all seriously injured survivors to be up to 25 per cent. The rate of unexpected survivors achieved by NHS hospital trusts between 2006 and 2009 ranged up to six per cent:

There are a number of reasons why we are seeing these unexpected survivors,” he said. “Some of it is due to the protective armour provided to soldiers today - which is being incrementally improved based on rapid feedback from the medical analysis of injury patterns.

But I believe the principal reason is due to the care of Service personnel on operations today being provided by a wide range of people at every stage of the patient journey working in closely developed systems so that the care provided is seamless and integrated.

And we audit and review continuously to identify best practice and feed the lessons learnt back into the training pathway. And we continue to seek external review; the Care Quality Commission - the successor to the Healthcare Commission - is currently carrying out an end-to-end assessment of the DMS.

And I believe that the integrated end-to-end nature of our patient care pathway, with clinical guidelines based on evidence, is one reason we are saving so many people.

Surgeon Vice Admiral Raffaelli said that the UK Role 3 Hospital at Camp Bastion, the busiest trauma hospital in Afghanistan and probably in the world today, is achieving such success because patient care at Bastion is not only consultant-led but also very much a team effort, with integrated care involving anaesthetists, emergency medicine, orthopaedics, plastics and general surgery often working together at the same time on the same patient, moving together if required through the emergency department into theatre.

He continued:

But if you go to the hospital and observe the teams at work, you will not be able to tell at first glance which are Army, Navy or RAF, which are Regular or Reserve, who are Allied clinicians or direct support from NHS personnel or even contractors.

But we train them to work as integrated teams at the 2 Medical Brigade Army Medical Services Training Centre at Strensall and also at the Royal College of Surgeons of England training facility on the MOST course - Military Operational Surgical Training - which is run in partnership with the Royal College who are proud to recognise the MOST course as their premier example of simulation training.

Surgeon Vice Admiral Raffaelli said that the care that we provide in Afghanistan also involved a high usage of blood and blood products. He added:

What is not always recognised is that we can do that because of the blood we receive from the Scottish and National Blood Transfusion Services who supply direct from the UK about two-and-a-half times that provided to a typical District General Hospital in the UK.

He continued by saying that:

There will always be a need for us to look to the wider body of secondary care expertise within the NHS - indeed, I see that as the most appropriate model and I also have no doubt that one of the consequences of the Strategic Defence and Security Review will be that we will build on such a model in a number of areas.

But one of the other important lessons has been to recognise the breadth of the partnership which contributes to the end-to-end care pathway today.

Surgeon Vice Admiral Raffaelli talked about the military community of excellence that is being established in the Midlands with, at its core, the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine, established in a partnership agreement with the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust until 2038. He added:

We have also established an academic unit located at the University of Birmingham Academic and Research Park, and we have the Defence School of Healthcare Studies down the road, in partnership with Birmingham City University.

Just up the line, near Lichfield, are my new headquarters and those of the Joint Medical Command, which delivers all joint healthcare and training, and we are bringing the Defence Medical Services Training Group, currently at Keogh Barracks near Aldershot, to the site by 2014. The intent is to bring Defence medical healthcare, innovation and education into one community.

I have no doubt that establishing that community of excellence and developing an ongoing research base is essential if we are to continue to push forward with improvements in patient care and improvements in both survival and quality of life. And we need to continue to do that even after the current conflict ceases as the benefits are of course not only for the military but for all of our patients.

And that is why I am delighted with the establishment of the National Institute for Health Research unit for Surgical Reconstruction and Microbiology.

This initiative is a collaboration between the NHS and the MOD together with our partners in Birmingham. This £20m unit is intended to become the focus for UK trauma research. We are also being supported by the Medical Research Council to the tune of £300,000 to help establish a collaborative network with other interested parties both in the UK and overseas.",Selection of Force Protection Europe as preferred bidder and creation of a programme to procure LPPVs.,Market-based,Monetary,id25_1000

Under the proposals there will be a new relationship between reservists, employers and government, and a transparent approach whereby employers are given more certainty about the timing of possible mobilisations and more notice when they occur.

The measures will create a fully integrated force of regulars and reservists, using similar equipment and training together. It will mean that the Reserves not only provide individual augmentees to regular units, but also deploy as formed units and sub-units.

The number of trained Reserves will grow to around 35,000 across all three Services by 2020, aligning the mix of regular and reserve components with many of our closest allies.

The Army will see the biggest change, with 30,000 trained Reserves, creating a total land force of about 120,000. And the plans are backed by an extra £1.8bn in funding over the next ten years for new equipment, uniforms and training for the Reserves.

The consultation will also look at:

• increasing the number of days Army reservists are required to train from 35 to 40 days a year

• a change of name from Territorial Army to Army Reserve - better reflecting the future role and tasks

• encouraging more ex-regulars to become reservists - making it easier for them to transfer to the Reserves and developing incentives for them to do so.

The Defence Secretary said:

This transformation of the Reserves will see a radical shift in the way in which we use them, with units deployed as formed units or sub-units as well as delivering individual augmentees.

Increased training, better equipment and extra investment in our Reserves are all integral to our vision of a formidable, adaptable and flexible Armed Forces, with a reserve/regular balance more in line with our main allies.

This Government has committed £1.8bn to rebuilding our Reserves. The consultation I have launched today is about working with reservists, their families and employers to use that money to design the Reserve Forces of the future.

The Vice Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir Nick Houghton, said:

Since 2003 there have been over 25,000 reservists mobilised, fighting alongside their regular counterparts. 29 have paid the ultimate price for their country and just this summer we saw 2,000 reservists provide a pivotal security role at the London 2012 Games.

In the future we will become even more reliant on our Reserves. But this increased reliance means that there are key issues that we have to tackle - like our relationship with employers and the notice period ahead of mobilisation - to get this right. I want to encourage everyone to get involved in this consultation and have their say.

The consultation will run until 18 January 2013 and following this we will publish a White Paper in Spring 2013 setting out this new relationship.",Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (CATT),Other,,id25_1001

Major General Nick Pope, the Chief of the Defence Staff’s Communications Officer, said that, during the morning, two formations of aircraft identified concentrations of Colonel Gaddafi’s forces in and around the city of Sirte, where they continue to repress the local population.

The RAF aircraft mounted a series of precision attacks using Paveway and Brimstone guided ordnance, and successfully destroyed four main battle tanks, three armoured personnel carriers, a self-propelled gun, two other armoured vehicles and an artillery piece.

Major General Pope said:

As ever, these and other NATO fast jet missions were made possible by the large fleet of combat support aircraft available to NATO, including RAF VC10 and TriStar tankers, and Sentry and Sentinel surveillance platforms.

The first vehicles are expected to be available to troops for training in 2011. The total number will be subject to negotiation and announced in due course.

The LPPV has been designed to provide unprecedented levels of blast protection for a vehicle of its size, and will be able to carry a crew of up to six people. It will add to the wide array of protected vehicles already being used on operations in Afghanistan, including Mastiff and Ridgback.

Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology, Peter Luff, said:

Small, agile but highly protected, the LPPV is at the forefront of technology. It will offer troops unprecedented levels of blast protection for such a light vehicle, enabling them to carry out a wide range of tasks, whilst moving with ease through narrow alleyways or crossing bridges.

It will be a valuable addition to the vehicles already available to commanders in Afghanistan, and demonstrates the Government’s commitment to providing our troops with the very best equipment on the front line.

I’m delighted to announce that negotiations can now begin to get these vehicles out to theatre as soon as possible.

Chief of Defence Materiel, General Sir Kevin O’Donoghue, said:

A great deal of work has been done to get the programme to this stage. When it comes to vehicle technology, it is clear from this competition that British engineering is leading the way. Both proposed solutions reflect the significant progress made in the development of a new generation of small yet highly protected vehicles.

The LPPV will offer huge benefit to troops in Afghanistan, as well as being a valuable asset to the Armed Forces in the future.

Force Protection Europe has confirmed that, subject to the satisfactory completion of contractual negotiations with MOD, all of the vehicles will be built and supported in the UK.

Before …",Ministry of Defence,4 July 2011,"Two years ago, PlayStation-style war games helped soldiers of 5th Battalion The Rifles (5 RIFLES) get ready for their tour of Iraq.

Before departing for theatre, troops spent hours in simulators and replica operations rooms at the Sennelager Training Centre in Germany, driving virtual vehicles and commanding computer-generated ground patrols.

Many of those soldiers are now gearing up for Op HERRICK 15 and once again the early stages of their pre-deployment preparation took place in cyberspace.

Major Jim Faux of The Rifles oversees mission-specific training at the Sennelager facility. He said the aim was to give personnel a full picture of southern Afghanistan:

We replicate Helmand as closely as we can without getting the real people - it’s not immersion, it’s teaching theatre tactics, techniques and procedures, as well as command and staff drills,” he said.

The simulation is absolutely critical to what we do because there is nowhere else we can exercise like this without putting hundreds of soldiers and vehicles out on the ground.

It’s not quite ‘Call of Duty’ [a popular computer war game] but it’s getting there,” he continued. “We’re seeing the guys go out the door and do very similar missions.

On HERRICK 12, [1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment] carried out an air strike they had rehearsed here, and it was a huge success. 42 Commando [Royal Marines] have also just undertaken an aviation insert with a ground link-up in Nahr-e Saraj district that was similar to one they practised.

Two different training units use the gaming-influenced technology.

The Combined Arms Staff Trainer allows headquarters personnel to fight on-screen battles during a week-long exercise which tests commanders’ plans and the performance of operations room staff.

A separate five-day course at the Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (CATT) sees drivers and ground forces drafted in to digital missions, using vehicle simulators to increase the level of tactical complexity.

Lifelike imagery from theatre is beamed onto flatscreens and backed up by real Afghan actors who are on hand to role-play situations with the exercising troops.

Vehicle Commander Lance Corporal Saul Brunt, 5 RIFLES, said he was impressed with the CATT facility:

I will be working in Mastiff and Husky armoured vehicles in Helmand, and these exercises are exactly what we will be doing on operations,” he said.

It’s good being able to look in-depth on the ground and the zoom is amazing - I can see details such as groups of civilians and herds of goats, and also where IEDs [improvised explosive devices] have been laid.

It’s a bit odd when someone knocks on the simulator door and I have to pull out my best Pashtu, but it’s good because it’s another thing to think about,” he added.

Mastering new weapons and vehicles such as the Sharpshooter rifle and Mastiff remains a key part of pre-deployment training, but modern warfare skills, such as language and cultural awareness, are playing an increasingly important role:

We are checking that these young boys - corporals and riflemen - have the ability to talk to someone through an interpreter and show themselves to be professional and in command of a situation,” said Warrant Officer Class 2 James Byrne, 4th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, who oversees the simulator-based learning in the tactical trainer.

The Afghans will not speak to him if he doesn’t appear confident and starts asking them stupid questions.

I look to see whether they are using the language they have learnt correctly and how they interact with people because that’s a big part of being a vehicle commander.

In the Army today you need to be able to communicate as well as fire a weapon,” he added.

Every effort is made to ensure the simulated experience is as close to reality as possible so troops get maximum benefit from the real-life mission rehearsal exercises that follow:

We had the Close Support Logistics Regiment in here a few weeks ago replicating their communication kit, weapons systems, and spacing drills for vehicles,” said WO2 Byrne.

They were all sorted out before they got behind the wheel. It’s excellent preparation for them.

Perfecting their drills in Helmand-themed simulations will stand personnel from 5 RIFLES in good stead for their battle group role.

The next lesson for the infantry unit will be in using their cyber-honed skills on the proving grounds of the Stanford Training Area and Salisbury Plain, but they will have to wait until the autumn to see the true benefit of the virtual training, when it is put to the test in southern Afghanistan.

Meanwhile, HERRICK-bound headquarters personnel get a taste of computerised conflict during a week-long course at the impressive Combined Arms Staff Trainer (CAST).

The focus is on taking a problem and turning it into a set of military orders, with soldiers working in a brigade or company command setting.

Operations rooms are set up to replicate those found in the forward operating bases in theatre, which instruct Combined Forces responsible for specific areas such as Lashkar Gah or Nad ‘Ali.

All major units deploying to Afghanistan will pass through the CAST at either Sennelager in Germany or Catterick and Warminster in the UK.

The trainers see between 100 and 120 personnel coming together for the first time to form a mission control hub:

We start them off with the basic stuff for day-to-day living on operations, such as patrols, leader engagement and moving food, water and ammo,” said Lieutenant Colonel Nick Channer of The Royal Regiment of Scotland, responsible for running the course at the Sennelager site.

We build up the complexity by giving them a number of intelligence feeds that lead them to an objective, which they will plan to strike.

Intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (ISTAR) detail from Afghanistan has been added to simulations, and those deploying on Op HERRICK 15 will be the first to benefit:

It’s as realistic as it can be,” Lt Col Channer said. “A commander will come in and sit with an Xbox controller and take his patrol out on the ground, and headquarters will see their men moving around on the screens.

Lockheed Martin’s Combined Arms Tactical Trainer is the world’s largest virtual reality training system, allowing up to 400 war-fighters to train together in an immersive computer-generated environment.

More than 140 mock vehicle cabs, turrets and firing points are housed in metal containers in a huge warehouse-like space that is roughly the same size as a football pitch.

Troops under training fight digital foes, with on-screen operations viewed through a simulator’s periscopes or weapon sights.

An adjacent room contains a headquarters from where commanders and intelligence officers can plan and view missions as they unfold.

Entire battle groups can be connected in cyberspace through a local area network that hooks up hundreds of control stations and allows their actions to interact and contribute to synthetic serials.

Personnel are routinely immersed in virtual wars for hours - and the level of reality is such that some will experience ‘simulation sickness’ similar to the effect of a roller coaster.

As well as lifelike graphics, realistic terrain and sound effects, small details - such as engines overheating if left idle for too long - are played out:

The level of detail is fantastic,” said Major Edward Whishaw of the Corps of Royal Engineers, in charge of the £330m facility, which boasts one the largest air-conditioning units in the world to prevent the mass of computer equipment from overheating.

We used to have stick men running around on screen, but now we have game-quality features with 3D lifelike human figures,” he continued.

It’s a modern gaming environment that, hopefully, a young 18- or 19-year-old soldier will appreciate; replicating theatre with a carbon copy of reality, and getting vehicle crews and multiples to come together and train.

It doesn’t replace the real thing, but it complements it by making sure troops are prepared to get the most out of field exercises that follow.

248 Gurkha Signal Squadron is equipped with NATO’s advanced Richelieu digital communications systems, primarily used to support the NATO ARRC (Allied Rapid Reaction Corps) Headquarters.

Lieutenant Alex Cave, Officer in Charge of the 248 Gurkha Signal Squadron detachment at Gioia del Colle, explained:

We are working in support of the RAF; the RAF provide the majority of the communications systems through the Tactical Communications Wing, but because this is a NATO-led operation, NATO personnel based at Headquarters in Poggio use a unique NATO communications network which is something the RAF do not usually cater for; that’s where we fill the gap.

Personnel based at Gioia del Colle and Trapani receive Air Tasking Orders (ATOs) containing classified information from the Command Allied Operations Centre based in Poggio.

248 Gurkha Signal Squadron personnel ensure the ATOs are received by those that need them, facilitating the free flow of essential ‘comms’. The Gurkha signallers’ skills, kit and experience - gathered over more than 60 years in the British Army - allow for a highly focused and efficient operation.

Sergeant Lalit, second-in-command of the detachment, said:

We’re here to do a job; our training ensures that we’re very focused on the task and we just get on with what we need to do.

Working with the RAF is a great privilege for us, and we’re enjoying working together in a friendly environment.

One of the soldiers from the squadron in Italy at the moment is Lance Corporal Agnesh Rai who joined the British Army in 2005. Like many young men growing up in Nepal, he had always wanted to join the Gurkhas, and relishes the opportunities it presents:

I wanted to see the world and maintain my family tradition, as my uncle was in the Gurkhas too,” he said. “It’s adventurous, I get to deploy to lots of different places, meet different people and keep fit.

It is intended to teach Muslims about patience, spirituality, humility and submissiveness to God.

Ramadan is also a time when Muslims take time out from worldly affairs and focus on self-reformation, spiritual cleansing and enlightenment, and they are encouraged to pray more often than normal.

During Ramadan therefore soldiers from the ANA go out on patrol in temperatures approaching 50 degrees Celsius without eating or drinking anything during the entire day.

The warriors of the 1st Tolay (Company) based at Patrol Base 4 in Nahr-e Saraj, Helmand province, undertake their patrols helped and advised along the way by their British Army partners.

Captain George Duffield, 9th/12th Royal Lancers, is the Officer Commanding the 1st Tolay Advisory Team:

The ANA made the decision that they would continue to patrol and train throughout Ramadan despite the added hardship of their fasting during daylight hours,” he said. “They have remained focused and continue to work hard, which has been very impressive.

After they have completed their morning patrols, the warriors of the 1st Tolay throw themselves into a training programme aimed at increasing their all-round military skills.

The training is organised by the ANA advisors from B Squadron, 9th/12th Royal Lancers, who are deployed with other 7th Armoured Brigade units on Operation HERRICK 14 as part of Task Force Helmand.

The Tolay Advisory Training Team (TATT) works with the ANA on a daily basis and focuses on long term ANA development; ensuring systems, processes and operational planning are in place for when they will take on sole responsibility for security. Members of the TATT patrol every day with the ANA and monitor their development and self-sufficiency while taking part in operations to secure the local areas.

The training programme qualifies the Afghan troops in five key military disciplines: counter-improvised explosive device training, navigation, battlefield first aid, weapon handling and patrolling skills.

Captain Duffield says these are the basic skills needed for soldiering:

The training which we are delivering will develop the Tolay to a stage where they will be able to start conducting their own lessons and pass the knowledge amongst themselves - like us they see it as a key capability.

The training takes place during the relative cool of the morning and is a mixture of lectures and hands-on practice. It can be slow as everything has to be translated through an interpreter, often into the two official languages - Pashto and Dari. Yet the warriors all appear to enjoy themselves and are always keen to learn.

Sergeant Ajmal is serving with the1st Tolay:

We like the lessons as we are learning so much,” he said. “It is hard for us as it is Ramadan, but we know how important it is.

Given the high temperatures and harsh conditions, the lessons are kept short so the warriors are able to concentrate.

Warrant Officer Class 2 Nick Galley is another of the advisors from 9th/12th Royal Lancers. He is Second-in-Command of the TATT:

We have to get the balance right between ensuring that we impart as much knowledge as possible with the limitations of Ramadan in mind,” he said. “They know that the lessons may save their life, so they are really determined to pay attention.

The non-commissioned officers who perform the best during their training will be chosen for an instructor cadre which will develop them as subject matter experts. This ensures that in the future the valuable skills will be taught to Afghans by Afghans.",Home Secretary visit to Northampton,Other,,id25_1006

It was a strange experience for most of the young soldiers - it’s not often you deploy on a foot patrol only to find yourself playing with kites and entertaining the local children!

Lieutenant Erik Smith added:

This was a fantastic sight and real evidence of progress in Helmand province. Sights like this are becoming increasingly common and, as the confidence of people and communities gets stronger, there is nothing the insurgents can do about it.

Clearly his formidable training ethic has paid dividends as last week he was named in Britain’s 14-strong Olympic judo squad in the men’s +100kg category.

Describing his joy at making his Olympics debut, Marine Sherrington said:

It is a real relief to be honest because I feel like I’ve been waiting a long time to hear about whether or not I have been selected. I now know which direction I’m going in and I have a goal that I’ll be aiming for.

This is my first Olympics and I am really honoured to have qualified. It’s a double honour because not only am I representing my country but also the Royal Navy and the Royal Marines who have been hugely supportive of my training and have helped me get where I am today.

It’s a cliche that an athlete lives, eats and dreams sport, but in Marine Sherrington’s case this is illustrated to a tee as he laughingly recounts the night that he unwittingly pinned wife Zoe in a headlock in his sleep, dreaming that he was fighting.

Luckily, Zoe behaved just like any opponent staring defeat in the face and meekly tapped his arm in submission. Moments later, he leaned over muttering:

Did I win?

The Marine was just 10 years old when he first tried judo:

Mum and dad used to make us go so they could grab time for themselves every Friday night,” said Marine Sherrington.

But two years later he quit and switched to rugby union, sticking with it until his late teens.

Marine Sherrington joined the Marines in 2000 and it was after a deployment to Iraq that he felt inspired to return to judo as an outlet for his surplus energy. Racing through his green, brown and the coveted black belts in 12 breakneck months, he began to compete a year later at the relatively advanced age of 22:

I wanted to see how far I could make it and within six months I was number three in Britain.

Judo has taken him all over the world to Europe, Russia, Japan, New Zealand, Samoa, America, Canada and Belarus, but he sees little of the exotic cities he competes in:

I turn up on the Friday, get to my hotel, weigh in, sleep, fight Saturday and fly home Monday. I get a stamp on my passport but that’s about it,” he said.

A Marine through-and-through, 21-stone (133kg) of solid muscle and six-foot-five (1.95m), Marine Sherrington credits the physical conditioning of his beloved Marines for instilling him with tip-top fitness and a never-say-die belief.

He needed it too. Although ranked Britain’s heavyweight number one judo champ back in the spring, Marine Sherrington’s top-dog status belied a labyrinthine points system that left him ranked 54th in the world, which meant that Olympic selection went right to the wire:

You can be number one in Britain but not even be ranked in the world,” explained Marine Sherrington.

Judo is very tough. It’s one of those sports that you’ve got to hang in at, as long as your body can physically take it.

The last few years have been hard physically. In 2009, he was beset with crippling shoulder, ankle and knee injuries resulting in four major operations that could have ended his career. But he stuck with it and his unswerving Bootneck conviction means that few would bet against him coming out on top against the best in London 2012.

Coming from a minnow sport, Marine Sherrington knows that judo lacks the razzmatazz of many spectator sports.

Despite taking two British Open golds, he clearly doesn’t envy the global fame of footballers Gerrard, Rooney and Terry, though he’s something of a novelty on the circuit for sporting his cherished Green Beret whenever he clambers up onto the winner’s podium.

In top-level sport, sacrifices come thick and fast. Like most athletes, Marine Sherrington doesn’t drink or has even enjoyed a holiday in six years:

To be successful in judo, I have to focus because it is just so tough,” said the Marine.

Even his 2011 marriage to Zoe was squeezed in before a fight in Estonia 48 hours after the ceremony:

Zoe knows the score and how much I’ve put into it,” he said. “In the past, I’ve been broken and snapped. I’ve had to rest; you can never plan what’s going to happen.

On the tantalising prospect of Olympic glory in London 2012 Marine Sherrington said:

It is hard to say who I’ll be watching out for because we’re talking about the top 24 guys in the world - it is a complete luck of the draw in the way the fights will be marked up so I’m just concentrating on my training at the moment.

Although physical exercise is a massive part of being a Marine it is very different to what I do now because it is so controlled and judo is very technical. We can’t just use our muscle to move people around - it is all about technique and style.

Marine Sherrington is the polar opposite of a showboater who’s long lost count of his medal haul:

A lot of people fall out with me over this,” he admitted.

When he ran out of space at home, he gave his medals to his mum but, faced with the prospect of building an extension, she handed them back:

To be honest, they all started going in the bin,” he said.

You’ve got to remember, I’m a Marine,” he added. “I don’t consider myself a judo player. I’m just playing in someone else’s yard at the moment and the only medals I’m interested in are the best.

Asked if that elusive gold medal seeps into his brain the moment he wakens, Marine Sherrington pauses:

When I first went into judo, the typical Marine thinking is ‘I can do anything, I can win anything’. Then reality hits because, until you’ve done at least six years of judo at international level, you’re not going to win.

For the first four years on the international scene I went out first fight. Slowly, you win one… two… then you go out again. You go in another competition and win one, then win two. Then, all of a sudden, it all comes together as it did for me in Samoa and you win five fights and take gold.

Marine Sherrington’s career highlight to date was at the Samoa World Cup when he won gold for Britain:

Put it this way, very few people win a gold medal at the World Cup,” said Marine Sherrington with justifiable pride. “I will be putting that one in a frame on the wall.

Many will be hoping that come London 2012 Marine Sherrington may just have to clear a bit more space in the trophy cabinet.

They are the leading route proving and clearance squadron and their job is to travel across the UK’s area of operations in their Mastiff armoured vehicles to make sure routes are safe from IEDs and bombs.

On one of their many patrols recently, the team were clearing one of the main routes through Helmand when their vehicle struck an IED. Sapper Gareth Addy said immediately they knew what it was:

There was a massive explosion that seriously rocked the vehicle. It was the biggest I’ve ever experienced. Immediately afterwards it went very quiet and then you start to realise what’s happened and worry if everyone is OK.

The team quickly began their drills to assess the situation and check whether there were any injuries. Despite the size of the bomb and the force of the blast, none of the people in the Mastiff were hurt.

The vehicle sustained some damage, but, thanks to the armour and design of the Mastiff, it was only minor, and after a further assessment by the team of the route, the patrol continued with their journey.

Sapper Addy, aged 31 from Bridlington, who is a Mastiff driver and gunner, said it was only when they returned to Camp Bastion some hours later they realised how lucky they had been:

The vehicles we use really do work and everyone now knows that, should the worst happen, they will do a good job of protecting us. In a strange way, that incident increased everyone’s morale and confidence for the remainder of the tour.

The Mastiff is a heavily armoured, 6x6 wheel-drive protected patrol vehicle which carries eight people, plus two crew. It is used in Afghanistan to transport troops and protect large convoys as well as directly engaging the Taliban with its advanced weapons systems.

Although heavily armoured, these wheeled patrol vehicles have a less intimidating profile than tracked vehicles and give commanders on the ground in Afghanistan more options to deal with the threats they are facing.

Part of the Mastiff’s resilience towards mine explosions comes from the fact that its hull is V-shaped, as opposed to flat, which pushes the force of any explosion outwards.

During Operation HERRICK 14, the engineers from 31 AES have played an important part in enabling both troops and locals to move more freely from one area to another and with greater confidence in their security.

Sergeant Matthew Jones, aged 32, is one of 42 soldiers from the unit that will deploy. This will be his second tour of Afghanistan. The unit last deployed to Afghanistan in 2008. He said:

We have been completely focused on pre-deployment training since January. It has been a steady and methodical build up and we are all now just wanting to get there and get on with the job.

Private Sarah Smith, aged 23, will deploy with Eddie, a black Labrador, as part of the Arms Explosive Search (AES) Team. All AES dogs are trained to indicate the presence of arms and explosives in everything from buildings and compounds to all types of vehicles.

This will be Private Smith’s second tour of Afghanistan. Although they won’t know their exact location until arrival in Afghanistan, she expects to deploy on the front line working with the infantry units:

Eddie is a cheeky but loveable dog and he chews everything at the moment, but he is still young, he is only two years old,” she said.

Fellow dog handler Private Joseph Cant, aged 23, will deploy with Fizz, a yellow Labrador. The duo will be responsible for searching vehicles that come into one of the main Army bases which include Camp Bastion, Lashkar Gah and Kandahar. He said:

The dog has to trust you as much as you trust him. It’s all about building a relationship. Fizz is soppy and affectionate and a very good worker. She has a real drive to work and is a good, independent dog. She knows when it’s time to work.

When the dogs first arrive in Afghanistan the first task will be to get them acclimatised to the environment, just like the soldiers themselves.

At Camp Bastion the dogs are housed in air-conditioned kennels which also have heating for the colder winter nights and each dog has a run area and covered sleeping area in their individual kennel. When based out of forward operating bases, the dogs will sleep with their handlers.

With a dog’s sense of smell being approximately 42 times stronger than a human’s it’s dogs like Eddie and Fizz that are ideal for searching for improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Earlier this year a Belgian Shepherd dog called Chocolat discovered a Taliban production line for IEDs. See Related News.

The Officer Commanding 104 Military Working Dog Squadron, Major Steve Leavis, said:

I am proud of every single soldier. For some of them this will be their first operational tour and of course it will be very hard indeed. They are away from home, they have left their families behind, and they are working and living in tough environments. But they are all in good spirits and all are looking forward to the challenges that lie ahead.

They will do a good job, there is no doubt about it, they are first rate professional soldiers as well as dedicated handlers.

The dogs are recruited at between one and three years old, and most are unwanted pets. They are trained at the Defence Animal Centre in Melton Mowbray.

These additional personnel will enable the UK to build on the work already being undertaken to support and advise the National Transitional Council (NTC) on how to better protect civilians.

In particular, they will advise the NTC on how to improve their military organisational structures, communications and logistics. In doing so, the UK will coordinate closely with other international partners also assisting the NTC.

In a statement, Mr Hague said:

This deployment is fully within the terms of UNSCR [United Nations Security Council Resolution] 1973 both in respect of civilian protection and its provision expressly ruling out a foreign occupation force on Libyan soil.

Consistent with our obligations under that Resolution, our officers will not be involved in training or arming the opposition’s fighting forces, nor will they be involved in the planning or execution of the NTC’s military operations or in the provision of any other form of operational military advice.

Mr Hague said the UK regards the NTC as legitimate political interlocutors for the UK and in recent weeks the British government has decided to supply the NTC with non-lethal assistance in order to assist them in protecting civilians, including telecommunications equipment and protective body armour.

Separately, Major General John Lorimer, Strategic Communications Officer to the Chief of Defence Staff, has delivered an update on UK military action as part of the NATO mission in support of UNSCR 1973.

Major General Lorimer said that NATO has maintained a high tempo of operational activity under Operation Unified Protector, and allied air patrols have continued their regular armed reconnaissance missions, and attacked a number of regime targets.

On Monday, 18 April, a Tornado and Typhoon attacked a pair of multiple rocket launcher vehicles and a light artillery piece which had been observed firing on Misurata, then guided in a second pair of RAF aircraft to destroy a self-propelled gun and tank which were being brought into the area on a tank transporter.

However, he said that it has also been clear that more needed to be done to inhibit Colonel Gaddafi’s strategic ability to direct his armed forces and their continued atrocities against large sections of the Libyan people.

A carefully planned strike was launched by NATO over the past two nights against a number of command and control facilities across Libya, which had been identified as playing a key role in the coordination of the movement of Colonel Gaddafi’s forces,” Maj Gen Lorimer said.

As part of this operation, a number of Tomahawk missiles were fired by HMS Triumph in the early hours of Monday morning. These were synchronised with precision strikes by coalition aircraft, including Tornados and Typhoons. A further salvo of Tomahawk missiles was launched by Triumph at additional command and control sites last night.

The General said it will take time for the full impact of these attacks to become clear, but that:

… they do illustrate, in the clearest manner, NATO’s resolution to take all necessary action to safeguard, wherever possible, the Libyan people under threat of attack, and its ability to strike, with sophisticated targeting and effective precision firepower, at the heart of the apparatus used by Colonel Gaddafi to terrorise the civilian population.",Focused inspections,Administrative,,id25_1012

Report by Captain Mike Billings.,Ministry of Defence,2 June 2011,"A four-man team from the French Army’s 1st Logistic Brigade spent a week attached to the British Army’s 102 Logistic Brigade at their barracks in Gutersloh as part of Exercise Pre-Flandres, building up to the main Exercise Flandres 2011 which will take place at Mailly-le-Camp in France later this month.

The exercise will provide an important opportunity for British and French Armed Forces personnel to work together and for military logisticians from both countries to improve their joint communications capabilities.

Lieutenant Colonel Nigel Rhodes, Chief of Staff of 102 Logistic Brigade, said:

The aim of Exercise Flandres is to demonstrate interoperability between France and the UK - our ability to work together on a professional and personal basis is key.

While we will be working together using English we will however use French planning processes and procedures.

“Exercise Pre-Flandres is the last in a series of exercises designed to prepare us to do this and I am happy to say that we have built a strong relationship with our allies in the French 1st Logistic Brigade.”

Exercise Pre-Flandres was one of the first steps to bring to reality a 2008 agreement between Britain and France. The Anglo-French Summit of November 2010 gave fresh impetus to this co-operation.

The two Armies have directed the implementation of a brigade partnership that will see a unity of effort and equipment which includes the eventual creation of a Combined Joint Expeditionary Force - resulting in a greater level of security for both nations.

Major Philippe Paul, from the French Army’s 1st Logistic Brigade, said:

It has been very interesting working with the British during this exercise and we will learn a lot from sharing skills and knowledge in this way. It makes sense as neighbouring countries to be working together making best use of equipment and defence resources.

Corporal Cas Castellari, who serves with 102 Logistic Brigade, added:

It has been interesting working with the French and seeing what equipment they use for their communications and IT. I am looking forward to the main Exercise Flandres in France and the opportunity to be able to see the planning process through from start to finish as part of a binational headquarters.",UK Investment Support Directory,Informational,Other,id25_1013

It follows a letter which appeared in The Times earlier this week from a group of former Navy chiefs who called for the decisions on the future of Harrier and HMS Ark Royal to be reversed.

Here follows the Chiefs of Staff letter published today:

There has been a wide range of comment surrounding the military capabilities affected by the decisions taken as a result of the Strategic Defence and Security Review.

This commentary has addressed aspects of capability across the full spectrum of land, sea and air. Most recently we have seen views expressed by senior retired naval officers who set out their concerns in your newspaper yesterday [10 Nov] asking that the decision to remove Harrier from service be reversed.

No-one would pretend that the SDSR has been painless. It has led to a range of decisions that we would not have otherwise chosen to make. But the financial constraints the Department faced meant that it would have been irresponsible to try to avoid them.",Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS),Welfare,Monetary,id25_1014

In Thurrock, Ofsted’s main concern centres on the low proportion of good or outstanding primary schools, which is well below the average for local authorities in the East of England and indeed all authorities nationally.

Six primary schools and one secondary were inspected during the focused period 24–28 February. The schools were all due for inspection by the end of this academic year.

During the inspections, Ofsted also gathered information on the use, quality and impact of Thurrock Local Authority’s support for school improvement by asking three additional key questions of headteachers and governors.

1018,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-system-for-international-travel,News story,New system for international travel,Eight countries will move from the red list on 22 September and the rules for international travel to England will change on 4 October 2021.,"Department for Transport, Department of Health and Social Care, The Rt Hon Sajid Javid and The Rt Hon Grant Shapps",17 September 2021,"Read the rules for travel to England from 4 October 2021.

The Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, has today (17 September 2021) announced a simplified system for international travel in light of the success of theUK’s domestic vaccine rollout, providing greater stability for industry and passengers.

The current traffic light system will be replaced by a single red list of countries and territories which will continue to be crucial in order to protect public health, and simplified travel measures for arrivals from the rest of the world from Monday 4 October at 4am.

Testing requirements will also be reduced for eligible fully vaccinated travellers, who will no longer need to take aPDTwhen travelling to England from Monday 4 October 4am.

From the end of October, eligible fully vaccinated passengers and those with an approved vaccine from a select group of non-red countries will be able to replace their day 2 test with a cheaper lateral flow test, reducing the cost of tests on arrival into England. The government wants to introduce this by the end of October, aiming to have it in place for when people return from half-term breaks.

Anyone testing positive will need to isolate and take a confirmatoryPCRtest, at no additional cost to the traveller, which would be genomically sequenced to help identify new variants.

Testing for unvaccinated passengers from non-red countries will include pre-departure tests, day 2 and day 8PCRtests.Test to releaseremains an option to reduce self-isolation period.

From 4 October, England will welcomefully vaccinated travellers from a host of new countries– who will be treated like returning fully vaccinatedUKtravellers – including 17 countries and territories such as Japan and Singapore, following the success of an existing pilot with theUSand Europe.

Grant Shapps Transport Secretary said:

Today’s changes mean a simpler, more straightforward system. One with less testing and lower costs, allowing more people to travel, see loved ones or conduct business around the world while providing a boost for the travel industry.

Public health has always been at the heart of our international travel policy and with more than 8 in 10 adults vaccinated in theUK, we are now able to introduce a proportionate updated structure that reflects the new landscape.

Part of the third Global Travel Taskforce checkpoint review, today’s update reiterates the government’s focus on protecting its borders from the most dangerous variants and ensures continuity for industry and passengers the remainder of the year. We will look to set out a further review for theUK’s international travel policy early in the new year to provide further certainty for the spring and summer 2022 seasons.

Conducting the final regular traffic light review before the switch to the new two-tiered system, several additional countries and territories will move off thered list– Turkey, Pakistan, the Maldives, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Oman, Bangladesh and Kenya. Changes will come into effect at 4am Wednesday 22 September.

Passengers who aren’t recognised as being fully vaccinated with authorised vaccines and certificates under England’s international travel rules, will still have to take apre-departure test, aday 2 and day 8PCRtestand self-isolate for 10 days upon their return from a non-red list country under the new two-tiered travel programme.Test to Releasewill remain an option for unvaccinated passengers who wish to shorten their isolation period.

Sajid Javid Health and Social Care Secretary said:

Today we have simplified the travel rules to make them easier to understand and follow, opening up tourism and reducing the costs to go abroad.

As global vaccination efforts continue to accelerate and more people gain protection from this dreadful disease, it is right that our rules and regulations keep pace.

From late October, we will also be making changes to allow passengers who change flights or international trains during their journey to follow the measures associated to their country of departure, rather than any countries they have transited through as part of their journey.

All passengers will still need to fill in apassenger locator formahead of travel. Passengers should continue to check GOV.UKtravel guidance includingFCDOtravel advicebefore, during and after travel to keep up to date in entry requirements and ensure compliance with the latest COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 regulations for the country being visited.",,,,id25_1018
