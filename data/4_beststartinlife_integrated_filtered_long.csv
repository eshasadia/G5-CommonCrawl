we’re always looking to improve the accessibility of this website. if you find any problems not listed on this page or think we’re not meeting accessibility requirements, contact: admin@bigbluedoor.net.
enforcement procedure
the equality and human rights commission (ehrc) is responsible for enforcing the public sector bodies (websites and mobile applications) (no. 2) accessibility regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). if you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the equality advisory and support service (eass).
technical information about this website’s accessibility
childcare choices is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the public sector bodies (websites and mobile applications) (no. 2) accessibility regulations 2018.
compliance status
this website is partially compliant with the web content accessibility guidelines version 2.2 aa standard, due to the 'exemptions’ listed below.
non-accessible content
disproportionate burden
we have developed a range of communications tools to help childcare providers promote 30 hours and tax-free childcare. these consist of pdfs and images purely for childcare providers, and not essential for the general public.
we’ve assessed the cost of fixing the accessibility issues with pdfs. we believe that doing so now would be a disproportionate burden within the meaning of the accessibility regulations.
what we’re doing to improve accessibility
any new pdfs we publish will meet accessibility standards.

15 and 30 hours - frequently asked questions
what entitlements are available and which ones might i be able to use?
there are several different entitlements available for parents in england, which have different eligibility criteria. these are set out below.
entitlement
child’s
age
eligibility
what you can
receive
how to apply
working
parents
entitlement
from the
term
after they
turn 9
months
until they
start
school read more on eligibility for the working parent entitlement. 30 hours per week
over 38 weeks of the
year. you apply online on gov.uk.
for parents of
2-year-olds
receiving
some
additional
forms of
support
from the
term
after they
turn 2 years old read more on eligibility for this entitlement. 15 hours per week
over 38 weeks of the
year. contact your childcare provider or your local council to apply for this scheme.
universal
entitlement
for all 3 and 4-year-olds
from the
term
after they
turn 3
years old
through
to
starting
school all 3 and 4-year-olds
are eligible. 15 hours per week
over 38 weeks of the
year.
can be combined
with the working
parents entitlement
to make up 30
hours. speak to your chosen
childcare provider
about if they can offer
a place, and take them
your child’s birth
certificate.
your provider may agree to ‘stretch’ your entitlement by using fewer hours over more than 38 weeks per year. check with your childcare provider to find out if this is something they offer.
it is not possible to use more than 30 hours in a week, but you don’t have to use your full entitlement if you don’t want to.
when can i use the entitlements from?
you can start using your entitlements from the term after your child turns the relevant age to use that entitlement. the relevant age for the working parent entitlement is 9 months old.
when your child turns the relevant age
when they can get their hours from
1 january to 31 march
term starting on or after 1 april
1 april to 31 august
term starting on or after 1 september
1 september to 31 december
term starting on or after 1 january
you are only able to claim the entitlements from the term after they become the relevant age because this gives local authorities and childcare providers enough time to prepare. for the working parent entitlement, if you are not eligible to apply in the term your child reaches the relevant age, you will need to wait until the following term to make an application.
how do i apply for the working parents entitlement?
you can apply online at gov.uk.
you’ll need to make sure you have the following information to hand before starting the application:
your national insurance number (or unique taxpayer reference if you are self employed)
the date you started or are due to start work
details of any government support or benefits you receive
the uk birth certificate reference number (if you have one) for your child
if you are a foster carer, there is a separate application process. speak to your social worker to find out more.
when do i need to apply?
we recommend you contact your chosen provider as early as possible to secure your place.
you will be able to take up your hours from the term after you meet all the eligibility criteria for the entitlement you are applying for. these terms begin on 1 january, 1 april and 1 september.
you can apply for your code up to 16 weeks before your baby turns 9 months old. you need to apply online before the deadline to receive a code to give to your childcare provider. the deadline is the day before the new term begins, but we encourage you to apply earlier, and recommend applying at least 6 weeks before the deadline. some providers may ask for codes before the deadline, so we recommend you speak to your provider to find out if this is the case. the deadlines are:
when you would like to use your
entitlements from
the deadline to apply for a code
1 january 31 december
1 april 31 march
1 september 31 august
if you do not apply on or before the deadline, you will not be able to take up your entitlements in that term.
when will i find out if i am eligible?
when you apply you may find out if you’re eligible straight away, but it can take longer if you need to provide further information. once your application has been approved, you’ll get a code to give to your childcare provider.
what happens once i receive my code?
you’ll need to give the code to your childcare provider, along with your national insurance number and your child’s date of birth.
your childcare provider will check the code and then allocate your child a place if available.
we recommend parents speak with their chosen provider about when they will be able to offer them a place.
we know that some providers are able to amend invoices if they have issued them before a parent has received their code, so we recommend you speak to your provider if you are in this situation.
once you have received your code, you will need to reconfirm every 3 months even if you have not yet started using your entitlements.
what are the eligibility criteria i need to meet to claim the 30 hours childcare for working parents?
working parents in england who each earn the equivalent of at least 16 hours per week at the national minimum wage are eligible.
you’re eligible if you earn at least:
your age
yearly
3 months
weekly
21 and over
£10,158 £2,539.68 £195.36
18 to 20
£8,320 £2,080 £160
under 18 or an
apprentice
£6,281 £1,570.40 £120.80
you can earn up to £100,000 adjusted net income per year and be eligible. if you have a partner who lives with you, they must also earn between these two amounts. the £100,000 adjusted net income level was chosen to correspond with income tax thresholds. see our eligibility criteria for more information, including the income requirements for those who are self-employed.
how is my eligibility calculated?
eligibility is calculated on an individual basis rather than by household. this means if you have a partner who lives with you, you must both individually earn between these two amounts. however, if you are in a couple and one person is claiming one of the following benefits, you may still be eligible:
carer’s allowance
incapacity benefit
severe disablement allowance
contribution-based employment and support allowance or
certain additional elements of universal credit
can i apply for a code whilst i am on maternity, paternity or adoption leave?
if you are applying for childcare for an older child, who is not the subject of the parental leave, you can apply as normal.
you can also apply for the child that is the subject of the parental leave, though when you return to work will affect when you can take up the childcare. the dates below apply:
date of starting or returning
work
when you can apply from
when you can access
your entitlements from
1 october to 31 january 1 september to 31 december 1 january
1 february to 30 april 1 january to 31 march 1 april
1 may to 30 september 1 april to 31 august 1 september
if i’m eligible for universal credit can i get the working parents entitlements?
yes, if you meet the eligibility criteria. whilst you cannot claim universal credit and tax-free childcare at the same time, those on universal credit will still be able to claim the working parents entitlement, as long as they meet the eligibility criteria.
this will not affect your ability to claim universal credit. if you are taking up additional childcare (on top of your 30 hours entitlement), you can claim universal credit childcare, which can support you with up to 85% of the cost of additional childcare you pay for outside your entitlement to 30 hours. please see the universal credit childcare costs page for more information.
alternatively, there is a separate entitlement which means that parents of 2-year-olds who are already receiving some additional forms of support, such as universal credit, can receive 15 hours of early education. this is separate from the entitlement for working parents.
all parents regardless of employment status, family circumstances, or income levels are eligible for the universal 15 hours for 3 and 4-year-olds.
how often do i need to log into my childcare account?
you need to log into your childcare account every 3 months to reconfirm that your details are up to date and that you remain eligible for the childcare entitlements for working parents and/or tax-free childcare.
will i be reminded to reconfirm my details?
yes, you will receive a reminder:
the first email reminder is sent 4 weeks before reconfirmation is due
a further reminder is sent 2 weeks before reconfirmation is due
a notification is sent on the deadline date of reconfirmation to notify you that your eligibility for funded childcare for working parents has stopped and asking you to confirm your details as soon as possible
this message will come from gov.uk. please remember to make sure that your details are up to date.
how long does reconfirmation usually take?
in most cases, reconfirmation should only take a few minutes, but it may take longer if you need to provide further information.
how do i log into my childcare account to reconfirm?
you need to log into your childcare account on gov.uk using your government gateway id to reconfirm. the dates between which you should reconfirm will be displayed when you log in.
what happened in september 2025?
september 2025 marked the final phase of the childcare expansion, meaning eligible working parents can now claim 30 hours of childcare all the way through from the term after their child turns 9 months until school age.
what if the provider i want to use says they don’t have a place available?
if your chosen provider doesn’t have a place available, we advise that you explore other providers in your local area.
your local authority can provide support with finding a childcare provider in your area.
what if i am a foster carer?
children in foster care who are aged 9 months to 4-years-old could also be eligible for the working parent entitlements, provided the foster parent is in paid work outside their fostering role and does not expect their adjusted net income to exceed £100,000.
there is no minimum income requirement for foster parents, however the local authority responsible for the child must confirm it is satisfied that the foster parent’s paid work other than their fostering role is consistent with the child’s care plan.
foster parents cannot use the online childcare service application to get funded childcare. speak to your social worker and your local council if you want to apply.
what if i am a student?
students who work in addition to studying are eligible for this entitlement if they meet the income requirements.
students who do not work are not eligible, but other schemes are available for those in further or higher education. if you’re a full-time student, you may be eligible for help with your childcare costs. you can find further information about help with childcare while you study on gov.uk.
i missed out on the working parent entitlement because of a computer glitch
if you are eligible for the working parents entitlement but were unable to take up a place in time due to a technical issue with your application. you may be eligible for compensation if, for example:
you applied before the deadline but your code has a start which is on or after the start of the term
you were unable to reconfirm your eligibility due to a system error
what are the immigration requirements for parents?
you must have a national insurance number to apply. if you have a partner who lives with you, they must also have a national insurance number. if you are the parent who is making the application you must have at least one of the following:
british or irish citizenship
settled or pre-settled status, or you have applied and you’re waiting for a decision
permission to access public funds – your uk residence card will tell you if you can’t do this
what if i’m disabled, claim personal independence payments or have caring responsibilities?
if you or your partner is unable to work because you get one of the following benefits, you could still be eligible for the working parent entitlement as long as you have a partner who is working and meets the eligibility criteria:
carer’s allowance
incapacity benefit
severe disablement allowance
contribution-based employment and support allowance or
certain additional elements of universal credit
however, if you are a single parent on one of these benefits you will also need to be working and meet the income requirements to be eligible for the working parent entitlement.
claiming disability living allowance or personal independence payment for yourself or your child does not automatically grant you eligibility to use this entitlement. you would still need to be working and meet the income requirements in order to claim it.
however, parents who are already receiving some additional forms of support can receive 15 hours early learning for 2-year-olds. this is separate from the entitlement for working parents and is available to parents whose child is entitled to disability living allowance. all parents regardless of employment status or income levels are eligible for 15 hours for 3 and 4-year-olds.
what do the entitlements cover?
government funding is intended to pay for 15 or 30 hours a week of high quality, flexible childcare. the 15 or 30 hours must be able to be accessed free of charge to parents.
government funding does not cover
meals
nappies
additional hours
additional activities, such as trips
so you might be asked to pay for these things. however, these charges must not be mandatory, or a condition of accessing a funded place and you can speak to your provider about what alternative options they may have.
what if i wish to start using them later, or if my child is already older than 9 months?
if you wish to use your entitlements later than the term after your child turns the relevant age, then you can apply closer to the time you wish to start. provided you still meet the eligibility criteria for that entitlement at that time, you will not lose your ability to apply.
can i use the entitlements for a nanny?
no, you are not able to use the entitlements for a nanny or a home carer.
can i use the entitlements for childcare with a relative?
no. you cannot use the entitlements for childcare provided by a relative, such as a grandparent.
can i add another child to my account between reconfirmation windows?
yes, a parent who is already using the childcare service for another child can add a new child to their account at any time.
what happens if i miss my reconfirmation window?
if you miss your reconfirmation window, your eligibility for tax-free childcare and/or your childcare entitlements will lapse. however, if your child already has a place where they're accessing their entitlement, a grace period will apply. this means your child can continue in their place for a short time, but you need to submit another application as soon as you can to keep getting the childcare entitlements and/or tax-free childcare.
what happens if my circumstances change and i no longer meet the eligibility criteria?
if your child is already in a place, a grace period for your childcare entitlement will apply. this means your child can continue in their place for a short time, but you need to reconfirm your eligibility during this period as soon as you can to keep getting the childcare entitlements and/or tax-free childcare.
if your child is aged 2-3 years old and you or your child receive some additional forms of support, you may be eligible for 15 hours early learning for 2-year-olds under a separate scheme and you should speak to your local authority and/or provider in the first instance.
when can i submit a new application if i missed my reconfirmation window or fell out of eligibility?
you can submit a new application any time you meet the eligibility criteria for childcare entitlements or tax-free childcare. you must then present your code to your provider to confirm your place can continue.
what is the entitlement for parents already receiving some additional forms of support?
parents of 2-year-olds who are already receiving some additional forms of support may be eligible for 15 hours early learning for their child. this is separate to the 30 hours for working parents. speak to your local council about funded childcare places for eligible 2-year-olds. you should be able to find advice online on your local authority’s website.
if you’re not eligible for 15 hours early learning for families receiving additional forms of support, you may be able to get childcare if you’re working under a separate scheme.
if you meet both sets of eligibility criteria, you should still apply for the working parent entitlement, but you will receive 15 hours from each scheme (up to a maximum of 30 hours in total).
some households that have no recourse to public funds may be eligible for this entitlement for their 2 year old.
if your child is in receipt of 15 hours of early learning for families receiving some additional forms of support, you may also be eligible for early years pupil premium (eypp). eypp is paid to childcare providers and gives them additional funding to support learning and development for children. you can see if you’re eligible for eypp on gov.uk and speak with your provider or local council to apply.
who can get 15 hours for 3 to 4 year olds?
all 3 and 4-year-olds who live in england are entitled to 15 hours childcare a week, over 38 weeks a year the year, irrespective of income levels, benefit status, or family circumstances.
you can choose to take fewer hours over more weeks, if your childcare provider offers this option.
when can i access 15 hours for my 3 year old?
you can get it from the 1 january, 1 april or 1 september after your child’s 3rd birthday.
contact your childcare provider or local council to find out more.
how do i apply for this entitlement?
take your child’s birth certificate and speak to your chosen provider.
if your child is already accessing the 15 hours funded childcare for working parents from 9 months up to 3 years old and your child will turn 3 before 31 august 2025, your child will automatically be moved onto 30 hours from 1 september, providing you remain eligible.
just reconfirm your code as normal and it will become usable to claim 30 hours from 1 september 2025. the actual code will remain the same. you should also speak to your childcare provider to let them know you intend to take up 30 hours.
what other support is available?
you can also apply for tax-free childcare or universal credit childcare. you cannot use both of these at the same time.
you may be able to use these other forms of support to help pay for childcare that is not covered through the entitlements. for example, you can use it to help pay for any additional hours, or to pay for a nanny if your nanny has registered on the voluntary part of the general childcare register. it can also be used to pay for certain additional services that are charged by your provider.
is there any support i can get for my provider to help my child?
yes. the early years pupil premium is additional funding for your provider to support children whose families get certain benefits. its purpose is to enhance learning and development support for children, ultimately improving their outcomes. you can find out more about this on gov.uk at get extra funding for your early years provider.
is there any support for my provider to help my disabled child?
yes. disability access funding is a grant given each year to providers to help children with disabilities get the best support during their early education. if you get disability living allowance for your child, then they are eligible for this funding. if you think your child may be eligible for disability access funding speak to your childcare provider or local council.

apply for 30 hours childcare
contact your preferred provider
it’s a good idea to contact your preferred childcare provider as early as possible to secure your place. if you’re not sure, you can enter your postcode on gov.uk to help find childcare providers in your area. once you have found your preferred provider, you can begin the application process. the deadline to apply will depend on when you will need childcare to start.
find your application deadline
you can apply for your code up to 16 weeks before your baby turns 9 months old.
you need to apply online before the deadline to receive a code to give to your childcare provider. the deadline is the day before the new term begins, but we encourage you to apply earlier, and recommend applying at least 6 weeks before the deadline. some providers may ask for codes before the deadline, so we recommend you speak to your provider to find out if this is the case. the deadlines are:
if my child turns 9 months old between
i can access 30 funded hours from
and i need to apply by
1 january to 31 march term starting on or after 1 april 31 march
1 april to 31 august term starting on or after 1 september 31 august
1 september to 31 december term starting on or after 1 january 31 december
before you apply, you’ll need to make sure you have the following information to hand:
your national insurance number (or unique taxpayer reference if you are self-employed)
the date you started or are due to start work
details of any government support or benefits you receive
the uk birth certificate reference number (if you have one) for your child
if you are a foster carer, there is a separate application process. speak to your social worker to find out more.
once you have applied, you will receive an 11-digit code to give to your childcare provider to access the entitlements.
you’ll need to take the code to your childcare provider, along with your national insurance number and your child’s date of birth. your childcare provider will check the code and then allocate your child a place if they have one available.
if you have applied and are waiting for a code, we still recommend you speak to your provider to let them know you intend to take up a place.
once you have received your code, you will need to reconfirm every 3 months even if you have not yet started using your entitlements.
reconfirmation
codes need to be reconfirmed every three months. remember to log in to your childcare account on gov.uk to check when your reconfirmation dates are, so that you can renew your code on time. you will also receive reminders from hmrc when it is time for you to reconfirm.
if you aren’t able to renew your code by your reconfirmation deadline, you may be able to retain your child’s childcare place for a short period; this is known as a grace period. your provider will be able to tell you if you are in a grace period.

tax-free childcare - frequently asked questions
are parents able to use tax-free childcare in addition to workplace salary sacrifice schemes, such as childcare vouchers?
no. you can’t use tax-free childcare and workplace salary sacrifice schemes, such as childcare vouchers, together. if a parent decides to apply for tax-free childcare, they will have to notify their employer and leave their childcare voucher scheme within 3 months from the date of their tax-free childcare declaration.
tax-free childcare is replacing workplace salary sacrifice schemes, which closed to new entrants in october 2018. it offers wider and more flexible support with childcare costs to more working families.
what can tax-free childcare be used for; does it include lunches, music lessons etc?
families can use tax-free childcare to pay for any approved childcare, including holiday clubs, breakfast and after school clubs, child minders and nurseries. it can also be used for nursery deposits, retainers (for holiday periods), childcare payments in advance and extras, such as lunches or trips, if/when these are included as part of the overall childcare costs charged by the childcare provider.
tax-free childcare can’t be used for any part a child’s compulsory education costs. this includes:
school lunches
private lessons during school time, such as private music lessons
school uniform
school lunches
costs for school trips within the normal school day
my child's school uses an independent payment provider to pay for various services. can i use tax-free childcare to pay for before/after school and holiday childcare (including breakfast clubs, after school activities and holiday clubs)?
tax-free childcare payments can be made through online payment providers provided they are signed to do so with hmrc. you can check with your payment provider and/or school whether this option is available to use. if the option is not available, you might want to encourage them to do so.
can i use tax-free childcare if the childcare is provided by a family member?
you can use tax-free childcare to pay a relative (like a grandparent) for childcare as long as they're a registered and approved childcare provider and the childcare takes place outside your child's home.
you cannot use tax-free childcare for childcare provided by a parent, stepparent, partner's partner or anyone who has parental responsibility. or a foster parent. this type of childcare is not considered to be registered and approved childcare for tax-free childcare.
will using tax-free childcare affect my child benefit?
no, using tax-free childcare has no effect on claiming child benefit. child benefit is paid to a parent, if eligible, to help them raise a child they are responsible for. tax-free childcare contributes towards working parents’ childcare costs.
a parent cannot claim tax-free childcare at the same time as childcare vouchers or universal credit.
can parents of a disabled child claim tax-free childcare alongside disability allowances?
parents can claim tax-free childcare if their child is in receipt of any of the following:
disability living allowance
personal independence payment
armed forces independence payment
child disability payment or adult disability payment (scotland only)
is there a maximum amount that parents can put in the tax-free childcare account?
there is no limit on the amount a parents can deposit into the account, but the maximum government top-up they will receive every 3 months is £500 for each child, or £1000 if their child is disabled. once a parent has reached the maximum top-up, they will need to wait until they enter their next eligibility period before they can get further government contributions.
is tax-free childcare available when i'm on parental or adoption leave?
if you’re on maternity, paternity, shared parental or adoption leave, you can usually get tax-free childcare, but you should apply from a certain date. that date will depend on when you return to work.

is there a minimum amount i must pay for childcare per week or month to use tax-free childcare?
there is no minimum amount that you need to deposit into your tax-free childcare account. for every £8 you pay into your account, the government adds an extra £2.
you can get up to £500 every 3 months in top-up (up to £2,000 a year) for each of your children to help with the costs of childcare. this goes up to £1,000 every 3 months if your child is disabled (up to £4,000 a year).
any money in your account will remain for you to pay your childcare provider when required. if you withdraw funds, the government will take back it’s £2 ‘top up’ for every £8 withdrawn.

how tax-free childcare works
set up an online childcare account for your child on gov.uk.
search for childcare providers through the online account using their name, town, or post code. if your childcare provider is signed up to tax-free childcare, you can add them to your account and start paying them straight away. if they aren’t registered, you will be able to send them a nudge notification asking them to sign-up to the scheme.
deposit money into the account. for every £8 you pay into this account, the government will pay in £2 to use to pay your childcare provider. you can get up to £500 every 3 months (up to £2,000 a year) for each of your children to help with the costs of childcare. this goes up to £1,000 every 3 months if a child is disabled (up to £4,000 a year).
use the money to pay your childcare provider through your online account.
reconfirm your eligibility for tax-free childcare every three months. you’ll get a reminder and it’s easy to do through your online account.
if your child is disabled
you can use tax-free childcare payment to cover additional childcare hours. the payment can also be used to help pay your childcare provider buy specialist equipment, such as mobility aids. talk to your provider to find out what equipment might be available to support your child.

eligibility for universal credit childcare
you need to be either:
in paid work
starting a job in the next month
if you live with a partner, you both need to be in paid work, unless your partner cannot look after your children.
it does not matter how many hours you work - there is no minimum although the hours of childcare provided must relate to the hours that you are in work.
it must be paid work, so you’re not eligible if you are volunteering and only getting money for expenses.
if you’re on sick leave, you may also be eligible if you’re getting statutory sick pay.
if you’re on maternity, paternity or adoption leave, you may also be eligible if you’re getting one of the following:
statutory maternity pay
statutory paternity pay
statutory shared parental pay
statutory adoption pay
maternity allowance
if your partner does not work but cannot look after your children
you can still claim childcare costs if your partner:
has a health condition or disability which means they have limited capability for work (lcw) or limited capability for work related activity (lcwra)
cares for a severely disabled person (and is eligible for carer’s allowance)
has to be away from home temporarily, for example in hospital
still not sure if you're eligible?

how universal credit childcare works
universal credit can help with the costs of childcare. you may be able to claim up to 85% of your registered childcare costs if you’re eligible for universal credit, in paid work or due to start a job in the next month.
you have to pay for your childcare costs yourself unless you are eligible for an initial up-front childcare cost payment. you then report them through your universal credit account and will be paid some of the money back in your next universal credit payment. you can get up to 85% of childcare costs paid back to you. the maximum amount for each assessment period is:
£1,031.88 for one child
£1,768.94 for 2 or more children
you will only get the money back with universal credit after the childcare actually happens.
you can claim universal credit childcare costs for all the children you’re responsible for until the 31 august after their 16th birthday.
what can childcare costs cover?
childcare costs can be used to cover childcare costs within ‘registered’ childcare providers.
usually that means they registered with ofsted, the care inspectorate in scotland or the care inspectorate wales.
that could include nurseries, preschools, after-school clubs, breakfast clubs, childminders, nannies and some holiday clubs.
universal credit will cover ‘reasonable’ childcare costs that help you work or get into work. that could include:
a ‘settling-in period’ before you start work, so your child can get used to being in childcare
childcare while you travel to work
childcare in the assessment period after you lose a job
childcare for changing work patterns or zero-hours contracts can also be considered ‘reasonable’.
for example, if you have to pay childcare costs so that you are available to work your usual hours, and then you actually get less work hours than you expected, that’s considered ‘reasonable’.
