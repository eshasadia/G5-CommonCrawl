At a time when schools remain closed to most children, the online initiative aims to inspire future talent to work in the cyber security sector and give students a variety of extracurricular activities to do from the safety of their homes.

Teens can learn how to crack codes, fix security flaws and dissect criminals’ digital trails while progressing through the game as a cyber agent. This will help them develop important skills needed for future jobs, particularly in cyber security.

The school provides free weekly webinars run by industry experts teaching fundamental security disciplines such as digital forensics, cryptography and operating systems.

Digital Infrastructure Minister Matt Warman said:

This new initiative will give teenagers something fun and educational to do from home and provide them with a glimpse into the life of a cyber security professional.

We have a world-leading cyber sector which plays a crucial role protecting the country and our digital economy, so it is absolutely vital we continue to inspire the next generation of tech talent to help maintain the UK’s strong position.

The move comes as the government announces a number of other online training courses to give UK school pupils the opportunity to learn and develop cyber security skills, this includes the launch of the National Cyber Security Centre’s (NCSC) hugely popularCyberFirst summer courses. The courses are moving online this year to help more than a thousand 14 to 17-year-olds develop important cyber skills from home during the coronavirus pandemic.

NCSC Chief Executive Officer Ciaran Martin said:

Technology is helping us all cope with the coronavirus crisis and is playing an essential role in keeping our businesses moving and our society connected.

It has never been more important for our young people to keep engaged and learn how to protect our digital world - and I’m delighted to see our instructor led CyberFirst summer courses made available online.

Enrolled students will learn how to code and carry out cybersecurity operations in an instructor-led virtual classroom to help guide the students through the programme and build a sense of camaraderie within each cohort.

The National Crime Agency and Cyber Security Challenge UK will also this week announce teenagers can access their online cyber skills platformCyberLandfor free during the coming months. In the game designed to teach teenagers the fundamentals of cyber security, players protect the virtual city ‘CyberLand’ from cyber attacks while learning key skills.

Deputy Director at the NCA’s National Cyber Crime Unit Jim Stokley said:

Many young people have a keen interest in technology and have developed impressive cyber skills.

The virtual cyber school and CyberFirst programmes are great initiatives which will support this next generation of cyber defenders in realising their potential.

We’ve also partnered with Cyber Security Challenge UK to offer free access to their online platform Cyberland where young people will find games that encourage them to improve cyber skills safely and legally.

Computer science teacher & EdTech evangelist Mark Martin said:

This is a great initiative to encourage young people to consider future careers in cyber security and see that they can have a tech job keeping people safe online.

The virtual cyber school will help students learn valuable skills needed to work in the industry in a fun and entertaining way. I encourage teachers to share these programmes with their students as a productive activity to do in their spare time from home.

Cyber Discovery provider SANS Chief Technology Officer James Lyne said:

Cyber security is a fascinating field packed with opportunities for innovation and to make the online world more secure. It spans every part of society and has a huge role in our future security and technology prospects as a nation.

This is your chance to learn how to ‘forensicate’ like a digital Sherlock Holmes, close down vulnerabilities before the hackers find them, and break codes.

Teachers, parents, students - get online and take advantage of this wonderful opportunity amidst the unique and challenging situation our country faces right now.

CyberFirst provider QA Chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield said:

These initiatives from NCSC and DCMS are set to deliver a great summer of learning for young people across the UK. There is a shortage of digital skills in the UK and the CyberFirst programmes tackle this issue head on – and have the added benefit of keeping young minds active at this difficult time.

The road to the UK’s economic recovery from this pandemic will be built on the skills we learn at this time. That’s why it was critical that initiatives like CyberFirst were pivoted to virtual delivery, so they could go ahead as planned. We are proud to partner with the NCSC to deliver these fully virtual training programmes."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/blueprint-for-100-multi-million-pound-town-deals-revealed,Press release,Blueprint for 100 multi-million pound Town Deals revealed,"Towns Fund prospectus paves the way for a new generation of Town Deals to regenerate town centres, boost businesses and improve infrastructure.","Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (2018 to 2021) and The Rt Hon Jake Berry",1 November 2019,"

The blueprint for a new generation of multi-million Town Deals was announced today (1 November 2019) by Communities and Local Government Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP.

TheTowns Fund prospectusprovides information to councils in 100 places chosen to pioneer Town Deals – they will receive a share of £16.4 million capacity funding to kick-start their innovative plans and bring their communities together.

Each place will have the opportunity to bid for funding of up to £25 million as part of the government’s £3.6 billion Towns Fund.

The funding could be used to redevelop vacant buildings and land, drive private sector investment by supporting small businesses and ensure young people have the skills they need to get good jobs. Communities will also be able to consider how they can boost their transport links and increase access to high-speed broadband.

Communities and Local Government Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:

This government is committed to levelling up all parts of the country. We created the £3.6bn Towns Fund to help businesses grow, connect communities and give people the skills they need to succeed.

But no place is exactly the same. That is why we want to help local people to decide how this investment of up to £25 million in each town can be used to help create new businesses, new jobs and new homes for generations to come.”

The announcement follows the launch of the My Town campaign, giving local people the chance to share what they love about their town and how they want to see it grow. In just one week, the campaign has drawn over 10,000 responses from across the country.

Lead councils in each place will now bring together a Town Deal Board including representatives from across the public, private and voluntary sectors to develop bespoke Town Investment Plans by summer 2020.

These plans will provide a clear vision for building on their town’s unique strengths to transform its economic growth prospects and form the basis of negotiations with the government.

Minister for the Northern Powerhouse and Local Growth Rt Hon Jake Berry MP said:

We are giving local people the money and power to decide what is best for their town because they know their community’s unique strengths.

Together we can build on the billions of pounds the government has already invested in our towns and the thousands of new jobs and businesses it has delivered, to level up these places across the Northern Powerhouse and beyond.

See the100 places being supported to develop Town Deals.

A total of 100 places – including 45 places across the Northern Powerhouse and 30 places in the Midlands Engine – will be the pioneers of new Town Deals building on the Prime Minister’s announcement in July of an additional £1.325 billion to support towns as part of a renewed vision to level up every part of our country, which took the total value of the Towns Fund to £3.6 billion.

In due course the government will announce details of a competition for further towns beyond the initial 100 to develop plans for their own Town Deals.

The government wants to make sure that all parts of the UK can benefit from resources to boost productivity and living standards. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government is in ongoing discussions with colleagues across government about how we can better support our towns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and make sure areas throughout the UK share in the opportunities of Brexit.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/opening-doors-for-young-disabled-people-to-engage-in-youth-work,Press release,Opening doors for young disabled people to engage in youth work,A new Ofsted survey finds that more needs to be done to ensure disabled young people can access local youth work provision.,Ofsted,31 January 2013,"The survey reporthighlights where more could be done in the planning of youth services for disabled young people within a local area. It is intended to serve as a guide to local authorities and providers to identify the key factors that make schemes successful and adapt local provision accordingly.

The reported proportions of disabled young people who access local authority youth work provision were low. Inspectors found that some disabled young people were not known to local authorities so were potentially missing out on the services on offer.

National Director for Learning and Skills, Matthew Coffey:

This survey indicates there is a worrying lack of planning in relation to the commissioning of youth services for disabled young people. Initiatives to increase access to youth work are provided through a complex network of local authority services and charities. What is clear is that better planning of services in relation to local need and better training for adult workers and volunteers would ensure more young disabled people benefit from the opportunities and support that youth work affords.

Despite this fairly negative national picture, there are examples of local authorities and providers delivering hugely effective programmes of support that have a beneficial impact on the lives of young disabled people. The best support we saw focused on developing young people’s personal, social, political and work-related skills and aptitudes.

While the government does not prescribe which services and activities for young people should be funded by the local authority, statutory guidance requires local authorities to secure access to youth work. This means some local areas see access to youth work for disabled people as a more of priority than others.

The survey noted some good planning where charities and voluntary organisations worked well together to provide for young disabled people in their leisure time. Overall, however, the report highlights inconsistencies across regions. The best local arrangements involved the local authority, charities and the voluntary sector working together and sharing expertise. Indeed, inspectors reported this mix was fundamental as it was a way of getting the best from the diminishing resources dedicated to youth work.

The report also found that many adult workers and volunteers who support young disabled people in their youth work could also be given more opportunity for further training.

A range of fast and effective security capabilities were agreed with the EU, which will help bear down on criminals and bring them to justice.

Measures agreed include:

streamlined extradition arrangements

an arrangement enabling the fast and effective exchange of national DNA, fingerprint and vehicle registration data via the Prüm system to aid law enforcement agencies in investigating crime and terrorism

continued operational co-operation with Europol and Eurojust that reflect the scale of our contribution to these agencies

arrangements enabling the fast and effective exchange of criminal records data via shared technical infrastructure

arrangements providing for continued transfers of Passenger Name Record data to protect the public from serious crime and terrorism

It is the first time the EU has agreed such a comprehensive agreement with a third country in this area. It ensures the UK can work with counterparts across Europe to tackle serious crime and terrorism, protecting the public and bringing criminals to justice.

Home Secretary Priti Patel said:

The safety and security of UK citizens is the government’s top priority and the UK will continue to be one of the safest countries in the world.

I’m immensely proud of the  comprehensive package of capabilities we’ve agreed with the EU. It means both sides have effective tools to tackle serious crime and terrorism, protecting the public and bringing criminals to justice.

But we will also seize this historic opportunity to make the UK safer and more secure through firmer and fairer border controls.

The UK is a leader in global security and will continue to play its part on the international stage to keep people safe. In addition to the deal, work such as the UK’s 2025 Border Strategy and co-operation with international partners, will ensure we tackle threats as varied as terrorism, organised crime and illegal migration.

From 1 January 2021, free movement will end and tougher border rules for EU criminals will come into force. Under these changes, foreign criminals sentenced to more than a year in jail will be banned from entering the UK.

The UK will also make it harder for criminals to operate and smuggle illicit commodities such as guns and drugs into the country. From July 2021, the UK will start receiving advance data on all goods coming from the EU into Great Britain, something which has not previously been possible under EU rules.

The UK is also phasing out the use of insecure identity documents used to enter the UK. From 1 October 2021, the UK will refuse to recognise EEA and Swiss national identity cards which are some of the most insecure and abused documents seen at the border and often used by organised crime groups.

The government is also providing the police with more powers to protect the public. From 1 January 2021, the police will have the power to detain fugitives wanted by close partner countries immediately without having to apply for a UK arrest warrant first. This means that criminals will be brought to justice faster.

Further details on the security arrangement can be found on theUK-EU trade and co-operation agreement summary."

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/boost-for-space-clusters-across-the-uk,Press release,Boost for space clusters across the UK,"Ten space clusters across the UK have been given a boost, thanks to new UK Space Agency funding.",UK Space Agency,2 February 2022,"This story is over a year old.

These regional hubs, known as space clusters, will support new and growing companies, building on local expertise and catalysing investment into the space sector.

Over £600,000 will go towards supporting activities that create jobs and growth, including recruiting space cluster managers, to strengthen local space sector leadership groups and developing new business opportunities.

The funding comes as the Government is set to unveil its flagshipLevelling Up White Paperlater today (2 February 2022), setting out a plan to transform the UK by spreading opportunity and prosperity to all parts of it.

Space plays a pivotal role in our daily lives and is already a vital part of the UK economy, worth over £16 billion per year. However, the balance of investment and jobs is skewed towards certain regions.

The government recently launched itsNational Space Strategywhich outlines its long-term plans to grow and level up the space sector across the UK.

Dr Paul Bate, Chief Executive of the UK Space Agency, said:

The National Space Strategy sets out a vision for ensuring we have a thriving, resilient and well-connected space ecosystem across the whole of the UK.

We are building on our strengths in space such as satellite manufacturing, while supporting emerging markets like in-orbit servicing, to unlock the growth in the UK space sector and help level up the economy.

Will Whitehorn, President of the trade association UKspace, said:

Additional grants of this nature are hugely important in helping to communicate the potential for the growing ‘New Space’ economy. Monitoring and understanding our world from space has already become crucial to our survival. Now industrialisation in space will be driven by the need to get to Net Zero and mitigate climate change by shifting more and more carbon generating digital activities outside the atmosphere, and even producing solar power in space. The opportunities these activities will bring to the UK should not be underestimated, from space launch to digital services and even infinity and beyond!

There is also an urgent need for continuing significant investment by government and the private sector if these goals are to be achieved and the UK is able to move into the top tier of nations leading the industrial revolution in space.

Funding has gone to the following organisations in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland:

Cornwall space cluster will use grant funds to hold a series of workshops and events to showcase local business capabilities to academic and industry partners across the UK to stimulate new opportunities for research and innovation. The CDC will also use funds to create a new cluster website, undertake research for a local skills strategy and refine the local space proposition for the region.

The West of England region will use grant funds to build and deliver on the recommendations from the West of England Space Strategy. Funding will support a range of activities to raise the profile of the region’s space sector, including attracting inward investment and hosting a regional showcase event.

Northern Ireland will use grant funds to undertake a series of cluster development activities that build on the recommendations from the NI Space Market Insight Report. Activities include the formation of a NI Space Leadership Council, undertaking stakeholder engagement to further mature the cluster and define a business case for sustainable cluster development.

Wales was funded to appoint a Space Wales Development Manager. The individual appointed will lead the implementation of the Wales space sector strategy as embodied in the document “Wales –a sustainable space nation” and development of the Space Wales network and cluster.

West Midlands region will use grant funds to promote the West Midlands cluster, identify business opportunities, connect businesses to academia and space suppliers including non-space companies that can pivot into both the upstream and downstream sectors. The MAA and the University of Birmingham will also use funds to hold workshops to showcase the expertise within the region.

Space Hub Yorkshire will use grant funds to appoint 2x Cluster Development Managers that will drive and take forward recommendations from Yorkshire’s regional space strategy. Funding will also be used to initiate and deliver a programme of events, which will be continued and sustained beyond the lifetime of this grant through in-kind support from regional universities.

Space Hub Sutherland will use grant funds to undertake cluster development activity around the proposed site of a spaceport and launch facilities at Sutherland.

As part of the Arc for Space Group, The Open University will use grant funds to support and coordinate regional space sector growth ambitions in the Oxford-Cambridge Arc. Work will be delivered in close collaboration with industry, academia and regional organisations. World-leading research programmes will be mapped to develop commercial and funding opportunities for the region to enable businesses to participate and commercialise R&D projects.

Scotland will use grant funds to appoint a cluster development manager to build and deliver on recommendations from the Scottish Space Strategy. Other activities will include identifying opportunities in the downstream sectors, scaling of regional STEM activities and undertake a series of stakeholder engagement activities to promote the cluster.

This grant funding is being used to establish a North West of England Space Cluster, that connects with and empowers the UK’s global space Ambitions.  It brings together all five bodies of the North West (Cumbria, Cheshire and Warrington, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Liverpool City Region) with local, regional and national stakeholder organisations. Through building the shared understanding of the regions sizable space-related research, innovation and business assets, the added value the space sector can bring to other industrial sectors and the opportunity for greater national and international connection, a vision and strategy for this cluster can be co-created. Hosted by STFC, a North West Space Cluster Leadership Group has been established, to enable and ready this cluster for launch later in 2022.

Each organisation will use the funding to support locally led space sector activities in their region. This will include business case development and evidence gathering for local authorities and economic development bodies.

The new funding for regional space clusters follows £500k awarded toseven space hubsacross the UK in 2020 to bring together local authorities, expertise and businesses to create a strategy for how their area can take maximum advantage of the commercial space race.

The UK already boasts a thriving space sector employing over 45,000 people in highly skilled jobs – from space scientists and researchers to engineers and satellite manufacturers.

The National Space Strategy looks to harness these strengths and support British companies to seize future opportunities, with the global space economy projected to grow from an estimated £270 billion in 2019 to £490 billion by 2030.

The UK Space Agency is working with local partners, Devolved Administrations, universities and industry to encourage more space businesses to start, grow and connect with the UK’s wider UK space ecosystem."

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-crackdown-on-fraud-introduced-by-home-office?utm_campaign=English%2BCrime&utm_medium=web&utm_source=English_Crime_289,News story,New crackdown on fraud introduced by the Home Office,New offence will make it easier to prosecute a large organisation if an employee commits fraud for the organisation’s benefit.,Home Office,11 April 2023,"The new failure to prevent fraud offence will make it easier to prosecute a large organisation if an employee commits fraud for the organisation’s benefit.

If fraud is committed by an employee of an organisation, the organisation must be able to demonstrate it had reasonable measures in place to deter the offending or risk receiving an unlimited fine.

The proposed legislation encourages businesses to do more to deter offending which will help cut crime and protect consumers, investors, other businesses and the taxpayer from fraudulent practices.

Businesses which fail to deter fraud will face enforcement action under new Home Office plans.

The tighter legislation, to be introduced through the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill, will allow prosecutors to hold big companies to account if an employee commits fraud for the organisation’s benefit, and they did not have reasonable prevention procedures in place.

The Home Office tabled an amendment to introduce the failure to prevent fraud offence earlier today, and it is supported by the Serious Fraud Office and the Crown Prosecution Service.

Security Minister Tom Tugendhat said:

We are determined to crack down on unscrupulous companies that seek to defraud their customers.

Our new failure to prevent fraud offence will protect consumers from dishonest and misleading sales practices, and level the playing field for the majority of businesses that behave responsibly.

This government is committed to fighting economic crime, as demonstrated by our recently launched Economic Crime Plan 2 which set out how we will give law enforcement more state of the art resources to tackle high level offending.

The new legislation will protect the public from a wide range of harms including dishonest sales practices, false accounting and hiding important information from consumers or investors.

It could also hold companies to account for dishonest practices in financial markets.

The new powers follow on from recommendations made by the Law Commission’s 2022 review of corporate criminal liability.

Lisa Osofsky, Director of the Serious Fraud Office, said:

This new offence would be a game changer for law enforcement – bringing the law on fraud in line with bribery.

As the UK’s top economic crime prosecutors, this would help us crack down on fraudulent enterprises, compensate their victims and ultimately protect the integrity of our economy.

Prosecutors will independently consider whether a prosecution is in the public interest before any charges are brought.

A business could face legal action if, for example, employees were selling products to a customer under false pretences.

It could also be held accountable if employees falsified accounts to mislead investors.

Under both examples, a business could receive an unlimited fine if it is found to not have reasonable fraud prevention procedures in place. This enforcement not only ensures justice is secured for victims, it also encourages companies to create an environment where it is difficult for fraudulent tactics to thrive.

There will be no requirement to prove that company bosses ordered or knew about a fraud committed by an employee.

A business will not be liable if it can prove reasonable measures were in place to deter the offence. The government will publish guidance on reasonable prevention measures in due course. The offence will not be enforced until the guidance is published.

Andrew Penhale, Chief Crown Prosecutor for the CPS, said:

The scale of fraud in the UK – now comprising 41% of all criminal activity – is so significant that extra measures to help prevent it and protect people from falling victim to this crime is welcome.

The new corporate offence of failing to prevent fraud is another important measure to drive better corporate behaviours and will complement existing measures for prosecutors.

Larger corporate enterprises, which fail to put in place reasonable measures to prevent fraud being committed by their employees, may be held criminally liable for that failure.

A primary benefit of the new legislation will be a drive towards better corporate behaviours which seek to prevent fraud. A similar outcome has been observed under the existing failure to prevent bribery and failure to prevent facilitation of tax evasion offences.

Small and medium sized enterprises will be exempt from the new offence but remain accountable under the existing legal framework.

The new legislation will apply across the United Kingdom."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/100-million-crackdown-on-crime-in-prison?utm_campaign=English%2BCrime&utm_medium=web&utm_source=English_Crime_103,Press release,£100 million crackdown on crime in prison,Airport-style security and cutting-edge technology to crack down on criminal activity in prisons.,"Ministry of Justice, Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Robert Buckland KC",13 August 2019,"Prison security will be boosted by a £100 million investment as part of a crackdown on crime behind bars, the government announced today (13 August 2019).

The investment will target all types of crime in prison; from drug smugglers fuelling a rise in violence and self-harm, to gang kingpins continuing to run their operations from jail, to offenders seeking to contact their victims in the outside world.

Tough airport-style security, including X-ray scanners and metal detectors, will be put into prisons across the estate to clamp down on the drugs, weapons and mobile phones that increase the risk to our officers and hinder rehabilitation.

Cutting-edge technology to detect and block mobile phones will be brought in to better identify and stop those who seek to organise drug supply or harass victims from the prison wings.

The new funding will bolster efforts to tackle corruption, improving intelligence analysis and strengthening the Counter Corruption Unit that roots out the small minority of dishonest staff and the criminals who seek to manipulate them.

In combination with the 4,700 additional officers who have been recruited since late 2016, this investment can have a major impact on crime behind bars. Without phones and access to drugs, criminal networks will be severely hindered, prison officers will be protected, and ultimately the public will be safer.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:

We cannot allow our prisons to become factories for making bad people worse.

We will stop the drugs, weapons and the mobile phones coming in, so we can safeguard victims, protect staff, cut violence and make our prisons properly equipped to reform and rehabilitate.

The public must see justice being done, punishment being served and feel protected.

Secretary of State for Justice, Robert Buckland QC MP said:

There is a direct link between crime on the wings and crime on our streets - it can no longer be assumed that prison walls are enough to stop organised criminals from continuing their operations.

This funding will have a transformative effect on prisons and give our hard-working officers the advantage as they tackle this scourge head-on.

By disrupting those who continue to offend behind bars, we can keep our staff and other prisoners safe, and make sure that prisons truly fulfil their purpose of protecting the public.

All prisons across the estate will benefit from the measures, with airport-style security being concentrated in the closed estate.

The new security funding comes days after the Prime Minister announced a programme of up to £2.5 billion to create 10,000 additional prison places.

The £100 million is the latest in a series of significant investments to increase security and stability in prisons, including £70 million announced previously. The £70 million funded new security measures such as improved search teams, a digital categorisation tool to better manage offenders’ risk, and improvements to the physical security and safety of the prison estate. Further funding has been made in previous years to build intelligence capabilities, a Financial Investigations Unit and a Serious and Organised Crime Task Force.

This has come against a backdrop of rising prison officer numbers, with more than 4,700 now recruited since October 2016 and staffing levels at their highest since 2012.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-crackdown-on-image-based-abuse?utm_campaign=English%2BCrime&utm_medium=web&utm_source=English_Crime_300,Press release,Government crackdown on image-based abuse,Abusers who share intimate images without consent to face up to 6 months in prison.,"Ministry of Justice, The Rt Hon Edward Argar MP, Paul Scully and The Rt Hon Alex Chalk KC",27 June 2023,"Abusers, predators and bitter ex-partners who share intimate images online without consent of those depicted will face jail time under new measures announced today (27 June 2023).

New amendments to the Online Safety Bill will protect victims of so-called “revenge porn” by changing current laws which require the prosecution to prove that perpetrators shared sexual images or films in order to cause distress.

Removing the need for lawyers to prove the intention of distress will make it easier to charge and convict someone who shares intimate images without consent – putting more offenders behind bars and better protecting the public. Those found guilty of this base offence have a maximum penalty of 6 months in custody.

And where it is proven a perpetrator also intended to cause distress, alarm or humiliation, or to obtain sexual gratification, they could face a 2-year prison term. Offenders found guilty of sharing the image for sexual gratification could also be placed on the sex offender register.

The reforms follow the campaigning of Georgia Harrison, who was the victim of image based abuse at the hands of her former partner, and Dame Maria Miller MP as well as recommendations from the Law Commission, to introduce reforms to the laws covering the abuse of images.

Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, Alex Chalk KC, said:

We are cracking down on abusers who share or manipulate intimate photos in order to hound or humiliate women and girls.

Our changes will give police and prosecutors the powers they need to bring these cowards to justice, safeguarding women and girls from such vile abuse.

Campaigner Georgia Harrison said:

The reforms to the law that has been passed today are going to go down in history as a turning point for generations to come and will bring peace of mind to so many victims who have reached out to me whilst also giving future victim’s the justice they deserve.

I’m so grateful to everyone who supported me throughout this campaign and it just goes to show how amazing our country is that the government have reacted so quickly to push through these amendments.

For the first time, the sharing of ‘deep fake’ intimate images – explicit images or videos which have been digitally manipulated to look like someone else – will also be criminalised.

Deepfakes typically involve the use of editing software to make and share fake images of a person without their consent, which are often pornographic in nature.

This type of image has been increasing in recent years with a website that virtually strips women naked receiving 38 million hits in the first 8 months of 2021.

Minister for Technology and the Digital Economy, Paul Scully, said:

The unsolicited sharing and manipulation of intimate photos is a cowardly and revolting thing to do and has an absolutely devastating impact on the lives of women and girls across the UK.

The Online Safety Bill will make the UK the safest place in the world to be online. These new laws set a global standard for bringing justice to those who share these images, protecting women and girls from this shocking abuse.

Research shows 1 in 7 women and 1 in 9 men aged between 18 and 34 have experienced threats to share intimate images, with more than 28,000 reports of disclosing private sexual images without consent recorded by police between April 2015 and December 2021.

By broadening the scope of current intimate image offences through the Online Safety Bill, more perpetrators will face prosecution and potentially time in jail.

Justice Minister, Edward Argar, said:

No-one should ever fear that their intimate images will be put online without their consent and the true courage shown by Georgia Harrison to tell her story will help empower more victims to come forward and get the justice they deserve.

Our reforms will make it easier to convict these vile individuals and protect women from being subject to such predatory abuse.

Domestic Abuse Commissioner, Nicole Jacobs, said:

Intimate image abuse causes significant distress to victims and survivors, and often exists as part of a wider pattern of abuse that continues offline.

I am pleased to see these changes in the Online Safety Bill that will hold perpetrators to account for this insidious form of abuse and hope to see it pass soon.

Ruth Davison, CEO of Refuge, said:

Refuge welcomes these amendments to the Online Safety Bill. Intimate image abuse is a multifaceted and complex form of domestic abuse, which can be perpetrated in many ways. In 2021, threatening to share intimate images was criminalised, following the success of Refuge’s ‘The Naked Threat’ campaign.

At Refuge, we know that conviction rates for intimate image abuse remain woefully low. The amendments to the Online Safety Bill announced today will make it easier to prosecute perpetrators of intimate image abuse, ensuring justice and better protections for survivors.

The overhaul of intimate image law builds on government action in recent years to better protect victims and bring more offenders to justice. This includes making ‘upskirting’ and ‘breastfeeding voyeurism’ specific criminal offences, extending ‘revenge porn’ laws to capture threats to share such images, and using the Online Safety Bill to create an offence specifically targeting ‘cyberflashing’.

The government has committed to bringing forward wider reforms around intimate images, following the Law Commission’s detailed review, as soon as parliamentary time allows.

The Home Office will work with Police Now, an award-winning police graduate recruitment programme, to develop the scheme.

The Home Office is providing £2.8 million to support Police Now in 2018 to 2019 and will provide an additional £350,000 seed funding for the detective entry programme.

The programme will include digital training to ensure that recruits are equipped to deal with the changing nature of modern crime. It will also focus on problem solving, crime prevention and safeguarding so that detectives on the scheme meet the needs of forces and communities.

Minister for Policing and the Fire Service Nick Hurd said:

Detectives are the fact-finders of our police service. They play an important role in bringing criminals to justice and getting to the bottom of complex crimes.

I’m keen to get more new detectives trained up, so I’m delighted to support this innovative Police Now programme, which will bring in new talent, train detectives in a matter of months and complement other measures that the government and police are taking to keep the public safe.

The programme will include an expanded version of the innovative summer academy model which Police Now uses to offer accelerated neighbourhood officer training.

Together these steps will help to ensure forces are matching the capacity and capability of their workforce to the demands they face, while also recruiting more people directly into specialist roles via accelerated training programmes.

David Spencer, co-founder and chief executive of Police Now, said:

As a former detective myself, I understand the positive impact that detectives can have on reducing crime, increasing confidence in communities and protecting the most vulnerable in society.

Working with forces and the Home Office, we hope this new scheme will encourage a new group of diverse and brilliant individuals to enter the police service and contribute to the outstanding work being done by existing detectives up and down the country.

The National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) and the College of Policing are also leading work on providing a national assessment of detectives and developing sustainable solutions to ensure that forces have adequate investigative capacity.

Chief Constable Matt Jukes, the NPCC’s National Lead for Detectives, said:

Detectives do a vital job investigating crimes, apprehending offenders and protecting people from harm. The complex nature of investigations and our work to protect vulnerable people has made the role of detectives more challenging than ever.

In order to mirror the changing nature of crime, we need to recruit and develop a diverse group of individuals, who will contribute to this vital area of policing and its future, underlining the critical nature of effective investigations to public confidence and trust.

Police Now is a national police recruitment programme which started in the Metropolitan Police. The former Home Secretary granted more than £5 million to the scheme in 2016, which enabled Police Now to expand and become an independent charity supporting multiple police forces across the country.

Police Now currently operates across 25 forces in England and Wales, and was recognised as offering the best learning and development initiative in the public and third sector by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) in September 2017."

Alongside this, a funding package is being agreed with councils to support the measures and tackle the rising infection rate, with further details to be confirmed.

The changes are in addition to existing regulations prohibiting household mixing in private homes and gardens, and have been agreed in response to high and increasing infection rates in these areas, with incidence rates over 100 per 100,000 in 6 of the 7 areas last week.

PHE, theJBCandNHSTest and Trace constantly monitor the levels of infection and other data on prevalence of the virus across the country.

Discussions are continuing with local leaders in Merseyside to establish whether additional measures may be necessary there and, as has always been the case, all measures are kept under constant review.

Asannounced last week, childcare bubbles will be able to form in areas of intervention to allow families to share caring responsibilities with another household, as long as they are consistent. This includes formal and informal childcare arrangements. People in support bubbles in these areas can also continue to meet in any setting."

The Home Office is making it simpler for all forces in England and Wales to use Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act, which empowers officers to stop and search anyone in a designated area without needing reasonable grounds for suspicion if serious violence is anticipated.

The nationwide pilot has been extended from a smaller pilot within the seven forces worst affected by knife crime, following an urgent review commissioned by the Prime Minister.

Home Secretary Priti Patel said:

We are experiencing a knife crime epidemic and I am determined to put a stop to it.

Police chiefs are clear - stop and search is a vital tool in combatting the scourge of serious violence and keeping people safe.

Today I am giving them my full support and more police authority to approve stop and search to halt this terrible crime in its tracks.

The rollout will see the Home Secretary lift all conditions in the voluntary Best Use of Stop and Search Scheme over the use of Section 60 by:

Last year almost 7,000 arrests for offensive weapons and 900 arrests for firearms were made following a stop and search.

Police forces will still be required to record data around stop and search and monitor its fair and proper use.

In addition, the College of Policing is currently consulting on new guidance for forces on community engagement around stop and search.

National Police Chiefs’ Council Lead for Stop and Search, Deputy Chief Constable Adrian Hanstock, said:

The authority to stop and search people in appropriate circumstances is a necessary power that allows police officers to tackle violence in our communities and prevent people from becoming victims of crime.

Every day officers across the country seize horrifying weapons and are preventing further injuries and deaths by using their search powers.

Section 60 powers to stop and search anyone within a designated area can be extremely effective when there have been violent incidents and police commanders believe there is a high risk of further violence occurring.

The extension of this pilot to all 43 police forces, and British Transport Police across the rail network, will help to reduce bureaucracy and allow officers to use Section 60 controls much faster when it is clear it is in the public interest to do so.

Today the government has also announced plans to shortly publish draft guidance on measures in the Offensive Weapons Act that relate to the sale and delivery of corrosive products and knives, and Knife Crime Prevention Orders (KCPOs).

This will pave the way for new criminal offences that will help to stop knives and dangerous acids making their way onto our streets, including preventing delivery to under 18s of knives bought online and making it illegal to sell and deliver corrosive products to under 18s.

KCPOs are civil orders which can be imposed by courts on any person aged 12 or over to prevent vulnerable individuals from becoming involved in knife crime.

KCPOs will enable courts to impose conditions - such as curfews or requirements to attend educational courses - that will help people resist being drawn into violence and help police officers manage those at risk in the community.

They will act as a deterrent to stop those most at risk from carrying knives, and these will be piloted once a public consultation has been completed on the guidance.

The Home Secretary added:

Our Offensive Weapons Act will give police extra powers to take dangerous weapons out of criminals’ hands, while Knife Crime Prevention Orders will act as a deterrent to those at risk of becoming involved in knife crime."

Victims reporting multiple offences will have more support from police, as officer time is freed up to focus on bringing justice rather than on duplicative record keeping. It follows a National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) review which found that 443,000 officer hours are spent filling in unnecessary forms and burdensome administrative tasks - time that could be better spent cutting crime and keeping our streets safe.

All reported crimes for a single incident will now consistently be recorded under the ‘principal offence’, rather than as multiple entries on a database that effectively re-records the same incident. The police will continue to pursue all offences involved, understanding how they are linked, as part of their thorough investigative work.

This will bring a consistent approach to the recording of all offences, seeing crime recorded more accurately. It also aims to drive up charge rates for crimes and make sure perpetrators face the highest penalties. For example, under these changes, where a victim has experienced stalking with criminal damage occurring to their property, police will now put stalking at the forefront of their investigation.

Today’s changes will be accompanied by training for officers in how to investigate such offences, to get the best results for victims.

Minister for Crime and Policing Chris Philp said:

Overall crime, excluding fraud and computer misuse, has halved since 2010, but we are determined to go further.

Victims must always be at the centre of our response to crime. Listening to forces and cutting unnecessary red tape will mean police officers can focus on solving crime and delivering justice for victims, as well as preventing it from happening in the first place.

We are confident that we will reach our target to have most police officers in history. With less unnecessary admin, we want them to be our most effective police officers in history too.

The changes will:

The changes will take effect in the coming weeks, following recommendations from an in-depth review by the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) lead for Crime Data Integrity, Chris Rowley.

Gavin Stephens, Chair of the NPCC, said:

Police officers must be totally focused on keeping people safe and ensuring they feel safe. We want to provide the best possible policing to the public and the work of the Police Productivity Review is aimed at removing barriers and improving effectiveness.

The review has already identified that 443,000 officer hours are spent filling in forms and dealing with unnecessary administrative tasks. These equate to the equivalent of attendance at 220,000 domestic abuse incidents, 270,000 burglaries, or almost 740,000 antisocial behaviour incidents.

Any move to free up our frontline to serve our communities is welcome.

Andy Marsh, CEO of the College of Policing, said:

We all want to see the police spending as much time as possible catching criminals and keeping the communities they serve safe.

Officers and staff must be able to maintain high standards and properly record and investigate reported crimes whilst not becoming bogged down in unnecessary bureaucracy. Anything that helps policing focus on its core mission, including this change, is to be welcomed.

Marc Jones, Chair of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, said:

As the public’s representatives to policing we have long called for changes to the way crime is recorded, to ensure it is more transparent and less bureaucratic.

We welcome these changes which will simplify recording, enable the police to focus on cutting crime and allow Police and Crime Commissioners to better hold our Chief Constables to account on behalf of victims and the public.

Spearheaded by the Home Secretary’s common-sense policing campaign, posting messages that may offend someone but where no victim has actually been identified should no longer be considered a crime.

Police will also be empowered to make decisions on cases where communications, such as text messages or letters, are malicious or rude, but not threatening. Officers should be on our streets investigating crimes like burglary, not comments made online. As such, they will consider if such issues should be dealt with by social media companies instead.

This follows new statutory guidance on the recording of so-called non-crime hate incidents, which will ensure police are prioritising the freedom of expression that our nation is built on.

And police will no longer need to record public disturbances that have already been dealt with or are quiet once the police arrive at the scene.

The improvements will give a clearer picture of police caseload and better hold them to account for their response. Reviews of the counting rules are regularly undertaken, with significant changes previously made in 1998, 2002, 2015 and 2017. The Crime Survey for England and Wales is the best measure of trends in crime experienced by the general public according to the Office for National Statistics and remains unaffected by the changes.

We are determined to bring all offenders to justice. Together with policing and the Crown Prosecution Service, we are looking at best practice models across England and Wales, and ensuring processes are proportionate. We will make sure the criminal justice system can work as one, reducing burdens such as unnecessary redactions, while maintaining victim and witness confidence.

Frontline public services must also match community and individuals’ needs. A new agreement between policing and health partners is being developed to deliver better care for people in a mental health crisis and free up police officers’ time to focus on fighting crime. This addresses concerns raised by Chief Constables over the amount of resource being diverted away from police work to respond to mental health emergencies.

The new National Partnership Agreement will be underpinned by the principle that mental health incidents should receive a health response first – while recognising some situations may still require police presence. Following this Agreement, local police and health partners need to work together to deliver improvements to triage methods used by the police, to ensure the right agency responds to a mental health incident, removing police involvement earlier in the process where it isn’t needed.

Further changes are expected following the NPCC’s review of police productivity, which intends to provide clear, practice and deliverable recommendations to improve the efficiency of policing."

Scheme will ensure the postmasters who  were the first to take legal action against the Post Office over the failings of its Horizon IT computer system will be compensated fully and fairly

After winning the landmark case, the group only received a fraction of the £43 million pay-out due to a no win, no fee” agreement with their litigation funding company

Rishi Sunak said a new compensation scheme will be set up in the coming months targeted at the postmasters who brought and won the landmark High Court case against the Post Office over the failings. The 2019 ruling paved the way for millions of pounds worth of future pay-outs and led to the Court of Appeal quashing the convictions of postmasters who were wrongly accused of committing crimes.

Despite winning nearly £43 million in compensation in 2019, the group was left financially disadvantaged after having to pay significant legal costs based on a “no win, no fee” agreement with Therium – the company which funded its litigation. Due to the terms of their legal agreement each postmaster received a small fraction of the settlement - equating to around £20,000 each.

Their action meant they were also ineligible to apply to the Historical Shortfall Scheme (HSS) which was set up to by the Post Office following the scandal to compensate postmasters who had to personally cover shortfalls in their branch’s accounts caused by the Horizon IT.

The new scheme will ensure that those who uncovered the injustice receive the same level of compensation as the postmasters who claimed through the HSS.

Whilst it cannot take away the years of distress, the postmasters who have suffered terribly over the Post Office Horizon scandal deserve to be fairly compensated.

That’s why we’ll be introducing a new compensation scheme for those who led and won the landmark legal case over the failings, so they can receive their fair share.

We’ll continue to stand by postmasters and their families.

The Horizon IT dispute has had a devastating impact on postmasters and their families, with many losing their livelihoods or being wrongly convicted for crimes they didn’t commit.

Without the efforts of these postmasters, this terrible injustice may have never been uncovered so it is only right that they are compensated fully and fairly.

That is why we have set up this new compensation scheme for those who played a crucial role bringing this scandal to light, which I hope provides a measure of comfort.

The pain and distress that the Horizon scandal has inflicted on hundreds of postmasters over the years cannot be overstated.

Without the efforts of the 555 pioneering postmasters who brought this to court, this injustice may never have seen the light of day nor would the statutory inquiry have been set up, which is why I made it my priority to ensure they are all fairly compensated.

While we can’t right the wrongs of the past, I hope this important compensation package is a turning of the page, as we continue working with the Post Office to ensure something like this can never happen again.

The scheme comes after the government announced a separate scheme last year to provide funding for full and final settlements for eligible postmasters who have had their Horizon-related conviction overturned, with those eligible to receive an interim payment of up to £100,000 each.

More details of the new scheme, including how postmasters can submit compensation claims, will be set out by the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy in due course."

Early adopter courts across England and Wales will test the system before the subsequent rollout to all criminal courts over 12 months. This will begin in Derby and then roll out incrementally to the others in the series.

The system will make all information about a case, such as charges, evidence and results, accessible digitally to all parties. Access to different kinds of information is securely controlled to make sure that each participant only sees the material that is appropriate to them.

The Common Platform cuts down the need for manual document handling and reduces the amount of paper documents produced. It also removes the need to copy information from one digital platform to another at different stages in a case, improving the way criminal cases are accessed, managed and processed. 
It will eventually replace the existing software applications: Libra, XHIBIT, Bench, Court Store and Digital Mark-Up with a single, streamlined system.

Amanda Lowndes, Midlands Head of Crime, commented:

We are pleased to have been chosen as the first of the early adopter courts to test the Common Platform digital product: it shows the confidence placed in us that we can successfully rise to the challenge in these uncertain times. I’d like to thank everyone involved for their hard work and the commitment they have shown to supporting the testing of this new digital platform.

I’m confident that by providing all the criminal case information in one place, and in a digital format, the Common Platform will help us support all organisations in the criminal justice system.

It will help us to work more effectively together, reduce delays and make evidence sharing easier. We’re very keen to work with our judges and others to test this digital product in our court.

The delivery of training and support to court staff, the judiciary and criminal justice partners in the first of these locations is already underway.

Once the early adopter phase is complete, the system will then be gradually expanded to all criminal courts in England and Wales."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/marine-milestone-for-englands-seas,Press release,Marine milestone for England's seas,The first ever plans for the future of the seas around England have been published.,Marine Management Organisation and The Rt Hon George Eustice,2 April 2014,"England’s first ever plans for the future of our seas have been published today (2 April 2014).

Themarine plans– which provide much-needed guidance for sustainable development in English waters – cover the coast and seas from Flamborough Head to Felixstowe.

They have been developed by the Marine Management Organisation on behalf of the Secretary of State Owen Paterson, who has formally approved the plans.

Aninteractive toolexplaining how marine plans affect your area also goes live today (2 April) – the Marine Information System.

Marine plans will inform and guide decisions on development in marine and coastal areas, while conserving and enhancing the environment and recognising leisure uses too.

This should reduce costs and increase certainty for developers, boosting economic and employment benefits for coastal communities and beyond.

The first two plans cover the East inshore and offshore areas, with a total of 11 plans covering all English waters anticipated by 2021.Our seas have become increasingly busy, with industries such as oil and gas, wind farms, shipping, aggregates and fishing competing for space with each other and with nature. The marine economy is currently worth more than £49 billion a year and has the potential to grow significantly.

Environment Minister George Eustice said:

UK seas are home to one of the richest marine environments in the world and are currently worth more than £49 billion a year to our economy.

We are making sure that environmental considerations are embedded in every decision about proposed developments along the coast from Flamborough Head to Felixstowe and in our seas out to the maritime borders with the Netherlands, Belgium and France.

By 2021, marine plans will cover the entire English marine area, supporting an estimated £50 million of economic benefit each year and helping to promote sustainable development of the marine area.

MMO Chief Executive James Cross added:

These plans are the culmination of years of work by government, industry, environmental organisations and many others.

We are delighted to be at the forefront of sustainable marine development, cutting red tape for developers while taking full account of social and environmental impacts.

The UK has one of the richest marine environments in the world, with more than 8,000 species recorded in our seas.

Plans will take full account of marine protected areas, recognising the wealth of species and habitats in our seas

TheMarine Information Systemis an interactive tool to understand how the East marine plans apply to different marine sectors and geographic areas. It will highlight policies that apply to a chosen area to inform plan users, and mapping information makes searching for your area of interest easier.

Experience from developing the East marine plans is already informing the approach to the next two marine plans in the South – from Folkestone to the River Dart in Devon – including expanding the evidence base.

The Simon Isaac (RX43) skippered by Brian Foad, was inspected by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) at Whitstable harbour on 1 May 2013 where it was found that his net did not have the required square mesh panel or headline panel and there was a deficiency with the extension piece.

The obstruction offence took place at Whitstable harbour on 4 July 2013 when Mr Foad prevented MMO marine officers from accessing the vessel to complete an inspection.

Mr Foad initially pleaded not guilty to all charges, but on the day of trial entered guilty pleas for the offences relating to the net but maintained his not guilty plea to the obstruction charge.

TheUK Space Agency Space Accelerator Programme, delivered byEntrepreneurial Spark, worked with entrepreneurs from all over the UK aged between 18-70, with business expertise in sectors such as aerospace, law, quantum technology, farming, environmental engineering, and healthcare.

Delivered through a series of virtual events led by a range of industry experts, the Accelerator aimed to break down perceived barriers facing under-represented business founders and open conversations about the opportunities that space can present.

Harshbir Sangha, Director of Growth at UK Space Agency, said:

I’d like to congratulate everyone who successfully completed our Space Accelerator. The UK has a strong entrepreneurial culture and a growing space sector, and there are significant opportunities for new space businesses to start up and thrive with the right support.

The Space Accelerator perfectly encapsulates the value we seek to bring as an agency: catalysing investment, delivering space capabilities and championing space. With record levels of investment flowing into the sector, we want to accelerate the growth in space start ups and create thousands of new jobs across the UK.

Participants included start-up leaders, established businesses in their early stages, and professionals from adjacent sectors who could benefit from space expertise, generating a vast and diverse network of multi-skilled space pioneers.

The UK Space Agency awarded £360,000 to the Accelerator over two financial years. This catalysed a total investment of £8.79 million from other grants and investors, opening up 80 new jobs and directly assisting 88 individual businesses between January 2020 and April 2022.

Since joining the programme, participants have reported an increase in their business turnover and customer numbers, as well as improved confidence in their own leadership skills, strategy planning, business models and partnerships.

James New, Co-founder and CEO of ODIN Space Ltd, said:

Our biggest achievement during the accelerator was raising our first round of investment. We raised £430,000 and it has massively boosted our growth.

The support from UK Space Agency, Entrepreneurial Spark and the delivery partners helped us hone our business model and boost our confidence when pitching to investors. It really felt like we were part of a major industry movement to develop new space businesses.

ODIN Space is now ready to launch and start protecting space assets against orbital debris.

The growing UK space sector is already worth £16.5 billion to the economy and employs almost 47,000 from all over the UK, representing a huge area of opportunity for a range of businesses. The first satellite launches from the UK, due to take off later this year, will also help to drive growth in the sector and enhance the UK’s position as a leader in the global space community.

The Space Accelerator Programme was developed in collaboration with partners including Airbus, Astroscale, the European Space Agency, Department for International Trade, STFC RAL Space and others. Entrepreneurial Spark provided one-to-one support to the participants, specialising in developing entrepreneurial mindsets in technically focused founders. Alden Legal hosted a series of regulatory and access to finance workshops, while AstroAgency delivered space focused market prioritisation and competitive analysis workshops and one-to-one sessions with participants. Grey Consultants provided open access business horizons tech talks to engage new-to-space attendees from all around the UK.

The UK Space Agency is now looking for a partner to design and deliver the next space accelerator phase to run until March 2025. This will include providing a focused package of targeted support to space companies at different stages of development and equip programme participants with the knowledge and skills they need to grow, wherever they are based in the UK.

Entrepreneurial Spark is an impact-led accelerator for entrepreneurs. With a decade of global experience running 22 accelerators, it has supported over 5,000 founders to start, grow and scale their businesses. The Entrepreneurial Spark team members are experts in people, with a focus on helping entrepreneurs overcome the psychological barriers to growth while building great businesses."

The prosecution was brought after the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) identified a discrepancy in the information supplied in the vessel’s fishing logbook when compared with the data returned from the vessel’s satellite monitoring system. The court was told that the discrepancy would have resulted in an underestimation of the number of days the vessel had spent at sea, which are limited under the Western Waters Days at Sea Scheme.

The scheme applies to UK fishing vessels of 15 metres and over in length fishing for either king scallops (Pecten maximus) or queen scallops (Aequipecten opercularis) in ICES Area VII and limits the number of days such vessels may spend at sea for each 3-month period.

At an earlier hearing the defendants pleaded guilty to 4 offences of submitting inaccurate entries for the times of departure and return to port on the electronic logbook.

Skipper Stephen Trust was fined £1,500 for each of 3 offences and ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge plus £4,997 contribution to prosecution costs. Skipper Mark Bolton was fined £1,000 for 1 offence and ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge plus £1,670 contribution to prosecution costs. Trust Trawlers, the owners of the vessel, were fined £1,000 for each of the 4 offences and ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge.

The total fines and costs imposed by the court were £16,467.

MMO recognises that the vast majority of the fishing industry is compliant with the rules that govern its commercial activities. We aim to encourage compliance with fisheries legislation through education, advice and guidance to the industry wherever possible. Where necessary we may take enforcement action which could result in a court appearance, potential fines for masters and owners, and forfeiture of equipment imposed by the court."

During his 1-day trip Clarke will make clear that he believes Scottish expertise is badly needed in Brazil and will be encouraging companies to seize this fantastic opportunity in one of the world’s biggest emerging markets.

The minister heads up a UK Trade and Investment campaign designed to help the UK oil and gas industry take advantage of openings in the booming Brazilian energy market presented by Petrobras, Brazil’s state owned oil giant.

Mr Clarke said:

There are huge opportunities for Scottish based energy businesses in Brazil right now. The Scots are world-renowned for their expertise in drilling in extremely hostile environments. This is expertise the Brazilians badly need as they invest hundreds of billions of dollars into developing their oil fields.

I am following up the Prime Minister’s trip to Brazil last year during which he successfully pushed Scottish excellence at the highest levels of the Brazilian Government, and the state owned oil giant Petrobras.

I want to discuss what more the British government and its network of ambassadors, embassies and trade officials can do to open the door to the Brazilian market for these companies. This will be good for Brazil, good for Scotland and good for the United Kingdom as a whole."

The Cabinet Office and the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) have joined forces to formally seek the services of specialist identity providers who will deliver safe and secure access to DWP services.

DWP will be the first to use the new Identity Assurance (IDA) digital services to support its flagship Universal Credit programme and the Personal Independence Payment, which from 2013 will replace its current complex and outdated benefit system.

The government’s IDA programme is designed to ensure that all users of digital public services are able to assert their identities safely, securely and simply.

An OJEU, which is published today is inviting bids to provide these specialist identity services. The contract will be in line with the Cabinet Office’s overall efficiency programme using smarter procurement and the move to put more services online through the Government Digital Service (GDS).

Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude said:

Our cross-departmental collaboration illustrates the smarter ways of working that will deliver more effective and user-friendly public services. Throughout, we have focused on the needs of the individual user and opened up the tender process to the maximum number of suppliers possible, expanding choice, promoting efficiencies and encouraging growth in the SME sector.

The IDA programme supports this government’s “digital by default” policy - part of its strategy for 21st century ICT - with digitally delivered public services offering greater convenience for users and better value for taxpayers.

Just last month, the Cabinet Office announced that overall efficiency and reform measures will save at least £5bn this year. In the first eight months of 2011/12, smarter procurement has already produced savings of £295m by centralising spend on common goods and services; and another £140m has been saved by demanding - for the first time - a rigorous business case for any significant ICT spend."

Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office, today met with staff in the Worthing office of My Civil Service Pension (MyCSP). MyCSP administrates pensions for 1.5million people across the country.

MyCSP is at the cutting edge of public service reform as the pioneer of a new ‘mutual joint venture’ business model. The new enterprise will be formed from a unique three-way partnership between employee partners, government and a private sector partner, each of which will own a share in the business. The business model is designed to give frontline employee partners greater influence in the running of MyCSP backed up with the business expertise and capital investment of the private sector partner. The Government too will also be keeping a stake so that tax payers benefit from the increased value of an improved service.

Preparations are well underway and it’s expected that MyCSP will ‘spin out’ from the public sector in coming months. Already, MyCSP Ltd has been created and the selection process for the private partner is in the final stages.

Francis Maude said:

MyCSP is breaking down the old binary choice between state or private provision of public services. I want front line staff to have more power to do their jobs the way they know is best. This is one way of making it happen.

The staff in Worthing MyCSP are really enthusiastic about making this work. I’ve no doubt they will succeed in building a thriving social enterprise which benefits the community as much as it does its customers.

MyCSP Ltd also has a strong focus on social enterprise and social corporate responsibility and is launching the innovative 1+1+1 programme in which:

During the visit, Phil Bartlett, MyCSP Chief Executive announced that RBS has agreed to provide banking services to the new social enterprise. Phil Bartlett, CEO of MyCSP said:

These are exciting times and I am immensely proud of our achievements as we prepare to launch as a mutual joint venture. Back when MyCSP was formed in April 2010 as the first cross government shared service we took over unmanaged and unmitigated risks and issues. Today, we have a fully formed, truly competitive mutual business model, with employee representation on the Board, an Executive Team committed to employee engagement, and robust plans for business growth. In fact we are already seeing unprecedented high levels of performance against service agreements. We are also pleased that RBS has agreed to support the mutual joint venture. Today Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office, visited MyCSP as our plans to be a leader in corporate social responsibility were revealed.  MyCSP Ltd will blend the best of public ethos with strong commercial capability. We also have plans in place to negotiate linking the reward package for the most senior executives to the average reward value for all; I am very much looking forward to announcing our private sector partner in the near future

MyCSP takes its corporate social responsibilities seriously. Sharon Crosland, MyCSP’s Mutual Guardian says:

MyCSP Ltd will strive to be a good corporate citizen and exemplar in our sector. Our organisation’s mutual values go to the heart of our understanding of our responsibility to be a good corporate citizen. We understand that businesses such as ours have an important role to play in creating jobs and opportunities locally and in caring for our communities. To reach out to the communities we live in we are launching our 1+1+1 programme in partnership with our people.

David Treacher, MD of Public Sector and Charities at RBS said:

RBS has a proud history of supporting social enterprises and we are pleased to be supporting the first mutual joint spun out of the public sector. We look forward to working with them."

Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude has appointed William Shawcross CVO as the new Chair of the Charity Commission.

Following his selection as preferred candidate, Mr Shawcross attended a pre-appointment hearing with the Public Administration Select Committee to discuss his suitability for the role. The committee were satisfied that he has both the professional skills and independence necessary to fulfil this role successfully.

Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude said:

I am pleased to announce that William has been appointed to this important role. William has long been involved in the charity sector, particularly in human rights and international aid. His writings have helped shape the debate on the accountability of humanitarian organisations. He brings strong leadership skills, broad knowledge and experience of the sector, and intellectual ability to the Charity Commission, which acts as the independent and impartial regulator of the charity sector.

I would also like to thank John Wood, who has served as interim Chair of the Charity Commission while the recruitment process has been ongoing.

William Shawcross CVO, the new Chair of the Charity Commission said:

It is a huge privilege and honour to be chosen as the new Chair of the Charity Commission and I am delighted to be taking up this role. Our charitable sector is one of the great strengths of this country, and I am excited about the challenge that lies ahead.

William Shawcross will take up his post at the Charity Commission on 1 October 2012.

The Charity Commissionis the independent registrar and regulator of charities in England and Wales. Its mission is to be the independent registrar and regulator of charities, acting in the public’s interest, to ensure that:
  * charities know what they have to do;
  * the public know what charities do;
  * charities are held to account.

The Minister for the Cabinet Office is responsible for appointments to the Board of the Charity Commission for England and Wales, and the recruitment for a new Chair of the Charity Commission has been conducted in compliance with the Commissioner for Public Appointments’ Code of Practice for Ministerial Appointments to Public Bodies under the principles of merit, fairness and openness.

Pre-appointment scrutiny hearings enable select committees to take evidence from the Government’s preferred candidate for certain key public appointments prior to the final appointment decision. Hearings are in public and involve the select committee publishing a report setting out their views on the candidate’s suitability for the post.

The role was advertised on the public appointments website and the Sunday Times appointments website. It was also highlighted on the Charity Commission’s website and Strategic Partners of the Office for Civil Society were invited to disseminate details of the recruitment to their members. In-house search expertise was also used to attract a strong field of applicants.

In line with standard selection processes, the recruitment for this role was rigorous and impartial. The selection panel was chaired by Mark Addison (an independent Public Appointments Assessor representing the Commissioner for Public Appointments). The other panel members were Lynne Berry OBE (trustee of the Canal and River Trust and former Chief Executive of WRVS), Sue Gray (Head of Propriety and Ethics, Cabinet Office) and Lord Bew (Crossbench Peer and academic).

The term of appointment is for three years, with the possibility of re-appointment for a second term.  The role is for two days per week, remunerated at £50,000 per year. It is not pensionable.  The reduction in the time commitment was proposed by the Charity Commission itself, and reflects a narrower focus on its core regulatory functions as set out in its strategic plan. The primary role of the Commission is as a registrar and regulator for charities in England and Wales.

William Shawcross is a renowned writer and broadcaster with broad experience relevant to the charity sector, particularly in human rights and international aid. He began his career in journalism in Czechoslovakia in 1968, and then worked as a war correspondent in South East Asia for the Sunday Times. His articles have been published widely in the UK and the United States and elsewhere. He has also lectured on geopolitics, South East Asia, refugees, the media and Al Qaeda. He was Chairman of Article 19 from 1986 to 1996; a board member of the International Crisis Group from 1995 to 2005; and a member of the Council of the Disasters Emergency Committee from 1997 to 2002.

William Shawcross has declared that he is not a member of any political party, although he had in the past been a Labour Party supporter and has canvassed on behalf of various political parties."

The Minister for the Cabinet Office, Francis Maude, visited Cambridge today to see first-hand how the town is already benefiting from London hosting the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games this summer.

Francis Maude met two Cambridge-based companies:

The minister met the companies to discuss the impact of the Olympics on their business and the government’s ambition to support small and medium sized enterprises across the country.

Minister for the Cabinet Office, Francis Maude, said:

I am delighted to see how local businesses are thriving as a result of the Olympic Games. It is essential that the economic benefits of London 2012 are felt throughout the country, not just in London, and that small businesses are given the opportunity to compete at a global level.

Small and medium sized enterprises are vital to our economy and it is good to see that London 2012 is helping them to grow. The Games are not just about amazing sporting achievements, but also about boosting businesses which will leave a lasting legacy.

Gary Moore, Touch of Ginger, said:

The impact of the London 2012 licence on our business has been immense - and we’ve hardly started. We expect to grow our business by 50% as a direct result of our involvement. As we emerge from the global recession, our company will be stronger and fitter as a direct result of the Games.

Alex Bloom, Managing Director, Spearmark International, said:

The additional profit that we will generate from London 2012 will allow us to invest in the future of our business in a way that would not have otherwise been possible in this tough economic climate.

This morning, Francis Maude attended a Cabinet meeting at the Olympic Park in Stratford, East London, chaired by the Prime Minister David Cameron. The meeting focused on how every part of the UK can take full advantage of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and the unique chance that that the country has to sell itself to a massive international audience.

This afternoon, Cabinet Ministers are visiting towns and cities across the UK to see for themselves how businesses, sports facilities, schools and organisations are benefiting from the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

With little over seven months before the opening ceremony, the construction phase is 95% complete and the project continues to be on time and on budget. Since work began on the East London site in 2008, £6.39billion worth of contracts have been awarded to over 1,500 business in the UK, with more than a billion pounds worth going to the East of England.

Hosting the Games this summer will put the United Kingdom in the international spotlight and the Government is committed to ensuring that the tourism sector maximises the benefits, boosting investment, jobs and growth.  Domestic tourism will benefit from a 20.12% discount initiative recently announced by Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt and during a trip to New York last September the Prime Minister launched the GREAT campaign which will focus on promoting globally everything the UK has to offer. The campaign will showcase the opportunities to invest in the UK and help to attract millions of extra visitors.

Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, Jeremy Hunt said;

London 2012 gives us an opportunity to showcase the best of Britain to the world and what this country has to offer. From our beautiful countryside to historic sites, sporting venues to our amazing cultural offer, Britain really does have something for everyone. I am confident that we will put on a sporting spectacular this summer with some magical, medal moments that we will never forget and that will inspire many young people to get involved in sport.

Sports in the UK will also receive a boost as part of the Olympic legacy with many of the world-class venues being opened up to local communities and initiatives to support sport in schools, communities and elite athletes continuing after the Games."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/councils-still-have-healthy-reserves-for-2012-to-2013,Press release,Councils still have healthy reserves for 2012 to 2013,"One year into the Spending Review period, the latest figures show that due to good budget management the majority of councils have not yet had to dig deep into their £10 billion reserves.","Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (2018 to 2021) and The Rt Hon Lord Pickles",29 December 2011,"Overall, English local authorities expect to be holding £10.8 billion in reserves on 31 March 2012. At the same time last year, their forecasts for 31 March 2011 totalled £11 billion.

All councils should keep sufficient sums of money in reserve so that they have a financial cushion to meet sudden unexpected costs.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

“All told, councils still have over £10 billion held in reserve to fall back on.

“Most councils have maintained significant reserves, which will give them room to manoeuvre on their finances in future years, and help them to support budgets, and deliver efficient local services.”

Determining the level and use of reserves is a matter for individual local authorities, taking into account local challenges and priorities. There is no prescriptive national guidance on the minimum or maximum level of reserves, either as an absolute amount or as a percentage of the budget.

Reserves are either: (a) earmarked, as a result of a policy decision by a local authority to use them for specific purposes (it should be noted that some earmarked reserves have to be set aside for specific purposes under statute); or (b) unallocated, these reserves are part of a local authority’s risk management process, which would be called upon in the event of unexpected costs and emergencies.

A recent report by the Audit Commission found that this year the vast majority of councils have sound financial management and are strongly placed to manage funding reductions. Further, the Audit Commission found that, on average, single tier county councils held unallocated reserves equivalent to two-thirds of their grant reductions. District councils held unallocated reserves of twice the value of their reduction. If earmarked reserves were included, district reserves were 6 times the value of their reduction, and, for county councils, nearly 3 times.

Source data for the councils’ reserves table is from the Revenue Budget (RA) 2010 to 2011 and 2011 to 2012 as sent to DCLG by local authorities."

Both of the ‘incubators’ chosen, focus on how technology can unlock the potential of social enterprise in the UK. Bethnal Green Ventures will launch their Social Innovation Camp, which will provide investment, mentoring and office space for start-ups who use technology to solve problems in three key areas:

Wayra UnLtd is a new partnership between UnLtd and Wayra, Telefonica’s technology incubator. They will identify up and coming social entrepreneurs who use digital technologies, and accelerate their entry to market by providing investment and technical expertise in a purpose built ‘Wayra UnLtd Academy’.

Minister for Civil Society Nick Hurd said:

There is no shortage of social entrepreneurs in the UK with the ideas, passion and talent to create successful businesses that improve lives. We also have a talented and growing technology community in the UK.  Increasingly we’re seeing these two come together, with innovative entrepreneurs and start-ups harnessing the power of technology to create real change for people and communities.

Paul Miller, Partner at Bethnal Green Ventures said:

Our aim is to provide investment and support to people who really understand social challenges so that they can build social ventures to improve the lives of millions of people. With this backing from the Cabinet Office, Nesta, Nominet Trust and Google Campus we’ll be able to do that for twenty new ventures a year, giving more people the opportunity to turn their ideas into reality.

Cliff Prior, CEO of UnLtd and Simon Devonshire, Director of Wayra Europe said:

We are massively proud to celebrate this new partnership to find, support and grow digital social enterprises in the UK. We are also thrilled the government is giving this special partnership its full support and backing. Together we aim to address significant social issues through the use of digital technology combined with entrepreneurial talent.

Round two of the Social Incubator Fund will launch in spring 2013 and will be open to applications from newer social incubators. Those interested in applying for funding can register their interest at socialincubator@biglotteryfund.org.uk  by 15th March 2013."

Signing up for National Citizen Service is a no-brainer, new ambassador Bear Grylls said today, as the programme for 16 and 17-year-olds rolls out nationwide.

Thousands of young people are embarking on the summer of a lifetime as they spend three weeks making a difference to their local community while developing crucial life skills.

Bear joins a band of backers of National Citizen Service, who include Alex Zane, Johnson Beharry VC, Ben Collins (aka The Stig), Danny Crates, Marlon Devonish MBE, Alex Gregory, DJ Mistajam, Melissa Suffield and Chris Hunter QGM.

Bear Gryll’s message was loud and clear as a call was made to all 16 and 17-year-olds to get involved with a programme that has the ability to make a real change to people’s lives. There are still a few places available over the summer. To apply go towww.direct.gov.uk/ncsor theNCS Facebook page.

Bear Grylls said:

Young people today deserve opportunities to develop the kind of skills that are about more than academics - such as teamwork, leadership, adventure, pride and responsibility. Young people don’t need to be wrapped in cotton wool - they need to be challenged in genuinely exciting ways.

That’s where National Citizen Service comes in. This incredible programme reaches out to young people in all communities around the country and offers the chance to learn great life and outdoor skills. I urge young people to sign up to the 30,000 places available to take part in this brilliant scheme this year.

Minister for Civil Society Nick Hurd said:

The young people I see doing National Citizen Service never fail to impress me. They have the drive and determination to make the most of their time for their own benefit and the benefit of those around them.

In return, graduates of National Citizen Service get the skills, values and confidence that allow them to move into adulthood with success and happiness. I’ve met NCS participants from all over the country and time and again I am struck by the very real and very positive impact they are making.

I would say this to 16 and 17-year-olds wondering what to do now the exams are over: get logged ontowww.direct.gov.uk/ncsand sign yourself up to the life-changing experience that NCS offers. You won’t regret it.

National Citizen Service gives young people the opportunity to gain valuable life experience and new skills, and make friends from all walks of life. Evidence from the first year suggests that the programme helps teenagers prepare themselves for their future.

Young people who take part get the chance to do outdoor activities, meet new people and put something back into their local community. It offers the chance to learn new skills and get experience that helps with CVs or college applications. It takes place over three weeks full time and then 30 hours are spent making the local community a better place.

National Citizen Service brings young people together from different backgrounds to work together, and teaches them what it means to be responsible and serve their communities.

1. This year up to 30,000 places are available and the long-term aim is for NCS to be available to every 16-year-old. There will be 90,000 places by 2014.

2. The National Citizen Service website provides information on the opportunities available this summer:www.direct.gov.uk/ncs."

The Fund is available to organisations with a turnover of between £50,000 and £10 million which usually derive much of their funding from state sources.

Grants of between £12,500 and £500,000 will be available to enable organisations to make changes to become sustainable in the longer term.

To mark the opening, Civil Society Minister Nick Hurd visited Age Concern Kingston where he reiterated the Prime Minister’s call to local authorities not to do the ‘easy thing’ and target civil society groups for cuts.

Mr Hurd said:

Charities, social enterprises and voluntary groups are the backbone of our communities. We know that the very real need to reduce the deficit means they, like the rest of society, will face tough challenges over coming months. The £100m transition fund will be a lifeline giving organisations the space they need to take stock and build sustainable plans for the future. It is not a replacement for sustainable long term funding.

“Kingston Council is a great example of a local authority working with civil society organisations to open up new opportunities in public services and help develop more sustainable funding for the future. But government cannot do this alone, we all have a responsibility to contribute to the places where we live and finding a way to support local charities and voluntary groups is a great way to go about it.

The fund, which was announced in the Spending Review, will be managed by the Big Fund, which is part of the Big Lottery Fund.

Members of the Demographics User Group (DUG), which represents major companies including Barclays, Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury’s, will present the award to Francis Maude at their annual conference at the Royal Society on Wednesday 12 October.

Since May 2010, the government has begun to publish new data including crime maps and data on government structures and spending. The government has also has committed to publishing regular new key data on GP practices, hospitals, schools, transport and criminal justice over the coming months.

Francis Maude said:

I am delighted to accept this award. Under this government we have made huge strides towards our ambition to be the most transparent government in the world. We have committed to regularly publishing information which will better inform the public about how services are run, enable them to choose services accordingly and grow the economy, as the marketplace for this information flourishes.

It’s a brave government which commits to publishing information which uncovers its own performance, but that’s what we have done and this is just the start. We will go on to identify more data which has potential value to the public and business.

Keith Dugmore, Director of DUG, said:

Commercial companies have been making the case for better access to government datasets for more than a decade. Public pressure has grown, but it is vital to have strong ministerial direction to make progress. Francis Maude is giving this, vigorously promoting both better access to existing government data, and also the exploration of new sources which would make another traditional census unnecessary. Members of the Demographics User Group (DUG) strongly welcome these developments, which will increase the efficiency of services to their customers, and fuel innovation.

The Cabinet Office is currentlyconsulting the public on ‘Making Open Data Real’. The public consultation invites views on how we can best embed a culture of openness and transparency in our public services.  It asks for opinions on important issues such as public right to data, usability and accuracy, and whether transparency has sufficient senior leadership support in public sector organisations. The consultation closes on 27 October 2011.

DUG’s 15 member companies are: Barclays, Boots, Camelot, Co-operative Group, E.ON, Everything Everywhere, GlaxoSmithKline, John Lewis, Marks & Spencer, Nationwide, Sainsbury’s, Serco, Tesco, The Children’s Mutual and Whitbread.

Since the Prime Minister’s first letter on transparency on 31 May 2010, the number of data sets published through the government’s data website data.gov.uk has doubled to more than 7,000  - including:

The Prime Minister’s second letter to Cabinet on transparency of 6 July 2011 commits to publishing the new data sets over the year, including:

It is the first step towards helping civil society organisations grasp new opportunities arising from the massive devolution of power to local communities and reform of public services that underpins the Big Society.

Speaking to civil society representatives at the National Council of Voluntary Organisation’s head quarters in London, the minister also announced he would consult on how best to improve the infrastructure that provides advice, training and funding to front line groups.

Already changes in welfare to work, health and social care and the criminal justice system, offer civil society groups more opportunities to bid for and run public services. The strategy pulls together ideas and initiatives to give civil society a clear picture of the government’s vision.

Nick Hurd, Minister for Civil Society, said:

Civil society groups cannot be immune from public spending reductions which are necessary for the whole of society. But our vision for a Big Society, with more diverse providers of public services and greater power for communities to make local decisions, brings huge opportunities to charities voluntary groups and social enterprises.

The Building a Stronger Civil Society strategy gives a clear plan for government support to charities, voluntary groups and social enterprises as they adjust to a new relationship with the state. It’s important that we hear from the front line about the kind of support that will really help them which is why we are launching a consultation.

Plans in the strategy include:

Charities, voluntary groups and social enterprises will also find new opportunities in the drive for greater transparency. For example local authorities are now required to publish all their spending above £500, which will give the sector greater access to competitively important information."

Francis Maude has announced a set of pilots testing fresh and innovative approaches to tackling the £21 billion of annual fraud in the public sector and signalling the end of the ‘pay first, check later’ culture.

The pilots have already delivered immediate savings of £12million in their first few months.

TheCabinet Office Counter Fraud Taskforcehas published its interim report today.

Since its first meeting in December 2010 the taskforce has overseen a series of eight pilots aimed at tackling the cost of fraud against the public sector.

The Taskforce’s zero-tolerance approach is driving a step change in how seriously the Government takes fraud. Today’s report includes a set of proposals which the Government will take forward immediately to develop the fight against fraud and build on the success of the pilots. The pilots included using data analytics to screen applications for tax credits before any money was paid and the innovative use of behavioural science’s ‘nudge theory’ to encourage late tax payers to pay on time by sending them text message reminders.

Francis Maude said:

Fraud is theft of taxpayers money. The National Fraud Authority estimates that fraud costs the public sector £21 billion a year. This is totally unacceptable which is why I’m really pleased to see our zero-tolerance approach to tackling fraud is working. We will no longer allow a culture of ignoring or accepting fraud.

“It is time to turn the tide on fraudsters and stop Government being seen as a soft touch by criminals. Every pound defrauded from the Government means that there is less to spend on frontline services like healthcare, education, policing and defence.

“The Taskforce has made a good start and has already demonstrated that immediate cashable savings can be made from doing fairly simple common sense checks.  Going forward we must take this further and work together to combat fraud across all public sector organisations.

The Government will roll out the pilots, which are expected to lead to savings of £1.5 billion over the next 2 - 4 years, helping departments to deliver the savings set out in the Spending Review.  The Taskforce will now expand its work across Government through the proposals laid out in today’s report to embed for the first time a coordinated approach to tackling fraud across Government.

The following pilots have made immediate savings:

There are four central priorities in the report:

Where the proposals in the report can be implemented immediately the Government will begin putting them into action. The Taskforce will now work towards final recommendations to deliver the above priorities by end year, as well as looking at the issues of error and uncollected debt."

Of the 3 million private tenants in this country, the vast majority report they are satisfied with the service they receive from their landlords.

Speaking in Parliament, Mr Shapps confirmed that with the private rented sector already governed by a well established legal framework, the government has no plans to introduce any further regulations.

Instead, he urged councils to use the wide range of powers they already have at their disposal to tackle the minority of rogue landlords that blight some communities, provide a poor service to tenants and damage the reputation of the private rented sector.

Council powers include:

New regulations were proposed by the previous administration in response to the ‘Rugg Review of the Private Rented Sector’, but have been judged by the new coalition to introduce too much additional red tape. These included a National Register of Landlords, regulation of letting and managing agents, and compulsory written tenancy agreements.

Grant Shapps said:

With the vast majority of England’s 3 million private tenants happy with the service they receive, I am satisfied that the current system strikes the right balance between the rights and responsibilities of tenants and landlords.

So today I make a promise to good landlords across the country: the government has no plans to create any burdensome red tape and bureaucracy, so you are able to continue providing a service to your tenants.

But for the bad landlords, I am putting councils on alert to use the range of powers already at their disposal to make sure tenants are properly protected.

Plans to increase the annual rental threshold for assured and assured shorthold tenancies from the current level of £25,000 to £100,000 will go ahead. The Statutory Instrument raising the threshold, ‘The Assured Tenancies (Amendment) (England) Order 2010 - SI 2010 No. 908’ was laid on 25 March and the change will come into effect on 1 October 2010. This will apply to all existing and new tenancies and will restore the position intended in the original legislation."

Organisations are being encouraged to come forward with novel ideas that can bring people together to tackle the problem of isolation in old age, the Cabinet Office and Nesta announced today.The call for submissions to the Ageing Well challenge comes as a new survey reveals that over half of people in the UK would like to help reduce the isolation of elderly people in their community, but almost a third do not have the confidence to do so.

Although 14 per cent of people are already trying to reduce the isolation of elderly, 34 per cent of respondents said that they would like to help but don’t know how. A further 12 per cent of people said that they have ideas which they have not yet put into action.

Nick Hurd, Minister for Civil Society, said:

It’s very encouraging how many people would like to help reduce loneliness in our communities. Through this Challenge Prize we are looking to support great new ideas that will make it easier for more people to get involved and make a positive difference.

Emma Soames, editor-at-large, Saga Magazine said:

Tackling social isolation is enormously important in helping older people to maintain their quality of life. There must be some great ideas out there for tackling it and this is a great opportunity to make a brilliant idea happen.

The Ageing Well challenge, which is run by Nesta’s Centre for Challenge Prizes and funded by the Cabinet Office, seeks ideas to reduce the isolation and increase the mobility of vulnerable older people, by creating new opportunities for people to give time, skills and resources. The deadline to submit ideas to the Ageing Well challenge is 14 September 2012 and application is viawww.nesta.org.uk/givingchallenges.Vicki Purewal, head of the Centre for Challenge Prizes, Nesta, said:

It is clear that communities have the ideas, skills and the passion to help reduce isolation in old age, but sometimes we all need motivation and help to get ideas off of the ground and a boost in confidence. This is why we have launched the Ageing Well challenge prize.

Elderly isolation is a growing issue with research from organisations such as The Campaign to End Loneliness showing that elderly feel trapped and alone. We want people to submit new ideas that have the potential to reduce isolation and increase mobility of elderly by tapping into collective skills and resources of neighbours, family, peers, organisations and businesses.

The survey results are promising as people increasingly recognise the impact that community initiatives can have as the appetite for volunteering time, skills and resources grows: less than a quarter of people volunteered to community action projects in the last year, yet a third plan to in the next year.Only a quarter of respondents said that skills are the barrier to put an idea into action, instead citing challenges in knowing where to start (48 per cent), followed by lack of time (45 per cent) and lack of funding (42 per cent).In the survey, people overwhelmingly called for community spirit, social groups, community living, good transport and strong relationships with family and friends of all generations when asked what they wished for to help combat isolation and lack of mobility among elderly. The Ageing Well challenge prize will reward innovative approaches that take these and other areas affecting isolation in to consideration.Twenty-five entries to the Ageing Well challenge will be shortlisted and given the support and opportunity to develop a detailed plan for their idea. Five concepts with the potential for sustainability and scale will then each receive up to £10,000 and professional advice to set up and test their projects. The idea that is proving most effective at reducing isolation, and has the potential to be even more effective in the future, will be selected in September 2013 and will be awarded £50,000.

Entry is via online application atwww.nesta.org.uk/givingchallengesand the deadline is noon 14 September 2012."

The law, contained in Section 141 of the Mental Health Act 1983, states an MP must be automatically removed from their seat once they have been detained under mental health legislation for more than six months. In contrast, no such laws apply to MPs suffering from a purely physical illness, such as a stroke or coma, that prevents them from fulfilling their duties.

Mark Harper, Minister for Political and Constitutional Reform, said:

This law is out of date. It sends out entirely the wrong message that if you have mental health problems your contribution is not welcome in public life. This should not be the case.

The long overdue repeal of Section 141 will send out a clear signal from government that the stigmatisation of people who have mental health problems should not be tolerated.

ASpeaker’s Conference report published in January 2010recommended that Section 141 should be repealed, saying that it was “unnecessary and damaging”.

The government’s intention to repeal Section 141 was announced today in a written ministerial statement. Legislation will be brought forward later this year.

The provisions in Section 141 of the Mental Health Act 1983 replaced provisions in the Mental Health Act 1959 which itself replaced provisions in the Lunacy (Vacating of Seats) Act 1886. Section 141 itself has never been used, but in 1916 Dr Charles Leach MP was removed from his seat using the provisions in the Lunacy (Vacating of Seats) Act after a protracted illness.

Detention under the Mental Health Act applies if an individual is suffering from mental disorder which requires hospital treatment and it is necessary for the health or safety of the patient or the protection of other persons that he or she should receive such treatment under detention.

A project between Leeds City Council and credit experts Experian recovered £500,000 in overpayments to suppliers. Internal auditing by the London Borough of Islington that involved checking invoices to their top 30 suppliers revealed that 10 had been paid twice and 2 more paid 3 times. The overpayments totalled £55,000.

Experian estimates that if more councils were to repeat this simple exercise, up to £147 million could be saved.

In a speech ahead of the government’s Spending Review the Secretary of State used the data to highlight concerns that councils are effectively “letting money slip through their fingers”. He said that the very process of publishing spending over £500 online would help stop duplicate payments and stressed that the need for councils to ”show us the money” was more important than ever.

Referring to the estimated savings, Mr Pickles said:

Now, you might say well, that is small potatoes. Hardly enough to plug the gaping holes in the public deficit. But actually, £147 million would pay the wages of nearly 9,000 care workers. And more importantly, it betrays a particular attitude. A lack of respect towards public money. And at every level of government, that has got to change.

Mr Pickles used the speech to send a clear message to public servants that they must not forget whose money they are spending and made clear that the “days of throwing money at problems are over”.

He reiterated that transparency, productivity and innovation must be the watchwords for the way councils do their business from here onwards.

Underlining his commitment to localism, he said that the years of government micromanaging were over and that councils would be put back in charge of their own money."

The fund, which will operate in 2011 to 2012 and 2012 to 2013 will help areas most dependent on public sector employment as the country makes the transition to private sector-led growth and prosperity.

Both private bodies and public-private partnerships will be able to bid for funding by demonstrating that their proposal will bring in private investment and support sustainable increases in private sector jobs and growth in their area.

Speaking in Bradford after the first coalition Cabinet meeting outside of London today, Mr Clegg said:

While we sort out the nation’s finances we can also help to foster a thriving and more balanced economy so that no region or community gets left behind.

The Regional Growth Fund will create the conditions for growth and enterprise in the regions by stimulating investment and create sustainable private sector jobs.

Alongside our commitment to waive some employment taxes for new businesses starting up in targeted regions of the country, this fund can make a real difference to companies during difficult times.

Mr Clegg also set out plans for local enterprise partnerships that will bring together councils and business on an equal footing with one voice, replacing the current Regional Development Agencies (RDAs). In a joint letter sent to councils and business leaders today (29 June 2010), Business Secretary Vince Cable and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles have asked them to consider forming new local enterprise partnerships that can provide strategic leadership in their local areas and create the right environment for business success and economic growth.

Mr Cable said:

We are determined to rebalance the economy towards the private sector, so it’s important we create a more effective structure to drive economic growth and development across the country.

We want a structure that reflects the genuine interests and commitment of enterprise, local councils and other stakeholders like universities and colleges. Local enterprise partnerships will provide that vision and then take on the task of renewing local economies and tackling local barriers to growth. Today we are asking them to tell us about their vision and I’m looking forward to what they’ve got to say.

Mr Pickles said:

If you want to rebuild a fragile national economy you don’t strangle business with red tape and let bloated regional quangos make all the decisions. Urgent action is needed to rebuild and rebalance local economies so that new businesses and economic opportunities spread across the country.

The solution needs to be local - we know that when councils and local business work hand in hand they can drive economic growth together and places can be transformed. Local enterprise partnerships are central to this vision which is why we are asking them what they need.

By giving up central control we will put democratic accountability back into the local economy making it responsive to the needs of local business and local people.

Local enterprise partnerships will tackle issues including planning and housing, local transport and infrastructure, employment, enterprise and supporting business start-ups. Other roles currently carried out by theRDAswill be led nationally, such as inward investment, sector leadership, business support, innovation and access to finance.

Further details of the Regional Growth Fund, and the creation of LEPs, will be set out in the forthcoming white paper on local and regional growth.

Alongside this, ministers also today announced plans for a green paper on business finance. As part of the government’s strategy to encourage investment in growing companies in areas overly dependent on public sector employment, the green paper will consider the evidence, and identify any barriers to the supply of finance in such areas. It will consider whether more can be done to encourage bank finance, and also look at other possible sources of finance - such as growth capital and equity finance. The paper will also consider the role for local stock exchanges, and whether concerns about lack of liquidity and diversification can be overcome.

Full details of the Regional Growth Fund, including who will be eligible to apply, and the criteria and process for assessing bids, will be set out in the forthcoming white paper on local and regional growth.

The Budget 2010 announced:

The government will shortly announce details of a scheme to help new businesses in targeted areas of the UK that need it most. During a 3 year qualifying period, new businesses which start up in these areas will get a substantial reduction in their employer National Insurance Contributions (NICs). Within the qualifying period, these employers will not have to pay the first £5,000 of Class 1 employerNICsdue in the first 12 months of employment. This will apply for each of the first 10 employees hired in the first year of business and operate in selected countries and regions. Subject to meeting the necessary legal requirements, the scheme is intended to start no later than September 2010. Any new business set up from 22 June 2010 which meets the criteria set out in the forthcoming announcement will benefit from the scheme; and to help areas and communities particularly affected by reductions in public spending make the transition to private sector-led growth and prosperity, the government will create a Regional Growth Fund in 2011 to 2012 and 2012 to 2013. This fund will operate in England only and support increases in business employment and growth. The devolved administrations will be encouraged to undertake similar action.

The government’s coalition programme states:

“We will support the creation of local enterprise partnerships - joint local authority-business bodies brought forward by local authorities themselves to promote local economic development - to replace Regional Development Agencies (RDAs). These may take the form of the existingRDAsin areas where they are popular.”

Local enterprise partnerships will tackle issues including planning and housing, local transport and infrastructure, employment, enterprise and supporting business start-ups. Other roles currently carried out by theRDAswill be led nationally, such as inward investment, sector leadership, business support, innovation and access to finance.

The government is determined that the transition fromRDAsto local enterprise partnerships will be orderly, working to a clear timetable. Legislation to abolish them was announced in the Queen’s Speech and is expected to be introduced to Parliament in the autumn.

The consultation follows thecommitment by the Prime Ministerto publish key data on public services, including:

The online consultation launched today asks the public, businesses and other interested parties for their views on:

Francis Maude said:

The UK government is determined to have the most ambitious open data agenda of any government in the world. We demonstrated that ambition recently through the Prime Minister’s open letter.  But we want to embed this approach throughout the public service and we want to hear from people about how they think we should do this.

It is an incredibly brave step for any government to become this open, but this is the approach we want to take in order to create public accountability and efficiency in our services and to drive economic and social growth.

Francis Maude, together with Business Minister Ed Davey, today also launched apublic consultation on data policy for a Public Data Corporation.

ThePublic Data Corporationwill, for the first time, bring together government bodies and data and provide more freely available data at the point of use, year on year within the constraints of affordability. Supporting the government’s growth agenda, it will open up opportunities for innovative developers, businesses and members of the public to generate social and economic growth through the use of data.

Edward Davey said:

Britain has always been a leader in the global knowledge economy, but now more than ever we need to make the best use of the information and data that we possess to stimulate economic growth.

A clear data policy for the new Public Data Corporation is a necessary first step, and we want to hear people’s views on how it should work.

Professor Nigel Shadbolt of the UK Government Transparency Board said:

These consultations are important for the future of open data in the UK. I urge anyone who cares about our country’s information infrastructure or the potential for economic growth and public service accountability to give their views and suggestions.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/online-tool-to-help-smaller-firms,Press release,Online tool to help smaller firms,A new online Solutions Exchange tool will help SMEs connect with government and learn about ways to sell to the public sector.,Cabinet Office and The Rt Hon Lord Maude of Horsham,22 June 2012,"Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office, unveiled the pilot of the government’sSolutions Exchangetool in Cambridge today. The online tool will particularly helpSMEsconnect with government and find out about potential ways to sell to the public sector or to pitch an innovative business idea.

Tendering for government business in the UK has traditionally been lengthy and expensive, with UK procurements costing twice as much as France and often shuttingSMEsout. This new service will allow the government to engage the market informally before any formal procurement processes have started. It will give suppliers, particularlySMEs, a quick, free-of-charge way to pitch innovative ideas to save money and improve public services.

The tool has officially gone live today, the same day Francis Maude visited some of Cambridge’sSMEsand successful entrepreneurs at an event designed to share learnings and views on government SME policy. At the event, organised by Cambridge Network, he met with a range of local businesses of varying sizes, including mobile technology specialist Bango, chemical technology specialists Owlstone and Cambridge-based Public Relations Consultancy Holdsworth Associates.

Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office, said:

I’ve heard time and time again from small companies that one of the hardest things about winning government contracts is breaking into government in the first place - it can feel like Whitehall is full of faceless procurers who are unaware of what smaller firms can offer. We are turning that around and Solutions Exchange offers an easy, informal way for smaller firms to find out about emerging opportunities and pitch ideas. For government it’s a new way to find out what the market has to offer in advance so that we can speed up formal procurement times.

The business community in Cambridge is a powerhouse of ideas and I want to see moreSMEswinning government business. I hope that the small businesses I’ve met today find Solutions Exchange a good way to break down barriers and to show us new ideas. We want to get feedback fromSMEson this initial pilot as we develop the service.

The tool works as an interactive online forum for businesses to communicate with government procurers. It is divided into ‘challenges’ and ‘themes’ - ‘challenges’ are emerging opportunities to work with government that are not yet at the formal procurement stage, while ‘themes’ are broader categories that allow suppliers to pitch their own innovative, cost saving, proposals direct to government. They will change every 3 months but the content will stay on the site as a searchable database for procurers looking to reach out to new companies.

Challenges include:

Themes on the pilot site include:

Suppliers with innovative ideas can log onto the portal from today free of charge and pitch in their views, making informal business contacts with government.

Letting councils keep their own business rates will put all parts of the country on a …","Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (2018 to 2021) and The Rt Hon Lord Pickles",19 August 2011,"New detail published on radical rate retention plans

Letting councils keep their own business rates will put all parts of the country on a stronger path to economic growth, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said today, as more detail of how fair new local government financing proposals will work were published.

The Government has publishedeight technical papers, exploring how councils would be allowed to keep locally generated business rates, enabling them to borrow against future rate income. Legislation will be introduced later this year to allow changes to start as soon as possible.

Under the new system ‘tariffs or top ups’ would be put in place to ensure a fair starting point for all councils - north or south, metropolitan or district. Top up grants will bring up funding levels so no council is worse off as a result of its business rates base at the outset of the scheme. And a levy will recover a share of any disproportionate gain, to fund a safety net for places in need of additional support. Those with business rates income above a baseline funding level would contribute a tariff payment to the system whilst those with income below the baseline would receive top-up funding.

There will be no change in the level of business rates nor in the way that they are paid. Local charities, voluntary groups and small businesses will continue to get the same reliefs from Government.

In the past, many councils have seen their business rates base grow without reward, because the money was sent to Government for redistribution as Formula Grant. The new scheme will enable councils to benefit from any increases in the total revenue from business rates, providing a direct financial incentive for local authorities to promote local economic growth.

Ministers are confident that the new proposals will boost local firms and local jobs as councils are put in charge of their own financial circumstances, and rewarded for building stronger relationships with business to strengthen the local economy.

Last year £19 billion in business rates collected by councils was recovered by Government and redistributed back out through a complex grant. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) called this one of the most centralised systems in the world.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said:

Councils deserve to see their business rate income repatriated in a balanced, fair and equitable way. Our changes will mean they can strive for self-sufficiency and have their own means to support local jobs, growth and protect the most vulnerable places.

The new business rates system will be much more transparent and today we are setting out more of the detail of our proposals so councils all across the country can see the potential impacts and how they could benefit.

The top up and tariff measures will safeguard those places that have relied on Government grant by making sure those areas with more business rate income than they need share a slice of that income. Every area will be rewarded for supporting local firms and growth. This is what councils want and precisely what we mean by localism.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/next-generation-shared-services-to-save-millions-for-taxpayers,Press release,Next Generation Shared Services to save millions for taxpayers,Changes to the way government shares its corporate services are set to radically improve efficiency across departments and save money.,Cabinet Office and The Rt Hon Lord Maude of Horsham,28 December 2012,"28 December 2012

Fundamental changes to the way the government shares its corporate services are set to radically improve efficiency across departments and save taxpayers up to half a billion a year, the Minister for the Cabinet Office announced today.

TheNext Generation Shared Services Strategic Planoutlines how government departments and arms-length bodies will work together to share functions such as HR, procurement, finance and payroll to deliver potential savings of between £400 and £600 million a year in administration costs.

TheCivil Service Reform Planpublished in June, made clear that the Civil Service needs to move further and faster than ever before to share a wide range of services and expertise, and this is a key step towards reaching that goal. The strategy sets out a new model of 5 service centres instead of the current 8 - 2 independent and 3 standalone.

1 independent centre will be run by a private sector partner, built from the divestment of the current Department of Transport function, the structure for the second centre will be announced early next year. 3 existing government centres, which already have a good economy of scale will continue to provide services.

Minister for the Cabinet Office, Francis Maude, said:

Sharing services simply makes sense. There is absolutely no need for departments and arms-length bodies to have their own back-office functions, and duplicate efforts, when they can be delivered more efficiently by sharing services and expertise. Plus it will save the taxpayer half a billion pounds a year. That’s why we have taken action and fundamentally changed the way central government departments share their services.

We want sharing services to become the norm, so every department has high quality, flexible and resilient services available. This means they can focus on their priority of implementing policy and delivering key public services.

The world is changing and so must the Civil Service. We are in a global race, and are faced with rising public expectations and spending cuts to deal with the deficit. The Civil Service needs to do things faster, be smaller and to provide more services online. It needs to be more unified so we have an exceptional Civil Service delivering the best for Britain.

This is the first stage in the government’s plan to share services, and the ambition is that this will be expanded to other areas of expertise such as legal services.

Head of the Civil Service, Sir Bob Kerslake, said:

The Civil Service is constantly looking to improve how it works. One way we can do this is by becoming more efficient, and sharing services is a simple and smart way of doing this. The Civil Service has always adapted to challenges, retaining our core professionalism while moving with the times.

By bringing together more of the services that departments use we can not only save the taxpayer millions, an important goal in its own right, but we can deliver on our commitment to become a more unified body providing a first class service to the public.

The Cabinet Office is providing strong leadership and is working closely with departments to implement the new shared services strategy.

Stephen Kelly, Chief Operating Officer for government, will oversee the programme as Senior Responsible Officer and will work with departments to drive through the transition. Robust governance has been put in place with a Crown Oversight function to monitor the performance of shared service centres.

Chief Operating Officer Stephen Kelly, said:

Next Generation Shared Services is an exciting and innovative programme which will gain real momentum in 2013. This strategic plan is the roadmap for a robust, measurable and successful programme for shared services which is fundamental to Civil Service Reform. The outcomes of better service quality, value for money and price certainty are keenly anticipated by departments, and I look forward to its full implementation."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-introduces-legislation-for-individual-electoral-registration,Press release,Government introduces legislation for individual electoral registration,"The Electoral Registration and Administration Bil, if passed, will tackle electoral fraud by speeding up and modernising voter registration.",Cabinet Office and The Rt Hon Mark Harper,10 May 2012,"The government today publishedthe Electoral Registration and Administration Bill, which, if passed, will tackle electoral fraud by speeding up the introduction of individual electoral registration and modernise the system of voter registration. The Bill includes the government’s plans for individual electoral registration, which would end the practice of the head of a household being responsible for registering everyone in a property.

Currently, the head of a household registers everyone who lives at the same address. Under the system of individual registration, everyone would register separately, each providing their own unique identifiers, like National Insurance number and date of birth, so their information can be verified.

The new registration system is due to be in place by the end of 2015. During 2014, voters would be transferred to the new system of registration by matching data on the current electoral register with other public records, so around 2 thirds would not have to take any action in order to remain on the electoral register.

Under the data matching process, an elector’s name and address would be compared against other public databases. If an individual’s details match then they will not have to take any action to remain on the register. Where electors details cannot be confirmed, individuals will be personally invited to register under the new system. This will help ensure that we have an electoral register which is as accurate and complete as possible.

The new Bill also paves the way for online registration, which would make it more convenient for individuals to ensure they are registered to vote.

Over the past year, the government’s proposals have been subject to extensive consultation and pre-legislative scrutiny.

Under the current system, failure to respond to a household canvass or not provide information to an Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) is a criminal offence punishable by a £1000 fine and which leaves you with a criminal record. The government does not propose any extension of the existing offence. Instead, the Bill proposes a lesser civil offence, more like a parking fine, where an individual fails to make an application to register to vote. This will provide appropriate encouragement for people to do their civic duty and register to vote. However, it is not our intention to see large numbers of people fined, and so there will be safeguards in place to ensure thatEROsare required to take specific steps  to encourage an application and only those who refuse repeated invitations can be fined.

Mark Harper, Minister for Political and Constitutional Reform, said:

We must do everything we can to minimise the risk of fraud and increase trust in our electoral system, while encouraging as many eligible voters as possible to get registered to vote.

Alongside the measures for online registration and to improve the administration of elections, I am confident that the Electoral Registration and Administration Bill will create a fair, robust and efficient system, fit to face the challenges of the 21st century.

As well as preparation for individual electoral registration, there are also provisions in the Bill to increase voter participation, further improve the integrity of our electoral system and ensure that the process underpinning our elections is more robust. The electoral timetable for UK Parliamentary elections will be extended, benefiting postal voters, in particular those overseas and service personnel based abroad, by allowing them more time to receive and return their postal vote.

The Bill is published today, and is announced by a Written Ministerial Statement from the Deputy Prime Minister.

The policies in the Electoral Registration and Administration Bill are:
* a major change to our system of electoral registration - Individual Electoral Registration (IER) - requiring electors to register individually rather than by household
*IERwould be a requirement for any new registrations and for anyone who wants to vote by post or proxy from 2014
* creating a legislative framework to allow alternative channels for registration, such as online registration
* providing for the use of data matching to verify applications, check existing entries in registers and find individuals who do not currently appear on the register
* introducing a civil penalty for those who fail to make an application when required to do so by an Electoral Registration Officer
* extending the electoral timetable for UK Parliamentary elections
* altering the timing of polling place reviews to ensure that reviews are aligned with the 5-yearly cycles of elections
* allowing a jointly-nominated candidate to use an emblem on their ballot paper
* removing the automatic postponement of Parish and Community Council elections to allow combination with other elections
* enabling regulations to be made to place Electoral Registration Officers under a duty to inform electors whose postal votes have been rejected because the postal vote identifiers, for example their signature, did not match those stored on record for that elector
* allowing Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs) to enter polling stations as Police Constables can currently
* giving the Secretary of State or Lord President of the Council the power to withhold or reduce a Returning Officer’s fee for reasons of poor performance upon a recommendation from the Electoral Commission

The new system ofIER: Following the transition toIERpeople will only get onto the register by making an individual application to register. A household form will remain (as will the offence) but returning this form will not lead to registration. An individual will have to make a new individual application to register, in doing so providing personal information (eg date of birth and National Insurance number) that registration officers will verify to establish that the person is genuine. Registration officers will encourage new applications by inviting people to register when they become aware of their existence (through the household form or other means). Once an individual is registered underIERthey will not have to make another application to register until they move address."

The beneficiaries of a new £30 million fund to help transform and modernise local charity support services have been announced today by Nick Hurd, Minister for Civil Society.

More than seventy partnerships of local support and development organisations across England have received grants to transform their services and provide high quality, joined up support to frontline charities.  These projects will also make it easier for organisations to forge better links with local businesses, develop stronger partnerships with local public sector bodies and for people to volunteer.

Minister for Civil Society Nick Hurd said:

This fund is not designed to support ‘business as usual’ - it’s about making things better for the frontline. It’s about supporting organisations with innovative business plans who want to play their part in modernising the landscape of local infrastructure.

One of our main priorities is making it easier to run a charity.  We will ensure that we back the highest quality infrastructure support so that charities get guidance which is local, relevant and enables them to improve their service delivery.

The projects funded by the Transforming Local Infrastructure Fund focus on bringing together different charity support providers to offer high quality local services at lower cost. There will also be new initiatives to make it easier for people to volunteer, help for social entrepreneurs who want to make a difference in their communities, support for charities to take over and run community assets, and initiatives to increase support, donations and gifts in kind from the private sector.

The Transforming Local Infrastructure Fund is being managed by Big Fund, the non-lottery funding operation of the Big Lottery Fund. See theBig Lottery’s list of successful organisations.

Dharmendra Kanani, England Director for the Big Lottery Fund, said:

Transforming Local Infrastructure will provide strategic funding for organisations that support the voluntary and community sector in England.  As a result community organisations and groups will be able to respond more flexibly to an ever-changing funding environment, to plan for the future and become more effective.

Big Lottery Fund is planning a distinct and additional investment in funding support services for voluntary organisations of at least £20 million.  Detailed proposals about their plans will be published during 2012.  It is planned that the majority of this investment will go to frontline voluntary organisations in order to give them greater choice and control over the support services which they need.

NAVCA (National Association for Voluntary and Community Action) has offered to work with any area which has not been awarded a grant from the Transforming Local Infrastructure Fund to explore alternative approaches and sources of support for fulfilling the activities set out in their proposals."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/taxpayers-get-more-for-their-money-on-construction-projects,Press release,Taxpayers get more for their money on construction projects,"Radical changes to public sector construction will lead to up to a 20% fall in the cost of building schools, hospitals and roads.",Cabinet Office,10 February 2012,"Radical changes to public sector construction will lead to up to 20 per cent fall in costs of building schools, hospitals and roads

For every pound of public money spent on construction, the Government will deliver up to 20 per cent more by 2015 because of its smarter approach to building public projects, Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude announced today.

New data published today reveals that departments have already saved £188 million on construction contracts placed in the past 18 months, and sets out how the Government will reduce these costs even further over the next three years. The data shows that the costs of building projects such as schools and hospitals are set to fall by 15 to 20%. These reductions are part of the Government’s ambitious five year construction strategy, which takes a long term approach, including a relentless focus on waste, greater transparency on costs, new models of procurement designed to foster collaboration and innovation, and smarter use of technology.

The Government has already published its forecasted spend on construction up to 2015, setting out plans for around £8 billion worth of projects in each of the next three financial years. Today’s cost data will not reduce the overall amount to be invested in construction but will mean that taxpayers will get more for this money. Successfully delivering projects at 15 to 20 % less than the historic benchmark, while holding to its budget, will mean that the public sector will be building £1.2 - £1.6 billion worth more in projects by 2015 - equivalent to approximately 60 new secondary schools.

The published data will provide a standard average cost for projects that the public sector will use to set budgets, making value for money a clear driver in launching projects, and challenging industry to “beat the benchmark”. For example, it shows that in the period up to and including 2009/10, on average it cost:

Minister for the Cabinet Office, Francis Maude, said:

Over the next few years taxpayers will get much more bang for their buck when it comes to construction. We will keep investing in the construction industry, which is vital for growth, and which sustains thousands of SMEs, but we want to stamp out wasteful variation in costs and help to create a stronger cost lead for the industry.

Publishing this data on costs will give the public sector a vital planning and bargaining tool as well as setting a challenge to the industry. Setting out clear costs to industry challenges construction firms to innovate and come up an idea that offers both lower cost and better value.

This efficiency will not only lead to more new builds for taxpayers, it will help to support one of Britain’s vital industries. The construction industry represents 7 % of GDP - almost half of this (40 %) coming from public sector projects. It is also an industry where 99 per cent of companies are SMEs, a major factor in driving growth and employment.

Chief Construction Adviser Paul Morrell said:

Every element of our plans is designed to improve value in public sector construction. I believe we are seeing a fundamental shift in the way the Government relates to the construction industry: in short, getting a more intelligent answer by asking a more intelligent question.

We also need to learn the lessons from projects that go well and apply them consistently to drive out unnecessary cost and waste in the construction process - not just by streamlining processes, but by being more innovative in the way Government approaches its construction programmes.

The Government has started a new relationship with industry that is characterised by openness and collaboration - for example, the Government publishes a regular detailed projection of public sector spend on construction so that the industry can see what is ahead and have confidence to plan accordingly.

The announcements being made today are just part of the long-term drive to get better value out of the public sector construction programme. Detailed actions for making these savings are set out in the Government Construction Strategy published by the Cabinet Office last May, and the Infrastructure Cost Review Implementation Plan published in March 2011.

The Government is also publishing today details on some of the innovative construction delivery and procurement models being trialled in areas such as defence, justice and flood defences."

At the Budapest Conference on Cyberspace Foreign Secretary, William Hague, and Minister for Cyber Security in the Cabinet Office, Francis Maude, will today announce that the UK will establish a centre of excellence on cyber security to offer countries independent and bespoke advice on how to build secure and resilient cyberspace.

The “Centre for Global Cyber-Security Capacity Building” which, will also be backed by £2m and will draw on the expertise generated by the UK’s network of eight universities conducting world class research on this vital issue, is designed to improve international co-ordination, increase access to expertise, and promote good governance online. It will act as a forum to draw together leading thinking and initiatives from across the world including from think tanks and the private sector.

Speaking ahead of the Conference the Foreign Secretary said:

As the digital divide is closing, cyber threats are increasing. Some countries lack the infrastructure and expertise to police their cyberspace and we have been too slow to share best practice and build their capacity. Cyber criminals and terrorists should have no refuge online, just as they should have no sanctuary off-line.

The UK is therefore developing a centre of excellence and providing £2m a year to offer countries independent and bespoke advice on how to address this challenge. This practical initiative will help ensure that we make better use of the skills and resources available internationally. In an interconnected and interdependent world, it is only by ensuring the security of others that we can protect our own networks and our ability to log-on safely. It is in all our interests.

The initiative will complement the UK’s investment in a range of multilateral partners and projects including the Council of Europe, ITU and Commonwealth Cybercrime Initiative, ensuring that money spent across the world by international organisations, governments and industry hits criminals hard.

Francis Maude, Minister for Cyber Security in the Cabinet Office said:

I am delighted to be in Budapest to enhance our already strong international relationship with partners on cyber security. Faced with a threat that knows no geographical boundaries it’s clear we need to team up globally if we are to tackle it. Protecting ourselves from cyber threats is only ever a partial solution. It matters that those with whom we connect are secure too.

The establishment of the Centre for Global Cyber-Security Capacity Building is another example of our commitment to international cooperation and desire to partner with academia and the private sector to ensure that initiatives are more accessible as our cyber-security skills grow.

Today with over two billion people online - and billions more set to join them in the next decade - we are all stakeholders in the internet and must all invest in its successful future. Today’s challenge is to ensure we can keep on enjoying its wonders - by ensuring that all countries can protect themselves from cyber threats. The quicker that cyber-security capacity can grow globally, the faster our online community become more secure.

The Centre for Global Cyber-Security Capacity Building will be an international resource. It will provide a credible source of information and an overview of the scope and effectiveness of national, international and private sector contributions on capacity building. And will aim to develop leading thinking and best practice on driving the global supply of sustainable, inclusive capacity building.

The Centre will be based out of the existing UK academic Centres of Excellence on Cyber-Security but act as an international forum to draw together leading thinking and initiatives of the private sector, governments and international organisations.

He will bring with him invaluable expertise from the business world, as well as significant experience of senior roles in government, both of which will be essential in driving forward tough efficiency measures across Whitehall.

Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude, who co-chairs the board which oversees the Efficiency and Reform Group, said:

It is essential that we move forward as quickly as possible with driving down the cost of government so we can protect the vital public services which the people of this country rely on.

The Efficiency and Reform Group, right at the heart of government, has a crucial role in making sure this starts to happen straight away. I believe that Ian Watmore has the right combination of high-level commercial experience both in commerce and Whitehall to get going straight away on work to deliver a whole raft of savings I know we can achieve across government.

Mr Watmore said:

I am delighted to be coming back to the Civil Service at this critical time to take up this opportunity. I believe that the Efficiency and Reform Group has a key role to play in securing value for money. By looking at innovative new ways of working we can make government more efficient and effective, as well as improving the delivery of public services.

Ian Watmore will start immediately but will formally take up the post on 1 September after he has cleared his current commitments. Between now and then he will spend time with Ministers and key leaders of the Efficiency and Reform Group in order to maintain momentum on this important agenda.

Ian Watmore will be paid £142,500.

The government has committed to make immediate savings of £6.2 billion. For further details on the government’s efficiency and reform drive please seewww.hm-treasury.gov.uk.

The Efficiency and Reform Board is chaired jointly by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and the Minister for the Cabinet Office. For further details please seewww.cabinetoffice.gov.uk.

Ian Watmore began his career in Andersen Consulting (later Accenture) in 1980. In IT and management consultancy, Ian worked on many of their largest business transformation client engagements globally, and ultimately chaired their global Diamond Client Forum.  In 2000 Ian was elected as the youngest ever Managing Director of Andersen Consulting UK by the UK leadership team which covered the transition to Accenture.  In 2004 Ian joined the Civil Service. His first role was as Director General and Government Chief Information Officer in the Cabinet Office before moving in 2006 to lead the Prime Minister’s Delivery Unit at No 10. In 2007, Ian became Permanent Secretary for the newly created Department of Innovation, Universities and Skills where he helped design and build a new government department whilst delivering major policies for the nation. Ian’s most recent role was as Group Chief Executive of the Football Association group, from which he resigned in March 2010.

The Government Property Unit - part of the Cabinet Office’s Efficiency and Reform Group - worked with DFID to secure an early exit from a lease on the 160,000 sq. ft. office at 1 Palace Street. The office will be vacated next year and the department will move into freehold space at 22/26 Whitehall. 22/26 Whitehall was used by the Cabinet Office but from 2010 staff were moved into space shared with HM Treasury on 1 Horse Guards Road.

This move is another example of the work of the Efficiency and Reform Group to drive savings from the civil estate by consolidating departments into the government’s freehold space, selling unnecessary buildings and where possible breaking leases on underused offices. Since May 2010 the government has reduced the running cost of its estate by over £350 million, exiting over 1,070 buildings across the country. Just last month the iconic Admiralty Arch was leased raising £60 million and saving the running costs for what was a vacant building.

Francis Maude said:

For too long government departments were allowed to lease properties at taxpayers’ expense with absolutely no central coordination. In May 2010 government departments occupied 115 different properties just in Bristol.

The Efficiency and Reform Group is making sure government works as one to use the freehold property it already owns more efficiently rather than leasing expensive vanity offices. We’re sharing space, drawing on the best-practice of the private sector, and we now publish information on how departments use their property so armchair auditors everywhere can scrutinise what we are doing and hold us to account.

Since May 2010 we’ve saved over £640 million for taxpayers through our property reforms but there’s much more we can do to drive further savings. Last month we leased Admiralty Arch raising another £60 million and DFID leaving 1 Palace Street will save a further £62.5 million. It’s this non-stop commitment to saving money that puts us on track to save £8 billion this year.

Commenting on her department’s move, Justine Greening, Secretary of State for International Development, said:

Moving to a smaller government-owned building will save DFID £62.5 million by 2020.

As well as saving money, the move will use space more efficiently and put us at the forefront of the government’s plan to reduce the cost of delivering public services. Moving to the heart of Whitehall will mean we can work much more closely with the Foreign Office and other departments to deliver UK policy around the world.

Eyal Rabinovitz of Delek Global Real Estate said:

This is one of a number of exciting projects we are currently working on and we are delighted to have reached an agreement that enables the government to extricate itself from considerable lease obligations. The deal also sets up the possibility of a major project in a prime location.

In anticipation of gaining vacant possession, we are now looking at plans for 1-3 Buckingham Gate, with a view to submitting a planning application in due course. Because of the property’s superb location, all options are being considered.

Delek Global Real Estate report that they are considering redevelopment of 1 Palace Street to create residential property with one of the most prestigious addresses in the world. This project would boost London’s construction industry and generate revenue for Westminster Council through planning payments, none of which could happen had government sat on the property."

The strategy aims to ensure everyone has a fair opportunity to fulfil their potential, regardless of the circumstances of their birth.

The business compact builds onEvery Business Commits, working to remove barriers to success. This is good for us all, stopping talent and potential from being wasted and creating a more productive, more mobile society.

The social mobility business compact calls on businesses to commit to:

1) Support communities and local schools

2) Improve skills and create jobs by providing opportunities for all young people to get a foot on the ladder

3) Improve quality of life and wellbeing by recruiting openly and fairly, ensuring non-discrimination

The Deputy Prime Minister said:

The true test of fairness is equality of opportunity. That is why improving social mobility - giving people a chance to do better - is, alongside reducing the deficit and creating growth, one of the coalition’s key priorities.

The fact is, workplaces across Britain desperately need to be opened up. Too often it’s who you know, not what you know, that counts.

That’s why, as part of the social mobility strategy, we have set up a business compact which commits businesses to opening their doors to give people the break they need.

The principles behind the compact are simple: fairness, opportunity, investing a little more time in the next generation — your future workforce.

I am delighted that so many of the country’s biggest organisations and employers have already signed up to these important principles. I want to encourage every major employer in the country to join too.

The report also includes ideas the team is working on alongside government departments to reduce public sector fraud and error.

The early successes have led to widespread interest in applying behavioural approaches across government.

Oliver Letwin, Minister for government policy, said:

Changing people’s behaviour doesn’t always require new legislation and regulations - some of the most effective approaches tend to involve only small tweaks to government processes, such as letters or forms.

Behavioural insights will not replace existing forms of policy making, but this report shows there is overwhelming evidence that they can save taxpayers’ money and people’s lives.

The Behavioural Insights Team was set up by the government in July 2010 to find innovative and cost-effective ways to change people’s behaviour. It is the first of its kind in the world.

Alongside the launch of the £65 million fund, the government is today publishing a review the not-for-profit social welfare advice sector in England.

These pioneers show that giving frontline staff ownership and power to make decisions can lead to better, more efficient public services.

The event was hosted by the Cabinet Office in partnership with the Employee Ownership Association and South East Councils. It was targeted at Local Authority commissioners, the professionals who decide how services are delivered and award contracts for outsourced services. Attendees had the chance to hear from successful case studies and attend workshops with national policy experts - inspiring a future generation of exciting mutuals.

Minister for the Cabinet Office, Francis Maude, said:

It’s easy to make the case for giving frontline staff the power to do their jobs in the way they know best. The evidence is clear that mutuals deliver many benefits. But we want to make sure that these dedicated public servants have all the support they need. That’s why we organised today’s event to help local commissioners understand how best to support ambitious frontline staff, and to make sure the opportunity to grow the number of mutuals in the South East is not missed.

Speakers at the event included Iain Hasdell, Chief Executive Officer, Employee Ownership Association, Derek Irvine, Director of Commercial Services, West Sussex County Council and Ros Parker, Chief Executive Officer, Aspire Sussex Ltd. Aspire Sussex Ltd successfully span out of West Sussex County Council, harnessing the strength of its staff to offer the same high quality services as a staff run social enterprise, and is one of the mutual case studies that was highlighted at today’s event. It meets the needs of 14,000 students across the county and is the only adult learning provider that delivers qualification courses, family learning, skills for life and community learning across the whole of West Sussex.

West Sussex County Council Director of Commercial Services Derek Irvine said:

West Sussex County Council was supportive and encouraging of the unit’s ambition to operate and trade at arm’s length from the County Council and believed they had the capability to make a real go of it and broaden their offering to the residents of West Sussex and possibly beyond.

These are exciting times for Aspire Sussex Limited and I look forward to watching the organisation develop over the coming years and wish them every success for the future.

Aspire Sussex Ltd has recently received a £70,000 boost from the Cabinet Office Mutual Support Programme (MSP). This money is helping them to receive specialist business support from Mouchel Management Consulting Ltd, in partnership with SCA Group and Turning Point.

Patrick Burns, John Niland and Craig Dearden-Phillips, from the new Mutuals Ambassadors team, which is dedicated to helping fledgling mutuals on the ground, also attended.

Ros Parker, Chief Executive, Aspire Sussex Ltd said:

Aspire Sussex is the first adult education service to spin out as a mutual. Even in its early stages staff are seeing the benefits through improving the way services are delivered and having more say in the services they run.

We are looking forward to new opportunities, greater freedoms and the ability to grow local adult education that makes a difference to people and communities.

There is a wealth of support available to anyone who wants to find out more or develop a mutual through the Mutual Information Service website or by accessing expert advice through the Mutual Information Service hotline.

The government is supporting public servants who want to form mutuals with a £10 million Mutual Support Programme,Mutual Information Service websiteand dedicated hotline on 0845 5390543.

The Mutual Support Programme is helping fledgling mutuals to develop by providing the professional expertise and advice that they are unable to access. The money has been used to buy suppliers to deliver the support these upcoming mutuals need, allowing the government to negotiate the best deals, and build a valuable knowledge sharing database. The programme will also allow government to build a strong evidence base of what works and what doesn’t for other upcoming mutuals that are coming through the system.

Mutuals Ambassadorshave been appointed to support entrepreneurial frontline staff as they form mutuals and to trouble shoot making sure these fledgling businesses can compete for business on a level playing field.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hepatitis-c-deaths-fall-by-16-per-cent-between-2015-and-2017,Press release,Hepatitis C deaths fall by 16 per cent between 2015 and 2017,Deaths from serious hepatitis C related liver disease fell by 16.1% between 2015 and 2017 according to data from PHE.,Public Health England,9 April 2019,"Deaths from serious hepatitis C related liver disease fell from 380 to 319, thanks to new curative treatments. But while England has exceeded the World Health Organization’s (WHO) target to reduce hepatitis C related mortality by 10% by 2020, challenges still exit to eliminate the disease in this country.

Thesenew datawere announced today (9 April 2019) at thePHEResearch and Science Conference.PHEis urging those who may have been at risk of contracting hepatitis C, especially if they have ever injected drugs, to get tested.

As well as the fall in hepatitis C deaths, greater access to new curative treatments is also linked to a reduction in the number of people with the disease requiring liver transplants. In 2017, registrations for a liver transplant due to hepatitis C fell to a 10-year low of 63, a 53% decrease compared to pre-2015 levels.

Challenges remain if we are to meet theWHO’s target of eliminating hepatitis C by 2030 at the latest, with 113,000 people estimated to be living with chronic hepatitis C in England in 2018.

Estimates indicate that up to 79,000 people are currently living with undiagnosed active hepatitis C infection. This is because people with the infection often have no specific symptoms until their liver has been significantly damaged and so are unaware they are infected. When symptoms do occur, they can often be mistaken for other conditions.

Dr Helen Harris, Senior Scientist atPHE, said:

Hepatitis C infection can have devastating consequences, so the fact that more people are accessing treatment and fewer people are dying from the disease, is a huge and very welcome step forward. Yet, more needs to be done if we are to eliminate this disease as a major public health threat in England. Over a hundred thousand people in this country are thought to be living with this serious infection, and we know that significant numbers of them are unaware they are infected.

Anyone who may be at risk of infection, in particular those who have ever injected drugs, even if they injected only once or in the past, should get tested. Given that new treatments provide a cure in around 95% of those who take them, there has never been a better time to get tested.

In 2018,PHEand NHS England launched anational exerciseto identify and treat patients who have been diagnosed with hepatitis C in the past but who may not have cleared their infections. The NHS is in the process of contacting these patients to offer testing, so those with current infection can be referred for assessment for treatment.

Professor Graham Foster, NHS national clinical lead for the Hepatitis C networks, said:

NHS England has invested several hundred million pounds to cure thousands of people with hepatitis C, resulting in dramatic progress on saving lives and reducing the number of liver transplants.

And, with support from drug manufacturers, there is now a real opportunity to eliminate hepatitis C in England before the World Health Organization’s goal of 2030.

Rachel Halford, Chief Executive at the Hepatitis C Trust said:

It is encouraging to see deaths from hepatitis C-related liver disease falling as more patients access DAA treatments. It is, however,  essential that we work to find the estimated 40 to 50% of patients who remain undiagnosed and support them to access treatment services – to stop unnecessary deaths and ensure we reach elimination of hepatitis C by 2030 at the latest. Anyone who thinks they may have been at risk of transmission should get tested – The Hepatitis C Trust website hosts a simple quiz which can tell you whether you may have been at risk.

Hepatitis C is spread through blood-to-blood contact, most commonly in England by sharing needles contaminated with the virus, but even sharing razors or toothbrushes with an infected person could pass on the virus. If untreated, infection with hepatitis C can lead to liver damage, cancer and death. If people aren’t sure about whether they are at risk, they can take a short quiz onThe Hepatitis C Trustwebsite to find out if they should get tested.

Hepatitis C (HCV) is a bloodborne virus that is often asymptomatic, and symptoms may not appear until the liver is severely damaged. As a consequence, many individuals with chronic HCV infection remain undiagnosed and fail to access treatment. These individuals can then present late with complications of HCV-related end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and cancer, which have poor survival rates.

For further information on symptoms, please visit theNHS website.

There was a 127% increase in treatment in 2017 compared to pre-2015 levels.

Between 2005 and 2014, death registrations for HCV-relatedESLDand hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in England more than doubled, rising from 182 in 2005 to 381 in 2014. Since 2014, however, deaths have been falling, with a fall of 16.3% between 2014 and 2017.

Three years ago, the UK government committed to a joint ambition with 193 other countries to eliminate the disease as a major public health threat by 2030. As well as testing and treatment, prevention through needle and syringe exchange services and opiate substitution therapies need to be sustained to achieve and maintain elimination.

Injecting drugs with unsterile injecting equipment, particularly needles and syringes, can put people at risk of hepatitis C infection, even if they injected only once or twice in the past. Others at risk of hepatitis C include those who have received blood transfusions before September 1991 or blood products before 1986 in the UK. People who originate from countries with a higher prevalence of infection, such as South Asia, are also at risk, often following medical or dental treatment with unsterile equipment."

The ‘nudge unit’ which develops ways to improve public services through individual decision-making has identified public savings of at least £300 million since its launch in 2010.

The methods of the unit, which is formally known as the Behavioural Insights Team, have sparked interest from foreign governments and organisations interested in adopting its cost effective techniques.

The ‘nudge unit’  has already worked successfully on government policy:

The team has now agreed partnerships with the government of New South Wales, Australia and a local housing association and will continue its ground-breaking work across Whitehall.

Announcing the plans, Minister without Portfolio Grant Shapps MP said:

As a government, we’ve led the way in this innovative field.

Behavioural Insight is about giving power back to the individual, encouraging them to think about their choices and how those choices will affect them in the long term.

The work of the unit has improved public services and saved taxpayers’ money so I’m proud that it will be recognised on a global scale.

The Behavioural Insights Team or ‘nudge unit’ will now be able to provide services to other governments and bodies, on a charge-for basis, where there is a clear social purpose.

The unit was set up for an initial period of 2 years in July 2010, with the aim of making services easier to use, encouraging and supporting people to make better choices and saving the taxpayer money.

It was set 3 objectives up to its Sunset Review, which has just concluded. They were:

The review found that the team had met these objectives and the Prime Minister and Cabinet Secretary concluded that on the basis of its success the team should continue to operate, with greater freedoms and flexibilities to respond to the growing demand for the application of behavioural insights, both within and outside government. For example, the team has:

2 pieces of work will shortly commence in partnership with:

The government of New South Wales, Australia, to embed insights from behavioural sciences across a range of public policy priorities; and Freebridge Housing Association, to use behavioural sciences in the development of housing in Kings Lynn.

Since 2010, the Unit has achieved savings of more than 20 times its cost and identified specific interventions that will save at least £300 million over the next 5 years.

Chris Eccles, Director General of the New South Wales Department for Premier and Cabinet said:

We’re delighted to be working in partnership with the Behavioural Insights Team to promote the greater application of behavioural insights in New South Wales. We are enthusiastic about the opportunity to improve service delivery and reduce the impact of regulation by enabling people to make better choices for themselves.

Tony Hall, Chief Executive of Freebridge Community Housing, said:

The regeneration of Hillington Square is a huge project for us, our tenants and the wider community and will transform this well-known estate for the benefit of existing and future tenants.

We are committed to bringing sustainable and significant change not only to the buildings but also to the community, encouraging people to live and behave well within Hillington Square. To support us to do this, we are delighted to have enlisted the services of the Cabinet Office’s Behavioural Insights Team.

The Behavioural Insights Team is a world leader in its field. Its members are experts whose knowledge on this subject is second to none and we want to learn from the team and gain their insight into this project.

We believe that our tenants deserve the best which is why we are looking forward to working with the team that we believe is the best in this field. We very much look forward to working with the team and delivering a programme which will change behaviours within Hillington Square.

Speaking at the Institute for government in London today (9 September 2010), Mr Clegg said that decisions such as those to balance the public finances may be painful in the short term but were necessary to create a more sustainable economy in the future.

Read theDeputyPM’s full speech

His speech was 1 of 2 which will set out the government’s guiding purposes. Prime Minister David Cameron is set to make the other speech, on redistributing power from central government to local communities and people, at a future date.

Mr Clegg said that society as a whole and politicians in particular were guilty of “short-termism”.

He said the government was already trying to change this culture through measures such as 5-year economic plans and the Parlimentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill. The Comprehensive Spending Review in October will also be a long term plan, Mr Clegg added.

TheDPMsaid:

I am under no illusions about the significant political risks both parties in the coalition are now taking by now facing up to these difficult decisions in government. But I also think people will see, even through these tough times, that the coalition government is acting in the interests of a better future.

Denying the need to sort out the public finances would lead to bigger problems in the longer term, and would be a betrayal of the prospects and prosperity of future generations. We have had a budget for the future; our Spending Review is aimed squarely at the future too.

It falls to our political generation to take the necessary steps now for a better, fairer future. Reform and change today is necessary if we want mobility and prosperity tomorrow. That’s the horizon shift we need. That’s what the coalition government is about."

People will be given the opportunity to make donations to charity at 12,000 cash machines (ATMs) across the UK this summer, Nick Hurd, Minister for Civil Society, announced today.

Ministers have been looking at new ways to make it easier for people to give small amounts of money to charity. They have been working with cash machine operator LINK to ensure that cash points can start offering people the opportunity to donate to charity in time for the 2012 Olympics. With an influx of people visiting the UK this summer, the Government is keen to give them every opportunity to support worthy causes when they wish to.

Charity donations will be made possible at all 12,000 ATMs belonging to Royal Bank of Scotland and cash machine operator Bank Machine this summer, which is already being heralded as the ‘summer of social action’. The country will be united in celebrating the Diamond Jubilee and London 2012 Olympic & Paralympic Games, with many people volunteering and organising street parties for their community. The banks taking part in the scheme will nominate a number of charities and people will be able to choose who they support at the cash point.Minister for Civil Society Nick Hurd said:

People in this country have always given generously to worthy causes. We want to make it easier for people to give small amounts to charity if they want to. By making it possible to add donations at cash points we can make an even greater difference to other people’s lives.

It’s important that as a Government we bring public sector bodies, businesses and civil society organisations together to find new ways to support charitable and voluntary action. That’s why later today we are holding a summit so that we can find new ways to support charitable and voluntary action.

Steve Lampshire, Senior Community Affairs Manager Royal Bank of Scotland, said:

We know that finances are tight for many people, but if our customers do want to make a charitable donation we want to make the process as easy as possible. In turn our selected charities will receive a steady income to enable them to carry out their vital community work.

Melanie Knight, Bank Machine’s Director of Communications & Resources, said:

Bank Machine was the first ATM operator to announce its participation in the ATM Charity Giving scheme.  We have received registrations of interest from over 550 charities that wish to take part. We have asked an independent panel to decide which charities will participate as we want to ensure that as many worthy causes as possible are able to take part.

Today’s  announcement comes ahead of the Giving Summit which will take place later today bringing together public sector bodies, business and civil society organisations to discuss how they can work together to make Britain and even more generous country.

The Government has already taken measures to make it easier to give, so that it becomes a part of everyday life. It has, for example, supported measures such as text giving and financed innovative crowd-funding platforms. Through the £10 million Innovation in Giving Fund the Government supports creative ideas so that they can scale up grow and become self-sustaining.

1. The Government identified in the Giving White Paper the potential for ATM giving as a way to facilitate and promote giving.

2. The Government has been working with LINK to encourage the development of such facilities. This has led to charity giving will be possible at selected cash machines (ATMs) over the summer.

3. At a first phase charity donations can be made at all 12,000 ATMs belonging to Bank Machine and Royal Bank of Scotland, with other ATM operators will follow on later in 2012 and into 2013.  This service will be initially available to selected LINK card-holders.

4. The Government will invest over £40m in volunteering and social action over the next two years - we have already invested in excess of £23m in the last year through the Social Action and Innovation in Giving funds.

5. Government has also promoted giving through a number of match funding initiatives, including street smart, text Santa, and localgiving, a total of £1.2m of government funds have leveraged equivalent private donations.

6. Community First, a large scale match funding programme (£80m) is already in place and reaching some of most deprived communities in the country.  Over 100 senior Community Organisers are already deployed to listen and spark social action in communities with low social capital.

7. We have also made headway in supporting a change in social norms - 8,000 young people took place in the National Citizen Service last year and civil servants are now actively encouraged to take part in volunteering, with over 26 permanent secretaries already signed up to take part on the speakers for schools initiative.

8. Gift aid will also be available on small donations for the first time from April 2013."

Mr Hague told the Commons one of the effects of increased military activity was that the number of incidents involving Afghan and international ISAF forces, particularly where shots had been fired at them, had “increased sharply”.

The Foreign Secretary also said progress in Afghanistan remains the “top foreign policy priority for the Government”.

The statement delivered by Mr Hague was the first in a series of regular updates where ministers will come to the Commons to deliver quarterly progress reports.

Under the Tenant Cashback Scheme, responsible residents will have the chance to tackle everyday DIY dilemmas like leaky taps, fitting doors and painting and decorating.

Those who sign up to the scheme could not only receive cash for their efforts - those who get a taste for DIY could also get on the career ladder with the opportunity of basic training programmes to help them develop their skills even further.

Mr Shapps said the Tenant Cashback scheme offers the opportunity:

Today, the Minister met with councils and housing associations across the country, and urged them not to deny their tenants the opportunity for a fulfilling career - which could start in the comfort of their own homes.

Some landlords are already leading the way. These include:

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

Rather than having to wait for landlords to act, tenants should be able to tackle their own DIY dilemmas and get paid for it.

Tenant Cashback offers just that opportunity, with as much as £500 a year available to residents who sign up to tackle such minor repairs as leaky taps and decorating. And for some, this could even serve as an apprenticeship in the home and the start on a path to a whole new career.

This, combined with the potential to bring the local community together to improve the local area, means all councils and housing associations should give residents the right to take up tools through this new scheme.

Social housing landlords are responsible for more than four million homes, and spend an average of £1,000 per property annually on repairs.

Tenant Cashback allows residents to take more control of their repairs budgets for their homes, for example, by carrying out their own DIY or commissioning it locally - allowing them to pocket any savings made which can then be used as they see fit, such as towards the deposit on their own house.

At a meeting today in central London Mr Maude and Minister for Energy and Climate Change Greg Barker urged UK’s leading facilities management companies to work under the terms of a new Energy Efficiency Code. This meeting followed the Prime Minister’s pledge on 14 May to cut central government carbon emissions by 10% in one year to help protect the environment and save money.

The event was attended by senior representatives from major contractors which maintain government buildings. These companies also outlined how they can share best practice on saving energy use and what can be achieved in pursuit of this goal.

The government’s new Energy Efficiency Code states that all departments should:

In response, contractors are asked to share their expertise with public bodies and actively identify opportunities to reduce energy emissions.

Mr Maude said:

In this fiscal crisis, it is essential that we take radical steps to increase efficiency and reduce energy use. This saves money and helps to cut the deficit, but it also helps to protect our environment. The public sector as a whole is responsible for 3% of UK carbon emissions and spends more than £2.5 billion on energy every year, so there is a huge potential to make a real difference.

This government is determined to tackle waste wherever it exists, and that includes energy use. To achieve results central government departments need to work with contractors to identify waste and share best practice.

Central to the drive for greater efficiency is transparency. If people can see how much energy departments are using then government’s energy use is under more scrutiny. In achieving this goal I want to harness the experience and innovation of the private sector so that we can share practical solutions to saving energy.

Mr Barker said:

As the Prime Minister announced when he took office, we are determined to make this the greenest government ever. The coalition is leading by example with our pledge to reduce carbon emissions from government buildings by 10% this year. Civil servants and building managers will need to work closely together to cut carbon and reduce waste.

To help forge a close working relationship between civil servants and building managers the Office of Government Commerce’s Centre of Expertise in Sustainable Procurement has been bringing together the best of private sector practice in saving energy and encouraging Government departments to emulate their successes. In addition, to encourage better energy use the Office of Government Commerce has produced new guidance for government departments and facilities management suppliers."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/eric-pickles-gives-councils-back-the-freedom-to-pray--2,News story,Eric Pickles gives councils back the freedom to pray,Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles today (18 February 2012) gave local councils a major new power that will allow town halls to continue…,"Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (2018 to 2021) and The Rt Hon Lord Pickles",17 February 2012,"Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles today (18 February 2012) gave local councils a major new power that will allow town halls to continue to hold prayers.

Local councils now have a power that should enable them to continue to include prayers as part of the formal business at council meetings, if they wish, and thereby maintain the common practice in council meetings across the country.

This responds to last week’s High Court ruling against Bideford Town Council based on an interpretation of Section 111 of the Local Government Act 1972 rather than on equality or human rights grounds. It judged that councils did not have the powers to hold prayers as part of formal business.

This major new legal power is contained in the Coalition Government’s Localism Act 2011, which creates a ‘general power of competence’ that will allow councils to legally do anything an individual could do unless specifically prohibited by law. This should give councils that want to continue holding formal prayers the confidence and legal standing to do so.

Mr Pickles has fast-tracked and personally signed a Parliamentary Commencement Order so the new power can be exercised by all major local authorities in England from today and following due Parliamentary process for parishes by April.

Today’s intervention builds on the speech by the Prime Minister in Christ Church, Oxford, in December, where he asserted: “We are a Christian country and we should not be afraid to say so”. It also follows the official Ministerial delegation to the Holy See this week led by Cabinet Minister, Baroness Warsi; in her speech, she criticised the intolerance of “militant secularisation”.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

The High Court judgement has far wider significance than just the municipal agenda of Bideford Town Council. For too long, faith has been marginalised in public life, undermining the very foundations of the British nation.

As a matter of urgency I have personally signed a Parliamentary order to bring into force an important part of the new Localism Act - the general power of competence - that gives councils the vital legal standing that should allow them to continue to hold formal prayers at meetings where they wish to do so.

This should effectively overtake the ruling and it also shows that greater localism can give local councils the strength and freedom to act in their best interests.

We will stand for freedom to worship, for Parliamentary sovereignty, and for long-standing British liberties.

New data published today shows that £15 million has been saved in this financial year (2011 to 2012), by limiting performance related pay bonuses to top performers, while spend on Government Procurement Cards has been cut by around £45 million between 2009 to 2010 and 2010 to 2011.

The data also shows a significant fall in the number of consultants. In 2009 to 2010 the government spent £1.4 billion on consulting. In 2010 to 2011 this spend fell to £500 million, a reduction of 70% or £870 million.

For the first time ever taxpayers will be able to scrutinise a range of data, including:

All data can be accessed ondata.gov.uk.

Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office said:

Today’s releases show just how serious we were when we said we were determined to become a world leader in transparency.  Like previous releases today’s datasets onGPC, performance related pay and monthly workforce information are unprecedented and will give the public another way of scrutinising how government spends its money and holding us to account.

But what today’s data also shows is how seriously the Civil Service have taken their role in helping us to drive out waste at the very heart of government and get a grip on expenditure.

We said that we would reduce spend on Government Procurement Cards and today we have the evidence. In the last year spend on these cards has been cut by around 10% across government. We said we would reform performance management and we can now reveal we have saved £15 million by cutting back on performance payments made to senior staff. This is not the end - we will leave no stone unturned in our bid to save the taxpayer money.

Notes to editors:

The Government Procurement Card (GPC) is a payment charge card, designed to be settled in full at the end of each month. Government will always have to make purchases andGPCallows all levels of public sector workers to pay for low value items in a low-cost, secure and efficient way.

The use ofGPCgreatly speeds up the circulation of cash in the economy and allows suppliers to be paid much more quickly - this has been particularly beneficial for small and medium enterprises with cash flow problems caused by late payments.  We have recently strengthened the guidance on using the cards.

Cross-governmentGPCspend:

Non-consolidated Performance Related Payments are one-off, non-pensionable awards that are made to individuals to reward high performance against objectives or for specific tasks. Such payments to senior staff for 2010 to 2011 performance have been restricted to the top 25% of performers only, down from 65%, delivering savings of around £15 million. We have also sharpened the performance management system that underpins such payments.

The monthly information on workforce provides an insight into how many people are employed in each department and their pay bill for April to August 2011.

The government’s commitment to publish all spend over £25,000 continues with the next set of data released today.

Central government, excluding the Ministry of Defence, report a further reduction in consultants on headcount from 700 in March 2011 to 400 in July of the same year - a further 40% reduction.

Speaking at today’s (1 November 2010) Summit for Small Business, which was hosted by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, Francis Maude announced a number of steps being taken by the Cabinet Office to help the government achieve its ambition to award 25% of government contracts toSMEs.

The new measures are designed to address head-on the areas thatSMEshave consistently highlighted as the biggest barriers to doing business with the public sector. Key measures include plans to:

Mr Maude said:

We believe small businesses and social enterprises have a vital role to play in the growth of the UK economy and often they will be the most flexible, the quickest to respond and the most imaginative. That is why we are committed to making it easier for these organisations to compete for government business.

Today’s package of measures announced by the Cabinet Office will help to remove the barriers many small businesses face and eliminate complexities and waste in the procurement process.  They will also ensure we are on our way to hitting our aspiration that 25% of government contracts go to small and medium enterprises.

Across the sector many major suppliers already signalled their strong support for today’s announcement, particularly the measures to ensure the passing on of 30 day payment to subcontractors working on government business.

At the end of the day we’re seeking a ‘win-win’ - more business toSMEsas an engine of the economy and better value for the good of the public purse.

Further measures being introduced by the Cabinet Office include:

As set out in the coalition programme, the aspiration is for 25% of government contracts to go toSMEs.

The major suppliers which have already signalled their support for the measures to ensure the passing on of 30 day payment include:"
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/civil-service-graduate-fast-stream-opens-with-new-structured-career-path,Press release,Civil Service Graduate Fast Stream opens with new structured career path,"On 17 September 2012, the Civil Service Fast Stream will once again open for applications.",Cabinet Office,17 September 2012,"17 September 2012CAB 094-12

On 17 September 2012, the Civil Service Fast Stream will once again open for applications.

As part of the civil service reform plan, this year sees the introduction of a more structured career path with improved career development and management to the Graduate Fast Stream scheme. These changes will have a key role to play in strengthening the capability of the service, equipping Fast Streamers with a wider range of skills and experiences across multiple departments and sectors.

The Civil Service Fast Stream is a talent management programme for the country’s brightest graduates who demonstrate the potential to become future leaders of the Civil Service. It is consistently ranked in the top ten of The Times Top 100 Graduate Employers.

To mark the opening of the competition, Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood will host a live Q&A session on Facebook on 20 September. This will give anyone interested in applying the opportunity to get thoughts and advice on a career in the Civil Service from the Prime Minister’s most senior policy adviser.

The Fast Stream enables graduates to make a real impact on people’s lives in the UK and the wider world, working in areas such as education, the economy, foreign affairs, defence policy, health, the environment and many more.

Responsibility will come quickly to successful applicants, who will spend their first two years building up broad experience in four relatively short placements in contrasting roles. This new structure will give Fast Streamers the opportunity to experience front-line service delivery (for example, managing a court or Jobcentre, or working on border control), and management of people, projects and finance, as well as roles in the development and implementation of government policies. In their second two years, Fast Streamers will gain more in-depth experience in two 12-month postings.

The Fast Streamers’ careers will be monitored and facilitated by newly appointed Talent Managers based in Civil Service Resourcing, the organisation introduced last year to provide a complete human resourcing solution for the Civil Service.

Gillian Smith, Director of Civil Service Resourcing, said:

This is a milestone in the history of the Fast Stream. The new learning and development package, and improved talent management arrangements, have clear benefits for the Civil Service and for Fast Streamers themselves.

Sir Jeremy Heywood said:

The Fast Stream continues to be an incredibly valuable source of new talent and provides the Civil Service with the means to recruit its leaders of the future.

Fast Streamers will have a unique opportunity to work on a wide variety of government policies and initiatives, helping to get the economy moving and driving forward the government’s extensive reform agenda, covering schools, the NHS, the criminal justice system and other public services.

I am looking forward to having an engaging chat with interested candidates on 20th September and hope to encourage as many as possible to apply.

Sir Jeremy’s Question and Answer session will take place on Thursday 20 September from 2pm to 3pm atwww.facebook.com/faststream

On a daily basis, the Fast Stream Facebook site offers prospective applicants the chance to chat with serving Fast Streamers for advice and insights on the recruitment process.

Applications will be accepted from 17 September via the Fast Stream website:www.civilservice.gov.uk/faststream. This page also provides more details on the new structure of the Graduate Scheme.

The Fast Stream schemes are:
  * The Graduate Fast Stream is open to graduates of any discipline and is the commonest route to a Fast Stream career in the major government departments. It also includes options for the Diplomatic Service and the Houses of Parliament, and for scientists and engineers.
  * The Analytical Fast Stream offers options for economists, statisticians, social researchers and operational researchers.
  * The HR Fast Stream is for graduates with a proven interest in all areas of the HR profession.
  * The Technology in Business Fast Stream is for graduates who understand and have a strong interest in technology.
  * The European Fast Stream is for graduates seeking a permanent career in the EU institutions in Brussels.
  * The Northern Ireland Fast Stream is for graduates wishing to make a career in the Northern Ireland Civil Service.

These changes detailed in this Press Notice apply to the Graduate programme. The other schemes offer well-defined career paths tailored to their particular needs.

Fast Stream recruitment is managed jointly by Civil Service Resourcing and Parity Solutions Ltd, which was recently successful in a mini-tender exercise."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-office-supplies-deal-to-save-government-over-18-million-a-year,Press release,New office supplies deal to save government over £18 million a year,Francis Maude has announced 2 new office supplies contracts expected to deliver savings of over £18 million a year.,Cabinet Office and The Rt Hon Lord Maude of Horsham,4 August 2011,"As part of the continuing drive to maximise the buying power of government, Francis Maude has announced 2 new contracts for office supplies which are expected to deliver savings of over £18 million a year.

All central government departments will now use the new centrally managed deal for Office Supplies and will pay the same price for items such as pens and paper, bringing to an end the days where departments pay different prices for the same items. A significant number of wider public sector organisations also decided to participate in this tender exercise.

Savings of between 12-29% are expected with the 2 new Office Supplies contracts which will be managed by HMRC on behalf of government procurement. The number of catalogue line items has been rationalised from 15,000 to 3,500 with scope to reduce this even further and generate more savings. The suppliers will be incentivised to work with government departments to identify further items to remove and further rationalise the list.

The new contracts will make available environmentally friendly, recycled stationery and toners, and for the first time ever, the unique “Closed Loop” recycling solution. This contract will be used across all central government departments providing secure document shredding and enabling them to recycle and reuse their own waste paper. The “Closed Loop” solution is already used by HMRC and The Ministry of Justice and is expected to reduce their paper costs by £500,000 per annum.

Francis Maude said:

These contracts will bring an end to the ludicrous practice of one department buying office equipment at one price whilst another buys the same items at a totally different price - all central government departments and quite a few public authorities will buy through this contract. I know it’s not glamorous to talk about savings made by procuring pens and paper, but centralising our procurement in areas like this will save the government, and therefore taxpayers millions of pounds.

“The contracts will not only deliver significant savings but environmental benefits too by ensuring government departments move to using recycled paper and recycled toner cartridges. The Closed Loop initiative makes sense as it will allow us to recycle and re-use our own waste paper.  I’m particularly excited about this, because if we can generate enough business through this model and garner private investment, then the opportunity exists for the creation of a paper recycling mill in the UK, where none exists today.

John Collington, government’s Chief Procurement Officer, said:

These contracts are the first of many we will source and manage of behalf of departments, where government’s buying power is being better leveraged. These results demonstrate the procurement reform strategy is delivering as planned.

David Thomas, Commercial Director of HMRC, (who led the sourcing activity on behalf of Government Procurement), said:

The partnership approach we will take with suppliers will deliver immediate savings by aggregating department volumes through a consolidated supply base as set out within the government’s Efficiency Review. In line with the government’s procurement agenda a significant proportion of the goods and services supplied under this contract will be sourced from UK SMEs.

The office solution contract has been awarded in 2 lots:

Government Procurement, led from the Cabinet Office, will build on existing government-provided operations to deliver sustainable cost savings for central government departments, streamline current procurement processes and invest in civil service procurement staff. This includes negotiating contracts for widely used goods and services for the whole of government at a single, better price, ending the signing of expensive deals by individual departments."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/planning-paperwork-to-be-radically-cut-back-to-help-communities-drive-development,News story,Planning paperwork to be radically cut back to help communities drive development,A radical overhaul of planning policy cutting out thousands of unnecessary central instructions and putting communities at the heart of decision…,"Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (2018 to 2021) and The Rt Hon Greg Clark",21 December 2010,"A radical overhaul of planning policy cutting out thousands of unnecessary central instructions and putting communities at the heart of decision making, has been announced today by Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark.

In recent years, the planning system has become overloaded with central guidance and statements, with vast amounts of paperwork making it too cumbersome for councils, developers and local people to use effectively.

Too much unwanted detail has resulted in a system full of contradictions and has acted as a brake on growth, hindering rather than helping local communities to shape development in their neighbourhoods.

Today Mr Clark is announcing an end to the centralist approach to planning with an ambitious plan designed to consolidate dozens of existing policy statements, circulars and guidance documents into a single national planning policy framework.

The new framework will:

Planning professionals, local authorities, community groups and members of the public will have an opportunity to shape the new framework. Mr Clark is today inviting organisations and individuals to offer their views to the Department on what priorities and policies the Government might adopt to produce the shorter, more decentralised and less bureaucratic national planning policy framework.

Mr Clark said:

We have over 1000 pages of policy and guidance that have made the planning system unclear and burdensome.

This creates vast amounts of paperwork and bureaucracy that burdens developers and limits the power of local people to shape their neighbourhoods around their vision.

The new framework will integrate our current suite of policy statements and guidance into a single concise document. It will focus on the Government’s key priorities for planning and help deliver a more effective, decentralised system.

Today Mr Clark also set out a Work Plan on major infrastructure planning reform to deliver nationally important new infrastructure that will drive economic growth. This includes the steps to be taken to abolish the Infrastructure Planning Commission and drive major planning reform.

Securing investment in new infrastructure is essential to delivering growth over the coming decades. There is expected to be £200 billion of private and public sector investment in infrastructure over the next five years.

Planning decisions on infrastructure of this scale are so important that the Government believes it is right that these decisions should be taken by democratically elected representatives and not by the Infrastructure Planning Commission, an unelected quango.

A new Major Infrastructure Planning Unit, established within the Planning Inspectorate, will take over the IPC’s responsibilities once it is abolished. The new Unit will provide advice to Ministers who will take the decisions on nationally important infrastructure projects and grant permissions.

The Government has committed to making decisions at least as quickly as the twelve months allowed under the major infrastructure planning regime and is considering whether we can reduce the timeframe further.

Mr Clark also confirmed the Government’s commitment to the delivery of critically important National Policy Statements for new infrastructure.  These will set out the Government’s policy on major infrastructure projects such as ports or power stations.

Mr Clark added:

Securing investment in new infrastructure is essential to help rebuild the UK economy and provide new jobs.  We cannot expect to meet the needs of tomorrow with yesterday’s infrastructure and reform of the planning system is vital to securing essential investment and achieving economic growth.

The National Planning Policy Framework will streamline the national planning policies set out in Planning Policy Guidance notes, Planning Policy Statements, Minerals Policy Statements and Minerals Policy Guidance notes, plus a number of related Circulars. There are around 40 such documents.

The guidance notes and statements cover various planning aspects of climate change, housing, renewable energy, flood risk, Green Belt and waste, and procedural advice such as how to compile development plans.

The Government will continue to maintain Green Belt protection, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, National Parks, Sites of Special Scientific Interest and other environmental designations which protect the character of our country’s landscape, stop unsustainable urban sprawl and preserve wildlife.

There are also over 100 advisory guidance notes including best practice guides. These will be cut back. Too much weight is often given to this kind of guidance, especially when many professional bodies produce high quality advisory material that is equal or of more use to users of the planning system.

National Policy Statements, which will set out the Government’s policy on major infrastructure projects such as ports or power stations, will not be included in the Framework.

6. Organisations and individuals will be invited to offer views on priorities and policies that should be included in the new slimlined framework before a draft is produced and available for formal consultation.

For the majority of schemes, decisions will be taken by the Secretary of State responsible for the policy: the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change will take decisions on major energy infrastructure and the Secretary of State for Transport will take decisions on major transport infrastructure.

We envisage that applications relating to hazardous waste will be determined by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, and that applications relating to waste water and water supply will be determined jointly by the Secretaries of State for Communities and Local Government and Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

3. Subject to Royal Assent of the Localism Bill and commencement of relevant legislation, the Infrastructure Planning Commission will be abolished and its functions transferred to the Secretary of State.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/localism-bill-starts-a-new-era-of-people-power,News story,Localism Bill starts a new era of people power,A landmark bill that heralds a ground-breaking shift in power to councils and communities overturning decades of central government control …,"Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (2018 to 2021) and The Rt Hon Lord Pickles",13 December 2010,"A landmark bill that heralds a ground-breaking shift in power to councils and communities overturning decades of central government control was unveiled by Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles today.

The Localism Bill will put an end to the hoarding of power within central government and top-down control of communities, allowing local people the freedom to run their lives and neighbourhoods in their own way.

The Bill, laid before Parliament today, contains a radical package of reforms that will devolve greater power and freedoms to councils and neighbourhoods, establish powerful new rights for communities, revolutionise the planning system, and give communities control over housing decisions.

The legislation will help build the Big Society by radically transforming the relationships between central government, local government, communities and individuals.

For councils the Bill will fundamentally change their freedom to act in the interest of their local communities through a new general power of competence. Rather than needing to rely on specific powers, the new power will give councils the legal reassurance and confidence to innovate, drive down costs to deliver more efficient services.

Eric Pickles said:

The Localism Bill will herald a ground-breaking shift in power to councils and communities overturning decades of central government control and starting a new era of people power.

It is the centrepiece of what this Government is trying to do to fundamentally shake up the balance of power in this country. For too long, everything has been controlled from the centre - and look where it’s got us. Central government has kept local government on a tight leash, strangling the life out of councils in the belief that bureaucrats know best.

By getting out of the way and letting councils and communities run their own affairs we can restore civic pride, democratic accountability and economic growth - and build a stronger, fairer Britain. It’s the end of the era of big government: laying the foundations for the Big Society.

The Localism Bill contains further measures to strengthen local democracy by:

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

This Bill will provide the enduring legislative foundation for a new, decentralised Britain, where power is returned to the people to which it belongs. We believe that communities should have the freedom to manage their own affairs in their way, and be empowered, not suppressed, by Government. The Bill will enact new rights allowing local people to shape and influence the places where they live, revolutionising the planning process by passing power down to those who know best about their neighbourhoods.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps added:

With housebuilding at its lowest peacetime level since 1924, the time is right for radical shake up of the entire system. The Bill will end top-down targets - in their place communities with the vision and drive to build more homes will be given the freedom to achieve their ambitions, and this will be backed up with powerful cash incentives for councils that allow new development in their area.

With five million people languishing on social housing waiting lists, social housing is ripe for reform. Councils will now be able to manage social housing in a way that genuinely meets the needs of local people, and will be able to offer fixed tenancies that give people the helping hand they need, for as long as they need it.

Communities Minister, Andrew Stunell said:

The Localism Bill will pave the way for the long overdue push of powers out of Whitehall to councils and neighbourhoods across the country, and give local communities real control over housing and planning decisions.

Local facilities have been closing down all over the country, leaving towns and villages without vital services.

Small community groups that are willing to take over local assets often find that they lack the time and resources to get a plan together and compete with the might and muscle of big business and developers.

The powerful new rights in the Bill will put real power in the hands of real people, empowering local communities and putting them at the heart of local decision making.

1. Ministers have already started giving councils greater financial freedom, by devolving and streamlining £7 billion more of government funding, removing burdens and bureaucratic controls so that they can prioritise budgets to support public services in ways which meet the priorities of local people and communities, helping to manage demand on services so they are more personalised and effective for vulnerable groups thereby reducing costs to society.

2. The Government also wants to create a new era of accountability and openness where bureaucratic accountability is replaced by democratic accountability. Putting more data in the public domain is central in making this happen and will drive smarter spending.

3. Getting council business out in the open will revolutionise local government and help facilitate the Big Society. Councils are now expected to publish all expenditure over £500 online. Local people should be able to hold their council to account. Greater openness and transparency is absolutely critical to root out waste and inefficiency.

4. General Power of Competence: Local Authorities are creatures of statute - they only have the power to do what Parliament has authorised them to do - unlike a natural person that can do anything except where that power to act is curtailed by law. Since local authorities were first incorporated power has been given to them on a piecemeal basis. Now, with General Power of Competence, local authorities can basically act in that same way as a natural person, except where restricted by statute such as creating a new tax.

5. The Government has today also publishedDecentralisation and the Localism Bill: an essential guide. Its sets out six actions central government will need to take to achieve and maintain the radical shift in power, - in behaviour, expectation, and culture - which must go alongside the changes in law proposed in the Bill.

Government-backed pilots for the scheme will start next summer and will provide around 10,000 places. Aimed at school leavers aged 16, the pilots will take place from June to September, following the end of the exam period, and will last for 7 to 8 weeks.

NCSaims to give every 16 year old the chance to learn new skills that will help them to make a positive contribution to their community.

ThePMsaid:

There is a tragic waste of potential in this country today. The young people of this country are as passionate and idealistic as any generation before - perhaps more passionate. But too many teenagers appear lost and feel their lives lack shape and direction.

National Citizen Service will help change that. A kind of non-military national service, it’s going to mix young people from different backgrounds in a way that doesn’t happen right now. It’s going to teach them what it means to be socially responsible. Above all it’s going to inspire a generation of young people to appreciate what they can achieve and how they can be part of the Big Society.

Activities are expected to include an outdoor challenge, a set of structured tasks involving visiting and helping the local community and developing skills and, in consultation with local communities, designing a social action task.

NCSis a key part of the Big Society agenda, as set out by thePMin Liverpool on Monday, and will involve a programme of activities designed to introduce young people to the concept of civic responsibility as they make the transition into adulthood.

The pilots will bring people from different backgrounds together in a residential and home-based programme of activity.

Participants will spend a minimum of 10 days and nights away from home, to give them the opportunity to develop life skills and resilience and to serve their community.

The government hopes to be able to offer outstandingNCSgraduates the opportunity to take part in a programme of social action projects in developing countries.

Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude said:

We know that across the country many young people are ready to stand up and make a difference to their local community. We seeNCSas key to building a Big Society, to increasing engagement, cohesion and responsibility for young people across the country.

This programme will allow a whole generation of young people to make a difference in their local area and play an active role in making society a better place.

National Citizen Service will:

To mark the announcement thePMand the Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude will meet today with voluntary sector workers and young people who have completed similar programmes. Pooled pictures are available.

The Cabinet Office will work with partners from the youth sector on the details of National Citizen Service, starting with pilots next summer, before the programme is rolled out more widely.

The government will publish a detailed specification for the pilots, inviting potential providers to submit bids, at the beginning of August 2010.  Successful candidates will be announced in late October, at the latest. As with all government programmes, the scale of the pilots will be subject to the Spending Review.

Through the Youth Contract and ongoing Apprenticeships programme there is more support available to employers who want to offer sustainable jobs, training and work experience opportunities to unemployed young people. Ministers want to send a clear signal that this support is available to allVCSEemployers.

At a roundtable discussion with charity leaders, ministers welcomed the support from some of Britain’s biggest charities including Mind, Groundwork and the NSPCC. Membership organisations the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations (ACEVO) and the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) will also encourage their members to consider the opportunities offered by the scheme.

Earlier today Employment Minister Chris Grayling, Apprenticeships Minister John Hayes and Nick Hurd the Minister for Civil Society met with senior charity representatives, to hear from them about how they offer young people work, training and apprenticeships in their organisations and discuss the Youth Contract.

Nick Hurd Minister for Civil Society said:

We must ensure that we harness the energy and innovation of our young people and ensure that they get sustainable jobs with career development opportunities. The government recognises thatVCSEorganisations have unique skills and experience in addressing this important issue. We are engaging the sector to ensure they are given a full opportunity to be involved in this programme.

Minister for Employment Chris Grayling said:

We want to harness the experience from all sectors to make sure we get it right on youth unemployment.  We want young people to enter the labour market with the skills, training and experience required to secure sustainable employment. But we can’t do this alone, that is why today we are meeting with voluntary sector organisations and welcoming them on board with the Youth Contract.

Minister for Apprenticeships John Hayes said:

With the biggest and best apprenticeships programme in our country’s history underway, an unprecedented number of young people are taking these opportunities to build long, fulfilling and productive careers.
Now, we are supporting our leading charities to provide the same gold-standard training in the voluntary sector. This government is committed to raising quality standards and to making it easier for employers across all sectors to take on apprentices, in part by cutting bureaucracy and providing cash incentives.

Paul Farmer, Chief Executive of Mind said:

It is encouraging that ministers recognise the important role of the sector both as an employee and a provider to help young people find and stay in work. The package should give opportunities to disabled young people to start careers.

Sir Tony Hawkhead, CEO of Groundwork UK said:

Take a young person on as an apprentice and you improve their employment prospects instantly.  The future of this country depends on equipping our young people with the right skills now - and giving charities the incentive through the wage subsidy element of the Youth Contract means we can all play our part in doing just that.

Ben Kernighan, Deputy Chief Executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO), said:

Addressing youth unemployment is one of the biggest challenges facing the country. I urge voluntary organisations to consider the opportunities that the youth contract may offer, including taking on apprentices, creating jobs supported by new wage subsidies and providing support to young people not in education, employment or training.

Mark Gibson, Managing Director - BTCV Employment & Skills said:

The New Youth Contract, Work Programme and Growth in Apprenticeships will positively address a need for young people to be economically active and give them hope for their future.  BTCV will be working positively with the Prime Contractors, DWP and SFA to see how it can harness various funding streams to help create employment, improve young people’s long-term employment prospects while delivering green space improvement that is at the heart of what BTCV achieves day in and day out through people of all ages.

Peter Holbrook, Chief Executive of Social Enterprise UK, said:

Our research shows that lots of young people are starting their own social enterprises, many in the UK’s most deprived communities, where jobs are scarce.  Social enterprises also have a strong track record, providing training and jobs to some of those most in need of opportunity and meaningful futures.  We would be delighted to see this government initiative support greater numbers of young people into training and employment.

Stephen Jeffrey, Chief Executive, Fairtrain:

Fairtrain welcomes the initiative presented through the Youth Contract. We look forward to working with ministers to increase the number of people on training and in apprenticeships in the third sector.

Through the Youth Contract, DWP will be providing 160,000 Wage Incentives worth up to £2,275 to employers who recruit 18 to 24-year-olds who are unemployed, claiming benefits and participating in the Work Programme. Employers in the voluntary, charity and social enterprise sector who can offer sustainable jobs to young people will be able to benefit from the Wage Incentive.

The Youth Contract supports the creation of an additional 250,000 work experience places through the Department for Work and Pension’s work experience and sector-based work academies programmes.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/francis-maude-reveals-3-75-billion-in-savings,Press release,Francis Maude reveals £3.75 billion in savings,Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude has today revealed that the government has saved £3.75bn in ten months.,Cabinet Office and The Rt Hon Lord Maude of Horsham,1 August 2011,"Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude has today revealed that the government’s ambitious approach to saving money has delivered a staggering £3.75 billion of cash savings in just ten months, from May 2010 to March 2011.

This follows Francis Maude’s pledge in October last year to leave “no stone unturned” in the hunt for more savings at the centre of government, delivering better for less, to address the deficit while protecting the front line and will help departments live within their tighter budgets.

Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office said,

Today’s figures show that our ambitious targets to cut waste and save money have paid off. To put £3.75 billion into context, it’s equivalent to the salaries of 200,000 junior nurses; or 150,000 secondary school teachers; it could pay for several Whitehall departments; and it’s about the same as the revenue derived from one penny of the basic rate of income tax.

“We promised to drive out inefficiency and unjustifiable costs in central government. It is these savings, which have been achieved in just ten months, that have allowed departments to protect essential front line services and jobs. Following an independent audit, I can confirm today that these measures have saved central government departments £3.75 billion.  That’s £3.75 billion of tax-payers money that would have been frittered away: on renting buildings that just weren’t necessary; on advertising government projects to the very tax payers that are paying for them.

“But this is just scratching the surface of what we have planned for the coming months and years. We will continue to seek out, and eradicate waste in government, whilst also delivering longer term programmes of reform to ensure sustainable change and room for growth across the public sector.

The savings figures released today have come from efficiency and reform measures implemented across government and have been independently audited. The savings include:

These savings will play an important part in the Government’s objective to tackle the deficit while improving the effectiveness, accountability, transparency and availability of choice in public service delivery.  Francis Maude also stressed today that this is just the beginning of the reform agenda; there is much more yet to deliver. Additionally the Efficiency and Reform Group will be driving through measures:

1.   The Efficiency and Reform Group (ERG) is based in the Cabinet Office, it was set up to ensure that departments across Whitehall adopted a new and ambitious approach to saving money and started working together to ensure the greatest economy of scale when buying goods and services.  It also brings the best in private sector operations practice to government for the first time.

The Group oversees information and communications technology spend, procurement, marketing and consultancy spend, and Civil Service expenses and recruitment.  Much of its work has never been tried by Government before, such as renegotiating contracts with major suppliers across government to reduce costs, and a freeze on all new advertising and marketing spend.

2.   The work of ERG is overseen by an Efficiency Board, chaired jointly by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, and the Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General, Francis Maude.3.   ERG will ensure Departments work together to tackle waste and improve accountability across a range of areas, including information and communications technology (ICT), procurement, projects, HR and property.  Its first priority is to support Departments in the delivery of £6.2 billion savings in 2010/11."

Ian has played an important role in establishing the Efficiency and Reform Group within the Cabinet Office. This group put in place tough cross-Whitehall controls on property, procurement and ICT in 2010.  As a result we have helped departments deliver billions of pounds in cash savings for the taxpayer.  He has assembled an enormously impressive team in ERG who will carry forward this crucial agenda.

I want to thank Ian for his hard work, support and dedication in helping deliver this vital agenda, and wish him well for the future.

Sir Bob Kerslake, Head of the Civil Service, said:

Ian has established the efficiency and reform agenda firmly across government.  Under his leadership, we have made great strides in transparency, procurement and eradicating waste in public spending - putting the government on track to deliver £9 billion in cash savings to date and double the amount of business going to SMEs, setting up the Government Digital Service and launching the first government mutual joint venture. Ian has also led creation of the Major Projects Authority (MPA) that oversees projects worth in excess of £400 billion and the new Major Projects Leadership Academy to build the skills of senior project leaders across government. I have greatly valued his support to me as Head of the Civil Service in leading such an ambitious efficiency and reform programme and wish him and his family all the very best for the future.

Sir Jeremy Heywood, Cabinet Secretary, said:

I have greatly valued the enormous contribution Ian has made to the Civil Service since joining in 2004. Over the last two years in particular we have worked closely together as he has established the Cabinet Office as a genuine centre of excellence in driving efficiency and reform across government. On a personal level too Ian has given me unfailing support and superb advice.

Ian Watmore said:

I have greatly enjoyed my time in the Civil Service, which is one of Britain’s best assets. I admire the wonderful people who work in it, and will miss them greatly. It has been a privilege to have served as a Permanent Secretary in three roles, for three Prime Ministers, and feel lucky to have been able to do this after a long business career.

The standards of supervision and support social workers should expect from their employers include:

The board is also setting out for the first time a single, national set of professional standards outlining what social workers are expected to do at every point in their career and what level of service the public can expect from them. This brings the profession in line with other public sector professionals like doctors, nurses and teachers.

Social work education should also be reformed to improve the quality of social work degrees, with more rigorous selection criteria. The Board recommends that the design of social work courses should involve people who have experienced social services, so that the training properly reflects the real-life reality of the job.

Moira Gibb, CBE, Chair of the Social Work Reform Board and Chief Executive of the London Borough of Camden, said:

A year ago the Social Work Task Force recommended comprehensive reform of the social work system so that in the future, social workers are more consistently able to practise confidently and safely. Since then, the Social Work Reform Board has been working to make the task force’s recommendations a reality.

This report, the first from the Social Work Reform Board, marks a staging post in the journey of social work reform and a foundation for helping us, together, to deliver a better future for social work. The proposals published today should help every individual social worker, every employer of social workers and everyone who educates or trains social workers to do their work better in the interests of those who need and use social work.

The government supports the work of the Social Work Reform Board and is urging the sector to become involved in the next steps towards implementing these important and necessary changes.

Tim Loughton, Children’s Minister, said:

I welcome the Social Work Reform Board’s proposals, which are an important step for social workers to gain the status and respect they so rightly deserve. We are committed to making a real difference to frontline social work and to implementing the Social Work Reform Board’s recommendations. That is why in the new year we will be announcing significant funding to implement the reforms and Professor Munro’s recommendations to improve child protection.

Social workers perform an invaluable job that all too often gets overlooked and taken for granted. They need all the professional support and advice possible so that they feel confident they are making the right decisions.

I thank Moira Gibb and the Reform Board for all the work they have done over the last year. This strongly supports the changes that Professor Munro is advising and will ensure social workers can progress in their careers and feel proud of the vital job they do every day.

Paul Burstow, Care Services Minister, said:

The Social Work Task Force brought forward a number of ideas to improve the social work profession, and this Government has made clear that reform of social work is a priority.

The work of the sector-led Social Work Reform Board, and development of the College of Social Work, will ensure that the task force’s recommendations to improve the profession will become a reality.

David Willetts, Minister for Universities and Science, said:

I welcome the first anniversary report of the Social Work Reform Board’s progress in implementing the recommendations of the Social Work Task Force. This is an important step towards achieving the necessary fundamental and long-term reform of the social work system.  I encourage the social work profession to respond positively to the proposals set out in the report.

The reforms will affect the profession, service users and carers as well as organisations that educate and employ social workers. The Social Work Reform Board is seeking views on its proposals until 31 March 2011.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cash-boost-for-disadvantaged-school-children,Press release,Cash boost for disadvantaged school children,Detail of a 50% rise in the pupil premium.,Department for Education and The Rt Hon David Laws,24 September 2012,"England’s most disadvantaged pupils are to benefit from extra cash next year when the Pupil Premium rises to £900 per pupil - around 50% higher than last year.

Schools receive extra cash through the premium for every child registered as eligible for free school meals (FSM) at any point in the past six years and children in care who have been looked after for six months.

Schools Minister David Laws said:

It’s unacceptable that children from disadvantaged backgrounds are less likely to do well in school than their peers. The coalition government has introduced the pupil premium to tackle this problem.

After just one year, many schools are already telling us that the Pupil Premium is making a difference.

This extra funding will help schools provide the extra support children and young people need to reach their full potential.

Statistics show that, in 2011, the latest available:

Evidence shows that children from low income families generally do not achieve as well as other pupils. Schools therefore receive additional pupil premium funding on top of the school budget to enable them to support these pupils in reaching their potential and to help schools reduce educational inequality.

Just 13.2 % of children looked after by local authorities achieve 5 good GCSE grades, including English and maths, and the government wants them to benefit from the extra funding through the premium.

Whilst schools have the freedom to use the pupil premium funding in innovative ways, it is vital they use it to boost results for the most disadvantaged pupils. They will be held to account by Ofsted through its inspections which include a closer focus on premium use and the performance of pupils who attract it, as well as a focus on the achievement of disadvantaged pupils in the school performance tables. Schools are also required to publish online details of their premium spend for parents.

Following the popularity of the summer schools for Pupil Premium pupils, the Government will be making £50 million available for the scheme to run again next year.

Nearly 2000 schools received government funding to run a summer school this year, providing up to two weeks of support for around 65,000 disadvantaged children. Schools offered a range of activities aimed at helping children settle in to the new school, ranging from catch-up lessons for those children needing extra help, to extra-curricular activities such as theatre trips, and Olympics-related sporting events.

Pupils can struggle to make the jump to secondary education. Moving to a larger school and having to tackle a more challenging curriculum can be daunting for some pupils. This results in a dip in their performance, which can persist throughout their time at school.

ENDS

The Department for Education has also confirmed that the per pupil level of the pupil premium for the financial year 2012 to 2013 will rise from £600 to £619. This follows a smaller-than-expected rise in the number of pupils registering for free school meals in January 2012. The allocations to schools will be revised to reflect this change in the per pupil amount.

Details of how secondary schools can sign up to run summer schools in 2013 will be announced shortly. Further information on thePupil premium summer schoolscan be found online.

The Department for Education will be announcing further details on the Service Children’s Premium for the 2013 to 2014 financial year shortly.

In fact, between 2000 and 2010 the UK pharmaceuticals industry (a major part of life sciences) grew faster than any sector of the economy except the finance and insurance sector.

Globally the industry is changing with more focus on collaboration, out-sourcing of research and earlier clinical trials with patients.

Prime Minister David Cameron said:

“We can be proud of our past - but we cannot be complacent about our future. The industry is changing; not just year by year, but month by month. We must ensure that the UK stays ahead, yes, we’ve got a leading science base, we’ve got four of the world’s top ten universities, and, we have a National Health Service unlike any other.

“But these strengths alone are not enough to keep pace with what’s happening - we’ve got to change radically - the way we innovate, the way we collaborate, the way we open up the NHS.

“The two reports we’re publishing today are testament to our ambition: not just to hang on in there with a significant foot-hold in the global market, but to take an even bigger share of that market in the years to come. I want the great discoveries of the next decade happening in British labs, the new technologies born in British start-ups.”

The Government has launched itsLife Sciences Strategy (PDF, 1.0 Mb)and a review of innovation in the NHS to meet this challenge and attract further investment to the UK. The measures bring our science base and the NHS together to ensure the UK is the best place in the world for companies to invest in the discovery, development and commercialisation of medical innovations.

It includes a new £180 million catalyst fund to help the next generation of brilliant British medical breakthroughs become the next generation of great British companies. This fund will target the funding gap that exists - the so called ‘valley of death’ - between the moment that a bright new idea is developed in the laboratory and the point when a new drug or technology can be invested in by the market.

Minister for Universities and Science David Willetts said:

“Our life sciences industry is a vital driver of growth and employs tens of thousands of people. But it is rapidly changing. We need to keep ahead of the game and make the UK one of the best places for companies to invest in innovation.

“To do this we need to create the right environment for scientists and business to work together and translate research into new, cutting-edge technologies and medicines. This will this boost our economy, create new jobs, and lead to better treatments for patients.”"

A consultation published today sets out a new approach to tackling poverty, building on Frank Field’s Independent review on poverty and life chances and Graham Allen’s work on early intervention.

The government is clear that tackling child poverty requires more than simply treating the short-term symptoms of poverty or moving families across an arbitrary income line. Making real progress requires a new focus on promoting fairness, opportunity and social mobility - to help address ingrained patterns of worklessness, family breakdown and educational under-achievement.

Launching the new strategy consultation, Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said:

For too long a child’s birth has dictated their fate. It’s a scandal that in today’s society we still have 2.8 million children living in poverty in the UK - let down by a lack of opportunity and aspiration.

The best way to eradicate child poverty is to address the causes of poverty, rather than only treat the symptoms. Frank Field’s independent report on poverty and life chances, published earlier this month, is a welcome reminder of how important early years childcare and education is to setting a child on the road to success and out of poverty.

That’s why we are reforming Sure Start services to target the most needy and are extending the offer of 15-hours of free childcare a week to all disadvantaged 2-year-olds. And through the pupil premium schools will be able to support the poorest at every stage of their education.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tackling-child-sexual-exploitation-must-be-a-priority-says-minister,News story,"Tackling child sexual exploitation must be a priority, says minister",The Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation Action Plan brings together actions by the government and partners to protect children from abuse.,Department for Education and Tim Loughton,27 January 2012,"A new action plan published today calls on all local areas to take urgent action to stop the sexual exploitation of children and young people.

Child sexual exploitation - a victim’s story

Children’s Minister Tim Loughton warned of failure by local agencies to recognise and deal with the problem of child sexual exploitation in many areas of the country.

He said tackling child sexual exploitation must be a priority and Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs) must now act to establish the severity of the problem in their areas, make sure they are tackling it effectively, and put in place robust preventative strategies.

The Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation Action Plan brings together for the first time actions by the government and partners to protect children from this largely hidden crime. These include:

Sexual exploitation of children under 18 can involve gangs or individuals giving gifts like money, food, drugs or alcohol in exchange for the victim performing sexual activities. Or it can happen through grooming using technology, for example being persuaded to post sexual images on the internet or phone. The young people are often lured into this and trapped through very heavy intimidation and controlling tactics.

Tim Loughton said:

This country has to wake up to the fact that children are being sexually abused in far greater numbers than was ever imagined. It could be going on in every type of community and in every part of the country.

Too many local areas have failed to uncover the true extent of child sexual exploitation in their communities and failed to properly support victims and their families.

Child sexual exploitation is child abuse, it is not good enough that some local areas don’t recognise it as an issue. This is an extremely serious crime and must be treated as such, with the perpetrators pursued more vigorously. We need to make going to court much easier for the young victims and their families. It is worrying that many incidents go unreported because victims are unwilling to come forward.

We can only succeed if we address every aspect of the problem. The action plan is a big step forward and looks at sexual exploitation from the perspective of the young person, analysing what can go wrong and what should happen at every stage.

The plan outlines a compelling case for local areas to act quickly and for parents, and frontline professionals who come into contact with potential victims and perpetrators, to intervene at the earliest possible opportunity to stop the crime escalating.

Victims of child sexual exploitation often suffer long-term physical and psychological damage that can affect all the family and needs long-term care. Research by Barnardo’s shows that there is an estimated potential saving of £12 for every £1 spent on providing the intervention.

To raise awareness among frontline professionals who work in child protection, the Department for Education will:

The Government plan also emphasises the need for the criminal justice system to come down hard on perpetrators and make sure victims and their families get the right support. The action plan brings together commitments from the Home Office, Ministry of Justice and the Crown Prosecution Service, including:

Hilary Willmer, Chair of the Coalition for the Removal of Pimping (CROP), welcomed the action plan and said:

CROP particularly welcomes the recognition that whole families suffer the devastating consequences of child sexual exploitation and need support. CROP hopes that there will also be recognition of the significant positive potential of many parents to be included as active partners in the safeguarding of children.

Sheila Taylor, director of the National Working Group for Sexually Exploited Children and Young People, said:

I welcome this urgent call to action by the Government. There are pockets of good, innovative practice but most local authorities have no one to co-ordinate such work and no one to look at the bigger picture. This must change, if no one is putting the pieces together, children’s desperate situations will continue to be missed.

The report rightly addresses the need for local agencies and voluntary organisations to work together to tackle child sexual exploitation; for more training to raise awareness among professionals; and for the courts to recognise the impact of the legal process on victims.

The action plan is available on theDepartment for Education’s website. It identifies four key stages where better interventions are needed:
* Raising awareness of this issue with young people, parents and professionals and preventing it taking place.
* Taking effective inter-agency action against exploitation and helping children who are victims to get out of it.
* Securing prosecutions and improving court processes, to reinforce the fact that child sexual exploitation is not just a particularly vicious form of child aover a long period of time.

The Government will review progress on the action plan in Spring 2012.

It is the role of LSCBs to bring together children’s social care, health, education, police and other bodies to co-operate to tackle local child protection issues. Recent research shows that only a quarter of LSCBs are implementing statutory guidance on tackling child sexual exploitation.

The action plan follows the publication of thePuppet on a Stringreport by Barnardo’s.

Key changes to the Key Stage 2 system will make it fairer for all and more effective in raising standards.

Michael Gove said the substantial reforms would ensure that heads, teachers, pupils and parents would be able to have confidence in the new system.

Currently there is statutory teacher assessment in every core subject - maths, reading, writing, speaking and listening, and science. There are also external tests in maths, writing and reading, and a sample test in science.

The changes include:

Maths and reading tests will continue to be externally tested but will be refined over time. Teacher assessment of science, with a sample test monitoring national standards, will continue. Speaking and listening will continue to be teacher assessed.

Education Secretary Michael Gove thanked the panel for their report. He said:

These changes represent an educationally sound approach and substantial reform. The system in future will be fairer for teachers and pupils. It will give parents the vital information they need and will hold schools accountable.

I have always been clear that external accountability is essential if we are to drive up standards, and Lord Bew’s report recognises this. Publishing a greater range of data will be fairer for schools - schools should not be judged on one measure alone.

There has been criticism that the current writing test encourages drilling. It is clear that elements of writing where there are right and wrong answers - spelling, punctuation and grammar - lend themselves to external testing. But writing composition is better suited to teacher assessment. We will trust teachers to judge their pupils’ abilities.

The changes will be introduced as quickly as possible, most from 2012. In 2012 interim arrangements for writing assessment will be required. Those arrangements should be in line with the principles in Lord Bew’s report and ensure that results are as reliable and robust as possible. We believe some external testing will be required alongside teacher assessment. We will discuss the detailed arrangements for 2012 with the profession and confirm them to schools at the start of the new school year.

This will allow for the new spelling, punctuation, grammar and vocabulary test to be designed and properly piloted, and ensure the moderation of teacher assessment is robust, ready for full implementation from 2013.

The review was chaired by the cross-bench peer Lord Bew and consisted of headteachers and education experts. Michael Gove set up the review last year. He said external accountability at Key Stage 2 was vital because it was shown to drive up standards but agreed the current system was flawed and could be improved.

Lord Bew said today:

I am pleased that all our recommendations have been accepted. This is a complex area and many conflicting views were presented to us. But this package will lead to a better system, one that will do the jobs everyone wants it to do and which will have the confidence of all parties involved.

The review will look at how children can experience a wide variety of high quality cultural experiences, both inside and outside of school.

Darren Henley is today issuing an open invitation to anyone who wants to contribute to the consultation and feed into his review. He will aim to create a definition of what a solid cultural education should comprise of and how to make sure that all young people benefit from it.

Culture Minister Ed Vaizey said:

Learning about culture and having opportunities to take part offers huge rewards to young people. Our culture brings audiences from across the world and we are particularly adept at producing world-leading performers and artists. To remain in such a strong position we need to be sure that we are giving children the best start in their cultural education. This should not just be an optional extra, but an essential part of every child’s school life.

Darren Henley did a fantastic job with his review of music education and is perfectly positioned to lead this review.

Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove, said:

Every child should be exposed to rich cultural opportunities. Too often, this is a privilege reserved for the wealthy few. This must change.

In order for our young people to succeed in higher education and employment we must provide them with a rigorous, well-rounded education. The best schools are already doing this.

This important review will play a key role in ensuring that children from all backgrounds can reap the benefits of our culture and heritage.

It has also announced its intention to include iGCSE results in school performance tables as soon as possible.

The announcement means that state-funded schools will be free to teach from September a wide range of these respected and valued qualifications, putting them on a level playing field with independent schools who have offered them for some time.

Schools Minister Nick Gibb has also announced that development of the new diplomas in science, humanities and languages, due to be introduced from September 2011, will cease immediately. This means instant savings of around £1.77 million, plus further savings in future years.

Along with today’s significant qualifications announcements, ministers also confirmed that they will not proceed with the last government’s proposed new primary curriculum, which was based on a review led by Sir Jim Rose. The new curriculum was due to be taught in schools from September 2011.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-powers-for-schools-to-beat-the-takeaways,News story,New powers for schools to beat the takeaways,Schools will now be able to take on the takeaways with special meal deals to boost uptake of school lunches and tackle obesity.,Department for Education and Sarah Teather,29 December 2011,"Under new powers, schools will be able to offer price promotions on meals to particular pupils, encouraging more children to try a healthy school lunch.

Takeaways frequently target school pupils by tempting them with cheap lunchtime deals. Previously schools were unable to do so and had to charge the same price for the same item for every pupil, unless they applied for special permission from the Government.

The new, voluntary rules will mean schools can target pupils not eating school lunches or where uptake traditionally drops off, such at the start of secondary school. For example, schools may choose to offer:

Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said:

School meals beat takeaways hands down on the quality of food they serve, but up until now they have struggled to compete on price. Getting children into the school canteen is vital - the benefits of healthy school meals are clear. These new powers are an important step in tackling childhood obesity, and will mean schools can help hard-pressed families.

No longer will schools be tied by complicated red tape, instead they will be able to use their initiative to increase take up of school meals. Already we’ve seen some great examples of pioneering schools keen to offer special deals - now others across the country will be able to follow suit.

Judy Hargadon, Chief Executive of the Children’s Food Trust and the School Food Trust said:

When children eat better, they do better - which is why we want to see more children able to have a healthy school meal every day, and why it’s in the interests of schools to do everything they can to boost take up. Keeping meals affordable is a crucial part of this, and many parents have told us that they’d be more likely to try school meals for their child if they were on offer at a discount.

Price promotions do increase take up in the long-term so while a school wanting to run a really big promotion will have to invest to cover the cost, it will pay back a big return. Even on a much smaller scale, we know that many schools are keen to help families who don’t qualify for free school meals but might be struggling to find money for lunches every day. We’re particularly keen to test out how these powers can help larger families with the costs of school meals and will also be producing a guide to using the new legislation for all schools next year.

The latest annual school food survey showed that, while the uptake of school lunches has increased across the board, there is a drop off of 6.5 percentage points between primary and secondary school.

Research earlier this year by the School Food Trust showed that almost 6 out of 10 parents were keen to switch to school meals if they were offered price promotions.

The changes are part of the Education Act 2011, and will come into force next year. The Act safeguards pupils not included in a special offer by preventing the school from charging more than the cost of providing the meal. Use of flexible charging is entirely optional and will involve a local decision to subsidise meals during the offer period.

Previously, a school or local authority had to apply to the Secretary of State for a ‘Power to Innovate’ [under section 2 of the Education Act 2002] suspending the statutory requirement to charge every pupil the same price for the same quantity of the same item. Case studies:
* During a free school meal offer in Bolton made under the Power to Innovate, the take-up levels increased to record levels of 86% for the targeted year group, 37.5% higher than the average take-up in all year groups in Bolton primary schools.  Their subsequent £1 meal deal produced a 69.9% take up, which was 21.4% higher than the norm.  Bolton’s initiatives also produced a significant increase in statutory free meal take up.
* North Yorkshire County Council operated a two-tier meal charge in primary schools for a limited period, with a lower charge (£1.80 instead of £2.00) for siblings where more than one child from a family was regularly taking a meal at school.  This was a popular innovation with around 16% of all paid meals attracting a discount, thus helping to increase take up and thereby the financial viability of the service. 
* Gateshead offered five days of free lunch for all reception pupils starting classes in September 2008.
* As part of its main catering contract Ealing provide free school meals to all of its reception children for a week.
* Brent ran a free meals pilot in 3 schools in 2006/07 and expanded this to 6 schools in 2007/08.  In each school a year group in Key Stage 1 was offered a free school meal for a week.  It was left to the schools to decide which year to target. This resulted in an increased uptake of school meals of 6% between February 07 and February 08.

Thelatest annual survey of school food(2010-11) showed that take up of school lunches was 44.1% in primary schools and 37.6% in secondary schools. This represented an increase over 2009-2010 of 2.7 percentage points in the primary sector and 1.8 percentage points in the secondary sector. This equates to about 173,000 more pupils taking school lunch in 2010-2011.

Research from the School Food Trustin September 2011, showed that 58% of parents in the survey whose children didn’t already have a school lunch said they would be willing to sign up to try school meals in September 2011, if meals were offered at a reduced price.

The Education Act 2011 (section 35) is available on theParliament website.

The newcyber security guidance for businesslooks at how to safeguard a company’s most valuable assets, such as personal data, online services and intellectual property.

It is designed to reinforce the idea that this is a strategic risk that needs to be managed at board level.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said:

Cyber security threats pose a real and significant risk to UK business by targeting valuable assets such as data and intellectual property. By properly protecting themselves against attacks companies are protecting their bottom line.

Ensuring this happens should be the responsibility of any chief executive or chair as part of an approach to good corporate governance which secures a business for the long-term.

The guidance, produced byCESG(the Information Security arm of GCHQ), the Department for Business and theCentre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI), will help the private sector minimise the risks to company assets.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-academies-than-ever-rated-as-outstanding,News story,More academies than ever rated as outstanding,The Ofsted annual report shows a record number of academies rated 'outstanding' while 'inadequate' ratings across the schools sector doubled.,Department for Education and The Rt Hon Michael Gove,23 November 2010,"The 2010 Ofsted annual report published today shows that while generally across the schools sector the number of inspections this year resulting in an inadequate rating has doubled, academies have bucked the trend using their freedoms to raise standards across the board with more than ever being rated as outstanding.

Commenting on the report, Education Secretary Michael Gove, said:

This report shows us the real picture of our schools revealed by the new, more rigorous inspection regime. A worrying 576 schools, up from 360 last year, are either in special measures or have been given a notice to improve, with the number rated as inadequate in the last year twice as high as the year before. Even taking into account the new inspection system, this is simply unacceptable. No parent wants to send their child to a failing school and they shouldn’t have to.

There are also concerns in safeguarding, children’s homes and fostering. Whilst the vast majority of professionals in this area do an incredible job in very difficult circumstances delivering high-quality care, there are some areas that can be improved. The Munro review will look at child protection to help professionals get the support they need so that they are able to spend more time with children and families and less time on paperwork.

The report shows that solid leadership, high-quality teaching, freedoms over the curriculum and strong governance all add up to high standards and rapid improvements. Academy schools which have these freedoms have bucked the national trend and have seen an increase in the numbers getting the top Ofsted rating despite the new tougher inspections. That’s why our White Paper this week will outline further plans to make these freedoms a reality in as many schools as possible.

There has been a marked improvement in children’s services inspected and the best foster homes, children’s centres and social workers are turning around the life chances of some of society’s most disadvantaged and vulnerable people. There is a lot we can learn from and I’m determined that we will free up both the education and the children’s sectors so that professionals can learn from the best, adapting delivery to their local needs rather than having to follow a set system dictated from Whitehall.

Key points on academies in the report include:

Commenting on the quality of teaching, Michael Gove said:

The biggest factor in raising standards in schools is the quality of its teachers. The best education systems in the world consistently draw their teachers from the top tier of graduates by academic ability and select them carefully to ensure they are taking only those people who combine the right personal and intellectual qualities.

There is consensus amongst the highest performing countries that the most important thing we can do for teachers is train them well and then throughout their professional career. Too much teacher training involves either teachers being told how to comply with government criteria, or what John Bangs called quite rightly ‘death by PowerPoint’.

Teachers need to learn from other teachers. I have been impressed by arguments that the way to ensure we have good continual professional development is by getting teachers to observe superb practitioners of the craft and to learn from them. Today’s Ofsted report is a ringing endorsement of this, highlighting how schools with outstanding teaching frequently have senior school staff monitoring lessons which allows others to learn from the best teachers. That’s why our White Paper tomorrow will outline plans to give schools more flexibility to do this by removing restrictions on the time heads and other senior staff are allowed to monitor lessons.

But this has to start right from the outset with initial teacher training, and the Ofsted report is also clear that teachers need more practical classroom training to back up their theoretical training. Our White Paper will also outline plans to ensure trainee teachers spend more time in hands-on learning in the classroom.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/education-bill-gives-secretary-of-state-new-powers-to-intervene-in-underperforming-schools,Press release,Education Bill gives Secretary of State new powers to intervene in underperforming schools,"Measures proposed to root out bad behaviour, tackle underperformance and improve accountability of schools.",Department for Education and The Rt Hon Michael Gove,27 January 2011,"The Education Bill, published today, will help teachers raise standards in schools. It includes measures to root out bad behaviour, tackle underperformance and improve the way in which schools are held to account.

Measures in the Bill include:

Education Secretary Michael Gove said today:

We’re lucky that there are many teachers doing a fantastic job. But there are still too many schools that simply aren’t good enough. We must learn from other countries which do things better.

We’re giving more powers for teachers to do their job properly - the ability to impose better discipline - and freeing them from bureaucracy. The best schools will be freed from inspections so Ofsted will now concentrate on what matters - teaching and behaviour.

But we also need tough new powers to take action when things go wrong. In the worst schools there will be new intervention powers. Ofsted will focus on the worst-performing schools where they are needed most.  It is unacceptable that children should suffer in schools that are not doing a good job.

Subject to the passage of the Bill, the Secretary of State will now be able to direct a local authority to close schools that are judged to be in special measures, require significant improvement, or have failed to comply with a warning notice. He will also be able to direct local authorities to give a warning notice to an underperforming school.

These new powers will mean the government can intervene whenever a school is not providing the kind of education children deserve.

The best school systems in the world are characterised by strong accountability, so in addition to recent changes to performance tables, the government is also reforming the school inspection system.

Under the current Ofsted framework inspectors make at least 27 separate judgements. We are focusing inspection on 4 key areas:

We want inspectors to spend more of their time concentrating on teaching to drive improvement in educational standards. The Bill will also exempt ‘outstanding’ schools from routine inspection so they can be free to continue doing what they do so well.  Ofsted will be able to focus their resources on the underperforming schools.

Responding to these changes, Kate Dethridge, Head of Churchend Primary School, said:

It is good news that there will be a reduction in the criteria against which we are inspected. At the end of the day, the most important thing is to be judged on the core purpose of raising standards. Schools should be trusted to achieve the right outcomes for their pupils, without having to be judged on the process to achieve those outcomes.

It is also welcome that outstanding schools will be exempt from inspections. Constantly self-reviewing and improving the school, and maintaining standards, is a head’s core purpose. Going through the process of an Ofsted inspection is time-consuming and does not add any value in an outstanding school.

Greg Martin, Executive Head of Durand Academy, said:

In recent years monitoring mechanisms have become increasingly complex and we welcome the move today to streamline Ofsted inspections to focus on the things that matter most to parents - quality teaching, effective leadership, good behaviour and safety for every child.

These are also the components of all great schools and Ofsted inspectors will now be able to work closely with improving schools to get these fundamentals right.

International league tables show we are not performing at the same level as many countries across the world. The government believes we must learn from the best education systems. That’s why the Bill puts a duty on Ofqual, the independent watchdog for qualifications, to compare our exam standards against the highest performing systems. It will ensure that England does not continue to fall behind other countries.

The Bill also gives teachers the power to tackle bad behaviour and maintain good discipline. The Bill will:

Responding to the Bill, James McAtear, Head of Hartismere Secondary School, said:

These reforms will help to redress the balance in favour of good discipline in schools. They send out a strong message that our society is not willing to tolerate poor behaviour and that we will provide a safe and supportive environment in which every child can learn.

The government is also stripping away the overbearing and unnecessary red tape that takes up teacher time that would be better spent in the classroom or preparing lessons. The Bill includes measures to

Local authority powers to direct a college to invoke disciplinary procedures and appoint members to governing bodies will be removed.

Responding to the measures on bureaucracy, Sue Barratt, Head of Bournville Junior School, said:

Headteachers currently spend 15 or more hours a week on unnecessary paperwork. This time could be better spent doing more important things as a headteacher - doing what we’re there for, raising standards of teaching and learning in the school, and supporting our staff and pupils in the classroom and around the school. We really appreciate that the government is listening to the profession and realises that unnecessary bureaucracy is hindering schools from carrying out their core purpose of raising standards in education for all children.

Larry Montagu, Head of St. Peter’s Catholic School in Gloucester, said:

Any legislation that reduces bureaucracy and allows teachers to concentrate on their core purpose of helping children learn has got to be applauded.

Dr Reena Keeble, Head of Canon Lane First School, said:

I am pleased this Bill will cut bureaucracy - taking away paperwork gives us greater freedom to address children’s needs, which is what we are here for. Spending time doing admin or getting stats together for inspections and data collections takes you away from focusing on your core purpose of ensuring children are able to get an outstanding education.

Penny Barratt, Head of the Bridge School (a special school), said:

Schools will really welcome the removal and clarification of some statutory and non-statutory requirements. This will support the reduction of bureaucracy, which schools have to deal with on a day-to-day basis.

The Education Bill had its first reading on Wednesday 26 January 2011 and is published today.

A copy of the Bill is available on theHouse of Commonswebsite.

Other measures in the bill: 
* As part of the Government’s ‘fairness premium’, the Bill also introduces a new entitlement to free early years provision for disadvantaged 2-year-olds, while maintaining a universal free entitlement for children aged 3 and 4
 * It repeals the duty on LAs to ensure every young person has access to 14 to 19 diplomas. We want schools and colleges to have the freedom to offer the qualifications that best serve their students. We will also give local authorities the freedom to target their support to those vulnerable and disadvantaged young people who they identify need it most
 * It simplifies the current bureaucratic competition process required to open a new school, and gives preference to the opening of new free schools. The legislation relating to academies will be extended to enable 16 to 19 academies and academies providing alternative provision to be established so the benefits of free schools and academies can be extended to more pupils
 * It ensures complaints about admissions arrangements at all schools, including academies, will go to the schools adjudicator so they are all dealt with consistently
 * It simplifies the complex intervention arrangements in underperforming sixth-form colleges, removing the dual roles of local authorities and the Young People’s Learning Agency. These changes will ensure resources are spent where they are most needed - on the front line. With less central prescription and interference, many functions of these arm’s length bodies will fall away and ministers will be able to take responsibility and be held accountable for the continuing functions.

The Bill will also take forward aspects of the changes to higher education student finance: change to interest rates on student loans and the regulation of fees for part-time students. All enquiries on these aspects should be taken to the Department for Business Innovation and Skills.

Eight people from the worlds of academia, politics, business, child welfare and social mobility have been appointed to support the work of chairman Alan Milburn.

The appointees are:

These members will join the commission’s board. Their appointment means the commission is now fully operational and can begin its work to ensure that the government makes real progress in freeing children from the burden of poverty and ensuring everyone has the opportunity to fulfil their potential.

Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, said:

I welcome the appointment of these members of the commission. Everyone should have the same opportunities, whatever their circumstances or the background they are born into, and the commission has an important role to play in achieving that outcome.

Iain Duncan Smith, Work and Pensions Secretary, said:

This government is committed to eradicating child poverty and the commission has an important role to play in this work. I welcome the appointment of these new members today.
I look forward to working closely with the commission as we develop a better measurement of child poverty, so we can tackle the root causes of poverty and bring real change to children’s lives.

David Laws, Minister of State for Schools, said:

We want to give children and families as much support as we can. The pupil premium and the expansion of early education are giving poorer children a better start in life. I am pleased that so many distinguished people are playing a role in the commission’s work to help us improve social mobility and reduce child poverty.

Alan Milburn, Chair of The Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, said:

I am delighted to welcome the new members of the commission. The skills and experience they bring will be vital in helping the government realise the ambition of moving children out of poverty and giving everyone the opportunity to succeed.

The Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission is an advisory non-departmental public body established under the Welfare Reform Act 2012. It monitors the government’s progress in improving social mobility and reducing child poverty in the United Kingdom. It will also monitor the implementation of the most recent UK, Scottish, and Welsh child poverty strategies, and challenge non-government institutions such as those in higher education, business and elsewhere to improve their performance on social mobility.

The UK Government appointed Alan Milburn as the Chair of the Commission on 16 July 2012. Appointments to the UK Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission are regulated by the Commissioner for Public Appointments and made in accordance with the commissioner’s code of practice for ministerial appointments to public bodies.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/complete-ban-on-evictions-and-additional-protection-for-renters,Press release,Complete ban on evictions and additional protection for renters,Government announces radical package of measures to protect renters and landlords affected by coronavirus.,"Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (2018 to 2021) and The Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP",18 March 2020,"The government has announced a radical package of measures to protect renters and landlords affected by coronavirus. As a result, no renter in either social or private accommodation will be forced out of their home during this difficult time.

Emergency legislation will be taken forward as an urgent priority so that landlords will not be able to start proceedings to evict tenants for at least a 3 month period. As a result of these measures, no renters in private or social accommodation needs to be concerned about the threat of eviction.

Recognising the additional pressures the virus may put on landlords, we have confirmed that the 3 month mortgage payment holiday announced yesterday will be extended to landlords whose tenants are experiencing financial difficulties due to coronavirus. This will alleviate the pressure on landlords, who will be concerned about meeting mortgage payments themselves, and will mean no unnecessary pressure is put on their tenants as a result.

At the end of this period, landlords and tenants will be expected to work together to establish an affordable repayment plan, taking into account tenants’ individual circumstances.

To support this announcement the government has worked with the Master of the Rolls to widen the ‘pre-action protocol’ on possession proceedings, to include private renters and to strengthen its remit. This will support the necessary engagement between landlords and tenants to resolve disputes and landlords will have to reach out to tenants to understand the financial position they are in.

The government will also issue guidance which asks landlords to show compassion and to allow tenants who are affected by this to remain in their homes wherever possible. The National Housing Federation and Local Government Association have welcomed the new support for social renters and made clear that no one should be evicted because of the coronavirus.

This important step on buy to let mortgages ensures parity of support, further to the announcement yesterday that the government made for private mortgage holders.

We are also announcing that those who have benefited from a government backed Help to Buy equity loan will be offered interest payment holidays if they are struggling to pay due to coronavirus.

Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick MP said:

The government is clear – no renter who has lost income due to coronavirus will be forced out of their home, nor will any landlord face unmanageable debts.

These are extraordinary times and renters and landlords alike are of course worried about paying their rent and mortgage. Which is why we are urgently introducing emergency legislation to protect tenants in social and private accommodation from an eviction process being started.

These changes will protect all renters and private landlords ensuring everyone gets the support they need at this very difficult time.

Ben Beadle, Chief Executive of the National Residential Landlords association said:

Landlord groups welcomes government support. We recognise the exceptional circumstances and we will work collaboratively with government to ensure these measures protect both landlords and tenants

Any changes to legislation will only apply to England and Wales, as we share a legal system. We will, of course, be working with the Devolved Administrations across our coronavirus response.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ofqual-launches-consultation-on-gcse-reform,Press release,Ofqual launches consultation on GCSE reform,"Ofqual has today (Tuesday, 11th June) launched a 12 week consultation on GCSE reform.",Ofqual,11 June 2013,"The Secretary of State wrote to Ofqual earlier this year to set out his policy and curriculum objectives for reformed GCSEs in England.  We considered the letter carefully and agreed to set in hand a reform programme, which will also be an opportunity to address some concerns we have about current GCSEs.  This initial consultation therefore sets out our proposed regulatory arrangements for reformed qualifications, which are in line with the policy objectives.

Chief Regulator Glenys Stacey said:

Ofqual’s role is to make sure that qualifications are of high quality.  GCSEs are important and valued qualifications, but we have seen over the last two years that they can be improved. We have a real opportunity here to put in place reformed GCSEs which are engaging and worthwhile to study and to teach. Quite legitimately, the Secretary of State has set out his policy and curriculum ambitions for the reformed qualifications, and we have taken account of those.

We want to see qualifications that are more stretching for the most able students, using assessments that really test knowledge, understanding and skills essential to the subject, and that are designed so that outcomes are well regarded.  The consultation seeks views on the defining characteristics of the reformed qualifications.  In developing our proposals, we have looked at a range of evidence including from overseas, and looked at the lessons from past difficulties with reformed qualifications.

We want the reformed qualifications to command the confidence of those who use them.  So we ask the education community and all others with an interest to engage fully with this consultation, and we look forward to receiving their views.

The proposals, which would apply to GCSEs in England, would see:

A parallel consultation on curriculum content for the reformed qualifications is being launched today by the Department for Education, reflecting the proposed new National Curriculum.The DfE’s consultation can be found here.

Ofqual has today also publisheda report on our review into controlled assessment.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/extra-measures-to-support-students-ahead-of-next-summers-exams,Press release,Extra measures to support students ahead of next summer’s exams,Students sitting exams and other assessments next year will benefit from a package of exceptional measures to improve fairness and prevent disruption,Department for Education and The Rt Hon Sir Gavin Williamson CBE MP,3 December 2020,"Students sitting exams and other assessments next year will benefit from a package of exceptional measures to make them as fair as possible and manage the disruption caused by Covid-19, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson announced today (Thursday 3 December).

In recognition of the challenges faced by students this year, grades will be more generous, students will be given advance notice of some topic areas, and steps will be taken to ensure every student receives a grade, even if they miss a paper due to self-isolation or illness.

The Government has been clear that exams are the fairest way to judge a student’s performance and has made keeping schools and colleges open a national priority throughout the pandemic in order to minimise disruption to education.

Building on the three-week delay to exams to free up extra teaching time announced in October, the new measures include:

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said:

Exams are the best way of giving young people the opportunity to show what they can do which is why it’s so important they take place next summer.

But this isn’t business as usual. I know students are facing unprecedented disruption to their learning. That’s why exams will be different next year, taking exceptional steps to ensure they are as fair as possible.

I am determined to support students, parents and teachers in these unprecedented times and hope measures like more generous grading and advance notice of some topic areas will give young people the clarity and confidence they need to achieve every success.

Today’s steps follow extensive engagement with Ofqual, exam boards and senior leaders across the education sector.

The measures recognise that while teachers have gone above and beyond to support their pupils during a difficult period, some young people have had their teaching disrupted more than others and will need extra support to catch up on the curriculum and achieve their potential in exams.

In these instances, receiving advance notice of some topic areas and being given exam aids will support students and ensure they can move on to their next stage of education, training or employment with the grades they deserve.

Students taking vocational and technical qualifications will also see adaptations to ensure parity between general and vocational qualifications. Some vocational qualifications will require more varied adaptations due to the different qualification types.

The Government has also developed a series of contingency measures with Ofqual that will mean, even if students miss one or more exams due to self-isolation or sickness but have still completed a proportion of their qualification they will still receive a grade.

If a student misses all their assessments in a subject, they will have the opportunity to sit a contingency paper held shortly after the main exams. In the extreme case where a student has a legitimate reason to miss all their papers, then a validated teacher informed assessment can be used, only once all chances to sit an exam have passed.

The Government will set out further detail on this process, and on adaptations to exams, in the new year.

The Government has also announced that full, graded Ofsted inspections will not resume until the summer term.

In the interim, Ofsted will conduct supportive monitoring inspections to those schools and colleges currently judged “inadequate” and some that “require improvement”. These inspections will focus on important issues like curriculum, remote education and pupil attendance, particularly of vulnerable children.

Ofsted will also continue to have the power to inspect a school, further education or early years provider, if they have serious concerns, including about safeguarding and remote education.

John Jolly, Chief Executive, Parentkind, said:

We welcome the clarity that the Department is providing for parents of young people preparing to take their exams in summer 2021. Parents have told us that the uncertainty over arrangements for exams has been a source of concern and anxiety for both them and their children.

Parents and young people will be relieved to have a clearer sense of what the arrangements are and how this will ensure that individual circumstances are taken into account. At Parentkind we will continue to raise parents’ questions about the arrangements going forward.

Leora Cruddas, Chief Executive, Confederation of School Trusts, said:

Given the disruption to teaching last year, as well as the likelihood of ongoing disruption this year, it is increasingly likely that large numbers of students will not be able to cover all the content needed for examinations, as they would in a normal year.

These steps help students feel confident about their exams as an important step towards making the system is as fair as possible.

Test and exam results will not be included in performance tables this year, and instead will be replaced by attendance information, and student destinations and the subjects taken at key stage 4 and 5.

These changes take account of the challenges posed by the pandemic but will ensure parents still have access to vital information about their local school.

The Government has also reviewed remote education guidance and published updated expectations to provide further clarity for schools, colleges, parents and pupils. Primary schools are expected to provide a minimum of three hours a day on average of remote education, with secondary schools expected to provide at least four hours’ worth.

Similar expectations will apply for colleges and other further education providers which take into account the sector’s role in delivering both academic and technical provision.

Forprimary assessments,key stage 1 tests in English reading and mathematics, and the English grammar, punctuation and spelling tests at key stage 1 and 2 will be removed for one year, in recognition of the challenges posed by the pandemic.
For primary assessments, key stage 1 tests in English reading and mathematics, and the English grammar, punctuation and spelling tests at key stage 1 and 2 will be removed for one year, in recognition of the challenges posed by the pandemic.

Schools can take aflexible approachto the administration of the key stage 2 tests and phonics screening check, by extending the original timetable by a week, until 26 May and 25 June, respectively.

Although primary performance data will not be published, teacher assessment in English reading, writing and mathematics at key stage 1, and all other assessments at key stage 2, will remain. These measures will help to understand pupils’ lost time in education and support those that need it most, providing vital information to parents and assisting with pupils’ transition to secondary schools.

Martyn Oliver, Chief Executive of Outwood Grange Academy Trust, said:

As a Trust which supports 39 schools in the North of England, of which 35 are located within a Tier 3 region since the national restrictions ended, our focus has been and remains on how children who have faced unprecedented disruption will be treated fairly.

By running exams with these measures and committing to looking at the differential loss of learning, our children and their parents can feel assured work to level-up is serious.

Ian Pryce, Chief Executive of Bedford College, said:

The Department and Ofqual have consulted genuinely, widely and seriously and I hope this will reassure students, parents and teachers.

Great care is being taken to ensure students will have an opportunity to sit their exams; will have longer to prepare, and will be given information and options to help them achieve even where they have seen a reduction in face-to-face teaching.

Maintaining overall standards roughly at last year’s level recognises the variability of the experience of different students.  It is the appropriate decision and will help students achieve a good outcome.

Lesley Powell CBE, Chief Executive of North East Learning Trust:

The measures put in place offer a sensible and pragmatic route through the wake of COVID disruption and offer staff and students a clear target for next year.

The approach covers a range of contingencies that will hopefully instill confidence in the exam process and reduce stress for everyone involved. Exams are an important aspect of children’s educational experience, and indeed of growing up; allowing these to continue, in as fair a way as possible, I strongly believe is the right thing to do.

Further information

A survey from online content providerGCSEPodthis week found that two thirds of teenagers thought “knowing which topics will be in the exam” would make exams fairer.

In the same survey, 67% of young people said they would like to see grades being more generous.

Ofqual will work to ensure grading generosity from 2020 is spread evenly between subjects, avoiding different standards between one subject and another. Every subject will therefore receive the same level of generosity so that the approach doesn’t advantage some students over others depending on their subject choice."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/courses-for-jobseekers-are-not-leading-them-into-employment,Press release,Courses for jobseekers are not leading them into employment,Today Ofsted published its 'Skills for employment' report at its first annual learning and skills lecture.,Ofsted,12 July 2012,"As well as the report, some of the issues being discussed today include the trials facing young people wanting to go into further education and the inherent challenges in further education in promoting social mobility and securing economic growth.

The‘Skills for employment’ reportfound that when matching unemployed adults to specific courses, progression to employment was not a high enough priority. Too many programmes focused on achievement of qualifications and courses did not extend to training that lead to job specific skills. When looking at the overall proportion of a total of 10,270 jobseekers spanning 31 different further education providers Ofsted found only 19 per cent were successful in getting a job. Many providers were not offering jobseekers challenging enough courses that were likely to increase their chances of sustained employment.

Matthew Coffey, the National Director of Learning and Skills said:

Currently over 8% of the population are unemployed and latest figures show over 1.41 million of those have been unemployed for more than six months. Ofsted’s Skills for employment report aims to assess the efficiency of the further education and skills sector in matching unemployed adults to courses to develop their skills and enable them to find suitable employment. We found too many courses simply lead on to more courses and do not address the urgency of getting unemployed adults into work.

These issues along with others are being discussed at the first annual Learning and Skills Lecture. Further Education is becoming more and more important in promoting economic prosperity and enabling social mobility by supporting young people and unemployed adults to make the transition into work, improving literacy and numeracy and by providing top quality Apprenticeships.

In August 2011, the government launched a set of new initiatives inviting further education providers to prioritise labour market focused training. The initiatives aimed to support more unemployed people to develop the skills they needed to progress into employment. The report found that some providers were initially slow to respond to the government’s initiatives and were unsure about how they would be held to account over the ways they used their allocated funding. The report also found that although labour market focused training increased employability in the long term, it did not address the urgency for jobseekers to move off benefits into work.

Positively, the most successful providers visited by Ofsted had good links with Jobcentre Plus (JCP) and local employers to increase referrals when matching unemployed adults to specific courses. Successful providers also had expert staff trained in working with unemployed people. These staff demonstrated good skills in referring people to specific courses and made excellent initial assessments and development plans geared towards the barriers unemployed people had preventing them from finding employment.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/help-for-small-businesses-to-stamp-out-fraud,Press release,Help for small businesses to stamp out fraud,New research helping small businesses protect themselves against fraudsters has been published today.,"Home Office, National Fraud Authority and Jeremy Browne",18 September 2012,"The new in-depth study, carried out by the national fraud authority (NFA) and the department for business, innovation and skills (BIS), categorises small businesses by their vulnerability to fraud to determine how and why they become victims.

The research, which found a quarter of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) surveyed had suffered at least one type of fraud or internet crime in the past year, will help develop targeted fraud prevention strategies to help businesses protect themselves and their profits and to trade online confidently.

This research builds on work led by the NFA to introduce stronger anti-fraud controls to business and disrupt and punish fraudsters.

Conducted as part of the national cyber security programme, the research recognises the importance of SMEs to the UK economy, and shows business that knowing how to use new technology and the internet securely can help protect their revenues and drive growth.

Home office minister for crime prevention Jeremy Browne said:

‘For too long online fraud has been seen as a victimless crime or simply a cost of doing business in an internet age, but left unchecked it can cost people their livelihoods.

‘That is why we are determined to combat the fraudsters and scammers who damage British businesses and prey on vulnerable customers, pushing up costs for us all.

‘Part of the solution lies in understanding the extent and nature of the problem and that’s why this research is so valuable in helping the NFA help business strengthen their response to fraud and stop them becoming victims.’

The NFA is a home office agency which works with the counter-fraud community to make fraud more difficult to commit in and against the UK.Working with SMEs is just one part of a range of ongoing awareness and prevention activities aimed at multiple sectors under fighting fraud together - the national plan to reduce and combat fraud in the UK.

This latest research showed that almost two-thirds (63 per cent) of SMEs that had experienced fraud were concerned about becoming a victim again, but many may also be underestimating the threat with one in 10 failing to take any action after suffering an incident. Other findings include:

The NFA and BIS have used the findings of this research to identify six distinct SME segments defined by factors such as awareness of different fraud types, perception of and actual risk, business size and use of online trading. The national small business fraud segmentation will help determine exactly how attitudes, behaviour and other business characteristics contribute to fraud and internet crime risk.

This segmentation will be used to develop activities targeting vulnerable small businesses to increase their capability to prevent fraud and enable them to fully exploit new technology to expand their business.

David Willetts, minister for universities and science, said:

‘Small and medium sized businesses are vital to the UK economy and we want to help them exploit new opportunities. That is why they are an important part of the government’s national cyber security strategy.

‘This research means we can target support at SMEs so they can fully reap the benefits of technology whilst minimising the threats, helping them grow faster and perform better.’

There is already significant support available to small businesses suffering fraud or online crime. For those who want to use the internet confidently, safely and securely the NFA runs Action Fraud, a national service for individuals and businesses to report fraud and internet crime and obtain advice on how best to protect themselves.

Get safe online is a joint initiative between the government, law enforcement and leading businesses, which provides computer users and small businesses with free, independent advice on using the internet safely.

1. The national small business fraud segmentation is today published athttp://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/agencies-public-bodies/nfa/publications/

2. The research consisted of a qualitative stage and then a quantitative stage of 2,392 interviews with key SME decision makers. For the purposes of the research, an SME was defined as a business with up to and including 249 employees.

3. The research follows on from the success of the NFA’s national fraud segmentation of consumers, published in June 2011, which was used to inform the recent successful The devil’s in your details campaign. This awareness raising campaign consisted of online videos and a facebook application targeted at two consumer groups to highlight the importance of protecting personal information.

4. Prevention activity is overseen by the fraud prevention awareness steering group, which is led by the NFA and comprises partners in government, law enforcement and the private and voluntary sectors with responsibility for coordinating and maximising the impact of fraud prevention initiatives.

‘I would also like to thank David Normington for his excellent leadership of the Home Office over recent years and for his outstanding record of public service during a highly distinguished career.’

Commenting on her new role, Dame Helen Ghosh said: ‘I am very much looking forward to supporting the Home Secretary as she takes forward her radical policy programme, and to building on David Normington and his team’s terrific work over the past few years to ensure that the Home Office has the capability to deliver.’

Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘I am delighted that Dame Helen Ghosh will be joining the Home Office as Permanent Secretary. She has a huge amount of experience in numerous departments across Whitehall and will, I am sure, make an invaluable contribution to the department as we deliver the vital reforms that are underway. I am very much looking forward to working with her.

‘I would also like to thank Sir David Normington for the years of hard work, dedication and leadership he has given to the Home Office and I wish him well for the future.’

Dame Helen Ghosh took up her current post as Permanent Secretary for Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) in November 2005. She successfully led Defra when the Department was dealing with a number of challenges such as difficulties at the Rural Payments Agency, avian flu and climate change pressures. She effectively delivered a major change programme to transform the Department, both in terms of significant improvements to its finance and its HR functions, and to introduce a radical new project-based operating model. Prior to Defra, she held a range of senior operational and policy roles in HMRC, DWP, Cabinet Office and was the Secretariat for the Machinery of Government, advising the Cabinet Secretary, No 10 and Government departments on a range of issues.

Sir David Normington has been permanent secretary at the Home Office since January 2006, having previously been Permanent Secretary at the Department for Education and Skills since 2001.  Before that he was Director General Schools, responsible between 1998 and 2001 for raising standards in schools.

His career began in the Department of Employment where he was responsible various programmes for trade union reform, for measures to reduce unemployment and for youth training.  He was Principal Private Secretary to Tom King, Secretary of State for Employment in 1983 and 1984.  He was also responsible for coordinating the efforts of central Government to regenerate the seven most deprived London Boroughs

In 1995, when the Department of Employment and Department for Education merged, he played a central role in the creation of the new Department for Education and Employment (DfEE).  From there he moved on to become DfEE’s Director General of Strategy and Analytical Services and for the International Division in the run-up to the UK Presidency of the European Union.

Following an external competition, Sir David was recently been selected as the Government’s preferred candidate for the appointment to the dual role of First Civil Service Commissioner and Commissioner for Public Appointments in succession to Dame Janet Paraskeva and Dame Janet Gaymer. His appointment will be formalised following final approval from Her Majesty the Queen."

The UK’s major internet service and mobile providers, namely BT/EE, Openreach, Virgin Media, Sky, TalkTalk, O2, Vodafone, Three, Hyperoptic, Gigaclear, and KCOM have all agreed the following commitments, effective immediately:

All providers have committed to working with customers who find it difficult to pay their bill as a result of Covid-19 to ensure that they are treated fairly and appropriately supported.

All providers will remove all data allowance caps on all current fixed broadband services.

All providers have agreed to offer some new, generous mobile and landline packages to ensure people are connected and the most vulnerable continue to be supported. For example, some of these packages include data boosts at low prices and free calls from their landline or mobile.

All providers will ensure that vulnerable customers or those self-isolating receive alternative methods of communication wherever possible if priority repairs to fixed broadband and landlines cannot be carried out.

These commitments are in addition to a range of supportive measures offered by the individual providers to their customers affected by circumstances arising from Covid-19.

Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said:

It’s fantastic to see mobile and broadband providers pulling together to do their bit for the national effort by helping customers, particularly the most vulnerable, who may be struggling with bills at this difficult time.

It is essential that people stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives. This package helps people to stay connected whilst they stay home.

Melanie Dawes, CEO of Ofcom said:

We recognise providers are dealing with unprecedented challenges at the moment. So we welcome them stepping up to protect vulnerable customers, at a time when keeping in touch with our friends and families has never been more important. We’ll continue to work with Government and industry to help make sure people stay connected.

Marc Allera, CEO of BT’s Consumer division said:

The service and connectivity that BT provides are more critical today than they ever have been in our lifetime. During this national and global crisis, our priorities are the safety of our colleagues and ensuring that our customers, particularly those that are vulnerable, stay connected. Within the last week or so we focused on implementing a range of initiatives and additional services for our most vulnerable customers and we are pleased to support these sector-wide commitments.

None of this happens without the dedication of our brilliant teams. I’m particularly grateful to our committed contact centre colleagues who are fielding unprecedented call volumes and helping our customers stay connected.

Clive Selley, CEO of Openreach said:

With connections to more than 24 million customer premises across the UK, we know our network is critical.We’ll do everything we can to keep people connected while prioritising our support for critical public services, vulnerable customers and those without a working line.

Thankfully a large amount of the work we do – including fixing faults, adding capacity and building faster, more reliable full fibre networks - can be completed outside, so you’ll still see Openreach engineers working to maintain service across the UK.

Lutz Schüler, CEO of Virgin Media said:

In these unprecedented times we know how important connectivity is to people’s lives. Alongside the many other steps we’re already taking, we’re committed to helping our most vulnerable customers and ensuring they are supported as much as possible as we work tirelessly to keep the country connected.

Stephen van Rooyen, EVP & CEO, U.K. & Europe, Sky, said:

There has never been a more important time for people to stay connected. We will play our part to help everyone stay in contact with their loved ones and to ensure vulnerable people can access the help and information they need.

Tristia Harrison, CEO of TalkTalk, said:

At this time of uncertainty across the country, nobody should have to worry about connection to friends and loved ones. That’s why TalkTalk is dedicated to treating customers - whether consumers or businesses - with fairness and compassion, so they don’t fear losing service if current circumstances mean they’re struggling financially. We have also established a priority contact line for vulnerable customers, so they can reach us when they need.

At a time where other bills may be going up, TalkTalk will not be adding inflation to standard bills from 1st April. And while people may need to use more landline calls, they will never pay over our low and fixed price package so that there are no nasty surprises.

It’s more important than ever that we all work together to keep Britain connected, and TalkTalk is proud to play our part as a provider of this critical national service.

Mark Evans, CEO of Telefonica UK (O2), said:

I’m delighted to see the industry and government  working together to help the UK at this critical time. At O2 we have long-established policies in place to support our customers, and right now, digital connectivity is more important than ever as we connect our customers to vital services and their loved ones.

Nick Jeffery, CEO of Vodafone UK said:

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/reactor-control-room-moves-to-a-new-home,News story,Reactor control room moves to a new home,Today saw the last of the Dounreay Materials Testing Reactor (DMTR) control room panels shipped off to a new home at a local five-star visitor attraction.,Dounreay,3 December 2014,"The control room panels and control desk have been donated to Caithness Horizons and reconstructed at the museum to form the basis of a new permanent exhibition representing Dounreay’s significant part in Scotland’s industrial heritage.

The project team have developed a special framework to display the control room in the newly refurbished exhibition area and a small amount of restoration work has been carried out ready for display.

In June 1955 construction of the DMTR commenced. It was constructed to test the effects of irradiation on metals. The reactor was contained in a steel pressure vessel, and had a thermal output of 25MWt. It was housed in this type of vessel because of its shape and became known affectionately as the ‘upturned dustbin’.

The construction was completed in February 1958 and DMTR went critical in May 1958, making it the first operational nuclear reactor on Scottish soil. In May 1969, DMTR closed for the last time.

In order to try and preserve and interpret the history of Dounreay for future generations, a Heritage Advisory Panel has been set up between Caithness Horizons, Historic Scotland, High Life Highland, the National Museum of Scotland, the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland and DSRL.

One of the main functions of the Heritage Advisory Panel is to ensure that objects collected at Dounreay are given to the appropriate museum and preserved for future generations to enjoy.

The new exhibition is a welcome addition to Caithness Horizons and will be open to the public in the new year with an official opening in the spring. Funding for the new interpretation panels has been secured from Museums Galleries Scotland.

Joanne Howdle, curator of Caithness Horizons, said:

We are delighted to house the DMTR panels as part of the new Dounreay exhibition area. It’s vital that Dounreay’s unique heritage is preserved and displayed for our visitors and future generations to appreciate and enjoy.

Over the decades, Dounreay has had a massive impact on the local area and plays a significant part in the industrial heritage of Caithness and north Sutherland. These panels complement the existing Dounreay story in our museum and form a striking vision in our newly extended exhibition."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/funding-for-deprived-pupils-set-to-double,Press release,Funding for deprived pupils set to double,Details about a rise in the pupil premium fund.,Department for Education and Sarah Teather,19 September 2011,"The total funding available for the Pupil Premium is set to double and will rise to £1.25bn in 2012-13.

The Pupil Premium began to be allocated to schools this year and is targeting funding at pupils from low income families who generally do not achieve as well as pupils from more advantaged backgrounds. Government funding will support them in reaching their potential and help schools reduce educational inequalities.

Children’s Minister Sarah Teather confirmed that the total funding available for the Pupil Premium will be £1.25bn in 2012-13. This is a rise from £625m in 2011-12, and will rise again each year until 2014-15 when it will be worth £2.5bn.

Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said:

The amount the Government is making available through the Pupil Premium will double next year and I am delighted to announce this increase. It shows this Government’s commitment to reforming funding for schools to make it fairer for the most deprived children.

It is our responsibility to close the gulf in achievement, where the poorest children are almost three times less likely to leave school with five good GCSEs than their richer classmates.

This extra funding will help tackle inequality and make sure thousands of children get the extra support they need to succeed and reach their potential.

Per pupil allocations and how the Pupil Premium will be distributed in 2012-13 has not yet been finalised. This will be announced in due course.

The Pupil Premium is in addition to main school funding provided through Dedicated Schools Grant.

The method for determining eligibility for the premium and therefore the allocation per pupil in 2012-13 is subject to the school funding consultation.

From this year the school performance tables will include information that holds schools better to account for the contribution they make towards narrowing the gap in attainment between pupils from low income families and their more advantaged peers. This will also help demonstrate the impact of the Pupil Premium.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dounreay-lets-43m-contract-for-waste-disposal-plant,News story,Dounreay lets £4.3m contract for waste disposal plant,Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd has awarded a £4.3 million contract to design and build a plant for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste.,Dounreay,22 May 2012,"GRAHAM Construction will design and build a plant to encapsulate waste in grout inside containers before the containers are placed in a series of underground disposal vaults currently under construction.

Stewart Henderson, project manager at DSRL, said:

Workers who are dismantling the site collect much of the low-level radioactive waste in drums.

The drums are checked, compacted and the ‘pucks’ stacked inside metal containers. These containers are stored on the site at present. In 2014 we intend to begin emplacing the containers in the ground in a series of vaults now under construction.

This plant will grout up the inside of each container to fill the void spaces between the pucks before the container is moved into the vault.

As the vault fills up, we’ll grout the spaces in between each container as well, before the whole area is covered in concrete.

It’s all about getting the waste into a condition that is safe for future generations and this plant is a key part of that.

Items small enough to be drummed will fill an estimated 7000 containers, each weighing some 40 tonnes after grouting. Currently, the site has 750 containers in store ready for grouting and disposal.

Work on the design of the plant gets underway this week and construction is due to begin next summer. It is expected to take five months to complete.

The contract – issued on behalf of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority – was tendered through the Official Journal of the European Union.

GRAHAM Construction is also the main contractor for the construction of the first two disposal vaults.
GRAHAM has maximised the use of local labour, equipment and materials since commencing work on the project last year and is seeking to utilise the skills and experience of local companies wherever possible on the latest contract.

Leo Martin, Director at GRAHAM said:

This latest contract award is a real endorsement of the work GRAHAM has already undertaken on the site at Dounreay.

We are already making significant progress on the construction of the two sub-surface vaults for the disposal of solid low-level radioactive waste from the site clean-up.

The restoration of Dounreay is a massive undertaking and the work we have undertaken gives us a tremendous platform for attracting further work in the nuclear industry both in Scotland and across the UK.

The disposal of waste from the site’s decommissioning is expected to begin in 2014 and will continue until the site has been cleared by 2022-25.

It’s estimated the clean-up and demolition of the site will generate up to 175,000 cubic metres of low-level radioactive waste."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-industry-backed-plans-to-boost-computer-science-teaching-and-help-britain-compete-in-the-world,Press release,New industry-backed plans to boost computer science teaching and help Britain compete in the world,Details of the plan to improve the teaching of computer science.,Department for Education and The Rt Hon Michael Gove,19 October 2012,"As part of the government’s mission to ensure Britain competes and thrives in the global race, Education Secretary Michael Gove today set out plans to boost the teaching of computer science by training up the first generation of outstanding new teachers in this vital subject.

This comes as the government announces the end of funding for the current outdated information and communications technology (ICT) teacher training courses, to make way for new computer science courses from September 2013.

Top graduates will be enticed into a career in teaching with a new prestigious £20,000 scholarship programme set up with BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT and supported by industry experts such as Microsoft, Facebook, BT and IBM.

Industry experts, working with education professionals, have also for the first time ever set out the requirements for the subject knowledge and attributes all new computer science teachers should have before they start their training. This includes being able to demonstrate an understanding of key computer science concepts and approaches such as algorithms, data representation and logic.

This is all part of the government’s drive to recruit and train a new cadre of teachers with the expertise and enthusiasm to drive improvement in the quality of computer science teaching in schools.

A recent Royal Society report looking at computing education in UK schools found teaching was ‘highly unsatisfactory’. It said that many pupils were not inspired by what they were being taught and gained nothing beyond basic digital literacy skills such as how to use a word-processor or a database.

Education Secretary Michael Gove said:

Computer science is not just a rigorous, fascinating and intellectually challenging subject. It is also vital to our success in the global race.

If we want our country to produce the next Sir Tim Berners-Lee - creator of the World Wide Web - we need the very best computer science teachers in our classrooms. They need to have the right skills and deep subject knowledge to help their pupils.

Around 50 scholarships worth £20,000 each will be available in the first year. Any graduate with a 2.1 or first class degree will be eligible to apply for the scholarship to do a computer science Initial Teacher Training (ITT) course.

Working with experts in the industry and in teaching practice, BCS will award scholarships to candidates with exceptional subject knowledge, enthusiasm for the study of computer science as well as an outstanding potential to teach. BCS’s relationship with the scholars will continue into their teaching careers to develop a cadre of outstanding computer science teachers who are part of a community across schools, universities and industry.

Bill Mitchell, Director of BCS Academy of Computing, said:

The UK needs far more technology creators and entrepreneurs if we are to stay competitive in the global economy. That means students need to be taught not just how software and hardware works, but also how to create new digital technology for themselves.

The best way to do that is to have outstanding computer science teachers in as many schools as possible, which is why these new initiatives are so important.

Ian Livingstone, Life President of Eidos and Chair of Next Gen Skills, said:

Having dedicated, high-calibre computer science teachers in schools will have a powerful effect. They will inspire and enable children to be creators of technology rather than being simply passive users of it. Whether it’s making games, fighting cyber-crime or designing the next jet propulsion engine, computer science is at the heart of everything in the digital world in which we live. It is essential knowledge for the 21st century.

The BCS scholarship comes as part of the government’s teacher training strategy, Training our next generation of outstanding teachers. It follows on from the success of the physics scholarship with the Institute of Physics, a recent announcement of a new scholarship with the Royal Society of Chemistry.

The plans announced today also include:

The network will help forge long-term links between schools, top universities involved in computer science and employers. Around 540 schools have already registered interest in the network and top university computer science departments including those at Cambridge, Imperial and Manchester and employers such as Microsoft, BT and IBM have also signed up.

Professor Chris Bishop, Distinguished Scientist at Microsoft Research, said:

Microsoft is passionate about improving the way that we teach technology in schools, but also how we use technology to teach. As founding members of the Computing at School working group, we’ve been working to inspire both teachers and young people about the importance of computer science for a number of years.

Scholarships such as those announced today will be vital in ensuring that the UK maintains a healthy pipeline of computer science talent, which can only be a positive thing for this country’s future prosperity.

Simon Milner, Facebook’s Director of Public Policy for UK & Ireland, said:

Facebook welcomes the scholarship programme for teachers announced by the government today. It is a positive step to help get high quality computer science teachers in schools, and therefore ensure more young people gain the right skills to join and lead our digital industries.

We get excited by how the work of Facebook engineers and outside developers is transforming the way millions of people communicate, so we can’t wait to share our passion and expertise in this area to inspire the next generation.

Simon Peyton-Jones, Chair of the Computing at School Working Group (CAS) and Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research, said:

We need to attract outstanding new computer science teachers, and we must support our existing ICT teachers as they start to teach the subject. CAS fully supports today’s announcements, which give unmistakeable government support to both these challenges. We look forward to playing our part, and working with government to make a substantial and lasting improvement to our children’s education in the vital subject.

Mr Stoddart will work closely with the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) investigation into police conduct in the aftermath of the disaster and will include organisations outside the IPCC’s remit.

Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘The findings of the Hillsborough Independent Panel were truly shocking, but while the families have now been given the truth, they have not yet received justice.

‘Jon Stoddart is a skilled and dedicated investigator who will bring a huge amount of policing experience to this demanding job.

‘I am giving the IPCC new powers to investigate police misconduct, but this investigation will ensure no body with responsibility for fan safety at Hillsborough will escape scrutiny.

‘I am determined to see a swift and thorough response to the findings of the Hillsborough Panel to deliver justice for the 96 football fans who died and the families who have fought so hard on their behalf.’

Mr Stoddart will be able to recruit investigators and staff to his team, but he will not be allowed to employ officers or former officers with any prior connection to the Hillsborough Disaster, nor those who have worked in West Midlands, South Yorkshire or Merseyside police forces.

He will be required to work closely with the IPCC investigation and pass any findings of misconduct against officers to IPCC investigators to ensure the police are not being investigated by the police.

Jon Stoddart said: ‘I am aware of the great significance and personal responsibility which comes with leading this criminal investigation.

‘My first priority is to meet with as many of the families as possible and to establish a working open relationship with them throughout the investigation.

‘I have held a number of meetings already and have been struck by the families’ humility and steadfast determination to see justice delivered for their loved ones. My role is to ensure that we determine exactly what happened in the lead up to and on  the day of the disaster and establish where any culpability lies.

‘The report by the Hillsborough Independent Panel represents a quite dramatic development in what is known about the disaster and clearly adds significantly to the investigation.

‘There are a number of stages in the investigation and I will be working very closely with the Home Office and especially the IPCC to ensure we are working in a coordinated and integrated manner and that we resource the enquiry appropriately. Then we can start making some real progress.’

In addition to announcing the new investigation, the Home Secretary also revealed a Liaison Board will be established to bring together all organisations working to deliver justice for the Hillsborough families. It will help meet the government’s pledge to deliver swift results by ensuring work and information is shared.

Further scrutiny of the investigations will be performed by an Independent Challenge Panel to be established by the IPCC and the Director of Public Prosecutions. It will include independent experts nominated by family organisations and will also provide scrutiny of the Crown Prosecution Service’s role in the investigations."

The Home Office has made up to £9 million available in funding which will be used to help organisations both inform vulnerable individuals about the need to apply for settled status and support them to complete their applications to protect their status as the UK exits the EU.

The successful organisations, including disability and homeless charities and a wide-range of community organisations will provide support to an estimated 200,000 people, who may be marginalised or in need of extra help.

The funding comes as the Home Office confirmed it had now received more than 400,000 applications to the EU Settlement Scheme.

Home Secretary Sajid Javid said:

EU citizens have contributed so much to this country and we want them all to stay. That’s why we have made the EU Settlement Scheme free and simple to use.

It’s vital no one is left behind and we support vulnerable people who may have difficulties applying.

This £9million of funding will help do that.

Those who may require additional support include victims of human trafficking or domestic abuse, those with severe mental health conditions, those without a permanent address, and those who are elderly and isolated.

Over the last year, officials have met with experts from more than 200 community groups, voluntary sector bodies and businesses nationwide that have strong local links with vulnerable EU citizens to inform them about the EU Settlement Scheme and to make sure that we reach everyone.

Additional support is also available to those EU citizens in the UK who do not have the appropriate access, skills or confidence to apply. This includesover 200 assisted digital locations across the UKwhere applicants can be supported through their application.

The EU Settlement Scheme is designed to make it straightforward for EU citizens and their family members to stay after the UK leaves the EU.

They only need to complete 3 key steps - prove their identity, show that they live in the UK, and declare any criminal convictions. Deal or no deal, EU citizens will have until at least 31 December 2020 to apply.

Full details of all the organisations receiving funding will be published on GOV.UK in due course.

The Home Office will be publishing a full report on the public beta test phase shortly. Further information will be published in statistical updates and a more detailed quarterly official statistics publication from August 2019."

Seventeen local sports clubs, representing more than 1,700 competitors in sports as diverse as cycling, canoeing, rugby and athletics, have come together to develop plans for a new sports complex in the town.

Cavendish Nuclear, one of the parent companies at Dounreay, has given the group the services of a professional project manager to take forward their proposal.

Shona Kirk is working part-time on the plans, which will be on show to the public at a community drop-in session in North Highland College in Thurso on October 6.

The £2 million development would include a four-lane running track and indoor sports hall equivalent in size to 4 badminton courts.

Consultants appointed by Highland Council identified a suitable site in central Thurso.

The land, which is in the ownership of Highland Council and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, was used previously by the now-demolished Dounreay Sports and Social Club.

The NDA says it is ready to hand the site over for development if the community comes up with a viable proposal.

Subject to planning permission and successful funding applications, the new facility could be up and running by the end of 2016.

Shona said:

Caithness has a proud record of producing gifted sports people but many have been forced to travel long distances to develop their skills at suitable training facilities.

This project has the potential to fill an important gap and broaden opportunities for many more to develop their full sporting potential.

It’s also an excellent opportunity for those working on the closure of Dounreay – Cavendish Nuclear and the NDA – to support new infrastructure that will enhance Thurso and Caithness as a place to live and work into the future."

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-drugs-strategy,Press release,New drugs strategy,Recovery revolution backed by tough enforcement is central to new drugs strategy,Home Office and The Rt Hon James Brokenshire,8 December 2010,"An ambitious new strategy with an uncompromising drive to crack down on those involved in the drugs trade, at the same time as revolutionising treatment services to offer recovery as a route out of dependency, was unveiled today by minister for crime prevention James Brokenshire.

In a major policy shift,the strategyputs drug free recovery at the heart of the Government’s response and puts more responsibility on individuals to seek help and overcome their dependency.

The new cross-government approach will also see a renewed focus on reducing demand and restricting supply through:

James Brokenshire said: ‘Drugs ruin lives and cause misery to families and communities across the country. There are no quick fixes, what we want to achieve is a generational shift, to get people to take responsibility for their actions and free themselves from the vicious cycle of drug and alcohol dependency.

‘Today’s message is clear, simply focusing on reducing the harms cause by illicit drug use is no longer enough - we must focus on recovery as the most effective route out of dependency.

‘We will also tighten the net on unscrupulous drug dealers, introduce temporary banning orders to allow us to take immediate action against new legal highs, protect vulnerable young people by preventing them from falling into a cycle of dependency, and encourage record numbers into treatment.’Power and accountability to tackle drugs and the harms they cause will be passed to local areas. With the introduction of Police and Crime Commissioners, the reform of the NHS and the creation of Public Health England, local partnerships will be responsible for designing and commissioning services that meet the needs of their communities.

Public health minister Anne Milton said: ‘It is vital we do all we can to prevent people using drugs in the first place. Those who do must have access to the services they need to help them to re-build their lives and contribute productively to society.

‘Recovery is at the heart of our new approach. As set out in our White Paper, the system will be locally owned and led by Directors of Public Health and local government. We will work with individuals and their families to offer them a clear route to out of dependence.

‘But we are keen to do more. That is why we will work with local areas to pilot a payment by results scheme to incentivise recovery and drive success.’

The strategy also sets out a new holistic approach to supporting people dependant on drug or alcohol, not just through treatment, but also by addressing offending, employment and housing issues, all of which are closely linked to drug or alcohol abuse.

Work and pensions minister, Maria Miller, said: ‘This strategy will take a holistic approach to helping benefit claimants beat their drug and alcohol dependency, so they have every chance of competing in today’s labour market.

‘Those who decide to go into treatment will be offered every support to help overcome their addiction, but those who refuse it will face the same benefit sanctions as every other jobseeker.

‘Our welfare reforms will support this strategy by making sure that work always pays.’

We will:

Working across government to reduce demand through prevention, restricting supply through tough enforcement and supporting individuals into recover, will help us achieve our goal of stronger, safer communities free from the harm of drugs.

now. This includes arrangements on residency, healthcare, pensions and education, social
security coordination and mutual recognition of professional qualifications. Over 15,000
nationals from EEA EFTA countries living in the UK and approximately 17,000 UK nationals
living in the EEA EFTA countries will benefit from these arrangements.

As these countries participate in the single market and other EU-led initiatives, this
agreement will mirror a small number of the other relevant separation issues that we have
agreed with the EU in the Withdrawal Agreement. The separation issues covered by this
agreement are: arrangements on goods placed on the UK or EEA EFTA markets, intellectual
property, ongoing police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, data protection, public
procurement, and ongoing judicial procedures. This is significant, given that total UK trade
with the EEA EFTA states amounted to almost £30bn in 2017.

The agreement will be concluded before exit day and, alongside the EU Withdrawal
Agreement, it will be legislated for through the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill. However,
the rights and obligations of the EEA Agreement and other international agreements with
these countries will continue to apply to the UK for the duration of the implementation period.
This means that businesses and citizens will face no immediate changes in existing rules.
EEA EFTA nationals living in the UK will be able to apply to the UK’s Settlement Scheme in
the same way as EU citizens.

In the unlikely event of ‘no deal’ with the EU, the UK would still pursue a citizens’ rights
agreement with the EEA EFTA states. We are discussing this with the EEA EFTA states. In
any scenario, EFTA nationals will be able to stay in the UK post-exit.

The Governments of the UK, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein issued the following joint
statement on this announcement:

We are pleased to have reached this agreement. It will
protect the rights of our citizens as the UK leaves the EU, and it will provide certainty to
businesses. We want to put in place new arrangements from the end of the implementation
period to protect our historic relationships, including in the area of trade.

The Independent Family Returns Panel makes recommendations to the UK Border Agency on the best method of returning individual families to their home country, ensuring the specific welfare needs of children are met.

Following an open recruitment process, Immigration Minister Damian Green has appointed 11 panel members including the chair, Chris Spencer, a former Director of Education and Children’s Services in the London Borough of Hillingdon.

Other panel members include former directors of local authority children’s services departments, members of Local Safeguarding Children Boards, a former head teacher and doctors who will be able to provide professional medical advice.

Damian Green said:

‘Our more humane approach to family returns places the welfare of children at the heart of the process and the Independent Family Returns Panel has a vital role to play.

‘These appointments mean that our decisions will continue to be guided by a group which boasts an exceptional level of expertise, experience and dedication to the welfare of children.

‘We always take a compassionate approach in this sensitive area of our work but individuals with no legal right to be in the UK must return home.’

The appointments announced today mean that the panel now exists in its full form, having operated on an interim basis since March 2011.

Mr Green also announced today that representatives of the UK Border Agency and Department for Education who sat on the panel as interim members during its initial phase are to withdraw from full panel membership. UK Border Agency officials will continue to support the panel, providing operational information and answering the questions of panel members.

Chair Chris Spencer said:

‘Once the decision has been taken that a family has no right to remain in the UK it is important that the plan to remove them reflects the children’s best interests and considers carefully any safeguarding issues.

‘I am pleased that independent members appointed to the panel bring with them years of experience from across the children’s landscape including the police, local authorities, health services and the third sector which will ensure that this happens.’



Minister of State for Children and Families Sarah Teather said:

‘The reforms to the immigration system for children and families have been about putting compassion and children’s welfare at its heart.

‘The appointment of members to the full panel contributes to that by ensuring that there is independent expertise on how best to manage returns of individual families.’

The panel is one part of a wider process designed to ensure families with no right to remain in the UK are returned to their home countries with dignity, ensuring the welfare of children at all times.

The new approach emphasises close engagement with families and provides a range of structured opportunities for them to take up assisted return or leave of their own volition, to make further representations or seek further legal redress.

1. The government committed to the ending of child detention for immigration purposes. In December 2010, it unveiled a new compassionate approach to family removals, following a wide-reaching review and consultation led by the UK Border Agency in partnership with the Department for Education.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-rolls-out-the-red-carpet-for-entrepeneurs-and-investors,Press release,Government rolls out the red carpet for entrepeneurs and investors,"Home Office announced new visa rules that will reward those who will contribute to economic growth, such as entrepreneurs and investors.",Home Office and The Rt Hon Damian Green,16 March 2011,"Foreign entrepreneurs and investors are being given extra incentive to come to the UK today after the Home Office announced new visa rules that will reward those who will contribute to economic growth.

Under the new rules, those who come to the UK and invest large sums of money will be given the right to settle permanently in the UK faster.

Those who invest £5m will be allowed to settle here after three years and those that invest £10m or more will be allowed to settle after two.

This compares with the minimum five year requirement that is currently in place.

Entrepreneurs will also be able to settle in the UK more quickly if they create ten jobs or turn over £5m in a three year period.

Damian Green immigration minister said: ‘Today I have sent out a clear message - the UK remains open for business and we want those who have the most to offer to come and settle here.

‘Entrepreneurs and investors can play a major part in our economic recovery and I want to do everything I can to ensure that Britain remains an attractive destination for them.‘Last year we issued far too few visas to those who wish to set up a business or invest in the UK - I intend to change that.’

It was also announced today that a new visit visa will be created for prospective entrepreneurs.

This will allow them to enter the UK in order to secure their funding and make arrangements for starting their business before they transfer onto a full entrepreneur visa in country.

While the standard investment threshold for an entrepreneur to qualify for a visa will remain at £200,000, the government will also make provision for high potential businesses to come to the UK with £50,000 in funding from a reputable approved organisation - for example venture capitalists, including angel investors, or through seed competitions.

Major investors will also enjoy more flexibility as they will be allowed to have spent up to 180 days a year, rather than 90, outside of the UK before they lose their right to settlement. This addresses a major concern that investors often cite as they need to be constantly mobile.

Those investors who are already in the UK now and have invested large sums will also qualify for accelerated settlement.

Separately, the government has also published a statement of policy outlining how the new ‘exceptional talent’ route under tier one of the points based system will operate from April this year.

This new innovative route for exceptionally talented migrants, which will be limited to 1,000 visas under the annual limit, will facilitate those who have already been recognised or have the potential to be recognised as a leader in the fields of science, arts and humanities.

Migrants seeking entry under the tier one exceptional talent category will not need to be sponsored by an employer but will need to be endorsed by an accredited competent body.

It will be for each competent body, who will be announced in the near future, to select those who will qualify for endorsement.

Those admitted under the tier one exceptional talent category will initially be granted three years and four months leave.  They will be able to extend their stay for a further two years and settlement will be available after five years residence in the UK.Damian Green immigration minister added: ‘Our new exceptional talent route will ensure that we continue to allow the brightest and the best who can make a valued contribution into the UK.‘This comes at a time of major reform to the immigration system to bring net migration back down to the tens of thousands.’

The government has made clear its commitment to supporting a private sector led economic recovery. For growth to be strong and sustainable, the economy must be rebalanced to support private sector jobs, exports and investment.

UKTI will ensure that would-be entrepreneurs across the world will be made aware of this brilliant new initiative, which will help make the UK the best place in the world for someone with a bright idea to start a business.

UKTI will use their entrepreneur networks and marketing channels to ensure that the news about the new entrepreneur visa is heard across the globe.

Micha-Rose Emmett, Associate of Henley & Partners Ltd said: ‘We applaud the Home Office on the introduction of these new rules for the investor and entrepreneur categories. This is evidence that the UK is becoming again a key player in investor immigration worldwide.

‘With these changes, high net worth individuals will be more likely to chose UK as their preferred country to reside as the physical presence requirements have been sensibly relaxed. The investment opportunity becomes more interesting for investors and this is a very encouraging prospect for the future of the country. International wealthy individuals and families need effective interesting solutions that can be implemented swiftly and this new policy give these people those possibilities, which in turn will attract significant capital to the UK.’

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/brakes-are-off-as-dounreay-reactor-clean-up-moves-forward,News story,Brakes are off as Dounreay reactor clean-up moves forward,Engineers at Dounreay have raided a scrap car and a kitchen can opener to help decommission one of the site’s reactors.,Dounreay,18 December 2017,"The handbrake from a vintage 1968 Ford Cortina has been used to help steer a camera, attached to wheels taken from can openers, into the Prototype Fast Reactor (PFR) where a detailed survey inside the plant was completed.

Physical space constraints and radiological conditions make it impossible for workers to access, meaning photographs play a key role in understanding how best to proceed with dismantling the redundant facility.

Chris Irwin, Senior Design Engineer, came up with the inventive approach:

“I was opening a can of beans at home and realised that the cutting wheel of a can opener was exactly what was needed to make the required diamond shaped wheel.

“I bought 4 of them and took the wheels off. The camera needed to be guided over obstacles within the reactor, so we realised the incremental nature of the clicks on a handbrake would give us the precise control that we needed.”

This is the latest in a long line of novel approaches developed by the company’s workforce with blu-tack and Cillit Bang among the everyday items that have previously been used to help deliver safe clean-up while ensuring that the best value is achieved on behalf of the site’s owner, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.

Chris added:

“We are delivering one of the most challenging closure programmes in Europe, but this is another example where innovative, simple solutions prove critical in safely delivering complex projects.”

PFR is one of three reactors at the former centre of fast reactor research. It was closed down in 1994, 20 years after it began producing power and is the process of being decommissioned."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/plans-take-shape-for-europes-deepest-nuclear-clean-up,News story,Plans take shape for Europe’s deepest nuclear clean-up,Plans for Europe’s deepest nuclear clean-up are to go on public display ahead of an application for permission to start construction work in 2013.,Dounreay,7 September 2012,"The plans will show how radioactive waste is to be retrieved from two underground facilities – a vertical shaft 65 metres deep and a nearby vault set nine metres into the ground – as part of the closure of the Dounreay site.

The water-filled shaft and silo were used in the 20th century for radioactive waste from some of Britain’s earliest experiments with nuclear energy.

Their clean-out is a key part of the site closure contract awarded by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority to the Babcock Dounreay Partnership earlier this year.

It aims to complete both facilities by 2021, several years earlier than previous forecasts and at less cost to the NDA through innovation in areas such as waste packaging.

An estimated 1500 tonnes of radioactive waste was consigned to the two facilities between 1957 and 1998.

Radiation levels are too high for man-entry to either facility, so robotic equipment will be used to retrieve, analyse, shred and package the waste.

Separate headworks and waste processing facilities will be built above each facility.

A 60-strong team is now working on the project, with employment levels expected to peak at about 200 during the construction phase in 2013-16.

The project team is looking wherever possible to use technology already proven elsewhere such as remote vehicles, cranes, shredders, remotely-operated grabs, water treatment, assay and monitoring.

They will solidify the processed waste in a type of container that is new to Dounreay but proven by the nuclear industry in other parts of the world.

The use of boxes made from steel, lead and concrete will provide shielding from harmful radiation and remove the need to build a heavily-shielded store for the previous design of containers. This will save tens of millions of pounds in design and build costs.

About 20 companies are likely to be involved in contracts ranging from the design and build of mechanical systems such as cranes to the procurement of robotics capable of operating in high radiation zones, major construction, plant decommissioning and back-filling of the shaft and silo.

The project is being managed by Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd, the site licence company acquired earlier this by the Babcock Dounreay Partnership, for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.

Project director Bo Wier, who has been seconded from CH2MHILL, one of the parent companies in the partnership, said: “Emptying the shaft and silo at Dounreay is one of the biggest clean-up challenges in Europe and one of the priorities for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority in the UK.

“We believe we can deliver the decommissioning on an earlier timescale and at lower cost than previously thought by combining proven, off-the-shelf technology with innovation in design.

“By 2021, we aim to have all the waste safely packaged for long-term storage above ground and both facilities left in a condition that do not pose a hazard to future generations. This is significantly earlier than previous estimates and offers substantial cost savings to the NDA.”

Earlier work carried out to decommission both facilities, including hydraulic isolation of the shaft, means construction work can begin quickly once planning permission is obtained.

DSRL is putting the plans on display locally in Reay on Tuesday, September 11, and in Thurso on Thursday, September 13 before making a formal application to Highland Council in October. DSRL is planning to hold an event for the supply chain in the near future to map out procurement opportunities.

Subject to consent, construction work is scheduled to begin in the second half of 2013 and take up to three years complete. Retrieval of waste is expected to take 18 months to complete at the silo and 30 months at the shaft, before both facilities are back-filled with concrete.

Failure to provide this information could cost occupational workplace pension scheme trustees up to £50,000 from April 2018.

Up to 10 million people could benefit from the move.

This is the next step the government is taking to ensure savers receive good value for money from their pension, that their pension will meet their needs for retirement, and that savers are better able to maximise savings.

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions David Gauke said:

The government is beginning to address a fundamental imbalance that exists in the pensions industry.

For too long savers have been in the dark about where their pension is invested, what they are paying for, and why they are paying it.

I want people to have a strong sense of personal ownership over their pension savings. These proposals do just that and will open the industry.

By giving people the tools to better understand their options and compare value for money, I believe we are creating a generation of smarter, more informed savers.

Today’s announcement comes on the back of thelatest pension charges surveywhich shows that 98% of eligible members are at or below the 0.75% cap introduced by government.

However with the survey also showing a clear lack of transparency on some costs in pension schemes, the government is proposing that members receive an annual benefit statement where they can find the costs and charges for their scheme.

Publication of charge and transaction cost information will enable pension scheme trustees and others to compare the value for money they are receiving with their peers, thereby driving better market outcomes.

Government will also compel schemes to publish an illustration of the compounding effect of the costs and charges affecting their pension savings.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will consult on corresponding rules for workplace personal pensions in the new year.

The consultation is open for 6 weeks.

For the first time, communities are also able to access street-by-street information on public disorder and possession of weapons, shoplifting, criminal damage and arson, theft, and drug crime.

Information on offence rates was uploaded today on the police.uk website as part of the government’s commitment to improve transparency across the criminal justice system.

Communities will be able to look up levels of crime and anti-social behaviour in their area and use it to hold their local police, and in time their elected Police and Crime Commissioner, to account.

Nick Herbert, Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice, said:

‘Our crime mapping website, police.uk, has attracted phenomenal interest since its launch earlier this year with more than 430 million hits to date. We want to build on this success and deliver a more transparent and accountable criminal justice system.

‘The addition of further crime categories and easy access to police force performance data will give people the information and power they need to hold their local forces to account and ensure that crime in their area is driven down.

‘Ahead of the introduction of elected Police and Crime Commissioners, crime mapping is just one way in which the government is empowering communities and strengthening the link between the police and the public.’

This compares with 53.4 per cent in all schools in England.

Commenting on the statistics, Schools Minister Nick Gibb said:

Children in alternative provision are among the most vulnerable in education. Following Ofsted’s recent report, these new statistics confirm that many pupils in alterative provision are not receiving the education they need. Of course children excluded from mainstream schools have had a disrupted education, but an alternative education system for those children that results in only 1.4% achieving five good GCSEs including English and Maths is shameful. It is vital the provision they receive addresses pupils’ problems and is of high quality.

As set out in our White Paper, we want to increase the autonomy, accountability and diversity of alternative provision to help drive up standards. For the first time, we have invited applications for alternative provision Free Schools, so that we can provide more high quality provision for vulnerable young people. It is encouraging to see that 34 groups have put forward proposals.

We are also legislating to allow good and outstanding Pupil Referral Units to benefit from the freedoms that Academies enjoy, and allowing others to benefit from similar freedoms as community schools, including control of their own budgets. Through a new pilot starting later this year, schools in the trial will get the power and responsibility to secure high quality alternative provision for excluded pupils.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/50-million-to-help-pupils-get-ready-for-secondary-school,News story,£50 million to help pupils get ready for secondary school,The Deputy Prime Minister announces a new summer school programme for disadvantaged pupils who are due to start secondary school.,Department for Education and The Rt Hon Michael Gove,5 March 2013,"The Deputy Prime Minister today announced a new £50 million pupil premium summer school programme to help the most disadvantaged pupils make the transition from primary to secondary school. The scheme will benefit up to 100,000 pupils per year. They will benefit from two weeks of additional teaching through the scheme.

Pupils can struggle to make the jump to secondary education. Moving to a larger school and having to tackle a more challenging curriculum can be daunting for some pupils and they can suffer as a consequence. This results in a dip in their performance, which can persist throughout their time at school.

The new summer schools will allow schools to pick the pupils in danger of falling back and provide them with two weeks of support and catch-up, so that they start secondary school ready to learn.

All pupils eligible for free school meals who are making the transition between primary and secondary school in September 2012 will attract the extra funding. Schools will make a judgement on which pupils need extra support in making the transition.

Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, said:

Too many pupils experience a dip in performance when they start secondary school. More worryingly, pupils from the poorest backgrounds are the most likely to struggle, meaning that they can underperform throughout their time at school.

What matters is how hard you work and the skills and talents you possess, not the school you went to or the jobs your parents did.

Our new summer school scheme will allow schools to provide support to those pupils most at risk of falling behind. It simply isn’t fair to ignore them, and that is why this Government is intervening to ensure that pupils from the poorest background have the opportunity to succeed.

Michael Gove, Education Secretary, said:

The mission of this coalition government is to make opportunity more equal. We want to take every step to achieve that.

These summer schools are designed to offer additional help to those in need at a crucial time. Nick Clegg is to be applauded as a champion of new ideas to drive forward social mobility.

The Government is making up to £50 million available in 2012/13 for this activity. This will be part of the overall Pupil Premium funding which is being significantly increased next year to £1.25 billion. The remaining £1.2 billion will be allocated per pupil and more detail will be set out in the 2012/13 school funding settlement that we will publish later in the autumn.

There is evidence that summer schools can have a positive impact on students. Summer schools will provide an opportunity for pupils moving up to secondary schools to get additional support tailored to their needs and based on evidence of what will have the greatest benefit before they arrive at their new school.

This scheme is part of the Government’s efforts to narrow the gaps in attainment between those from poorer backgrounds and their better off counterparts. As highlighted in the Government’s social mobility strategy, these gaps in attainment emerge early and widen as children get older.

The pupil premium budget for 2011/12 is £625 million.

Sarah Teather, Minister of State for Children and Families, recently announced the pupil premium budget for 2012/13 will be £1.25 billion. The £50 million will be funded from this amount.

The schemes will run from 2012/13 and then continue every year.

£50 million will be provided to schools through the pupil premium to run summer schools in summer 2012.

The UK already carries out most measures required by the directive.

But opting in will ensure Britain remains a world leader in this area and enshrine in law action that happens routinely.

Home Office minister Damian Green said: ‘Tackling human trafficking is a priority for the government. The UK has an excellent record on fighting human trafficking and the organised criminals who profit from misery.‘The government is determined to build on that. The UK Human Trafficking Centre already works with law enforcement agencies providing valuable tactical advice, intelligence analysis and expertise in anti-trafficking operations 24/7.‘Opting in would send a powerful message to traffickers that Britain is not a soft touch and that we remain world leaders in fighting this terrible crime.’

Today’s move follows a review of the finalised text of the directive.

In June the government said it would not opt in until it was sure the directive would benefit the UK.

A human trafficking strategy will be published in the spring and will focus on:"

See the full press release.

Voluntary registration with the scheme for new employees and job-movers was due to start on 26 July. This registration has now been stopped.

The scheme is being remodelled after businesses, community groups and others said that they believed the current plan was disproportionate, overly burdensome and infringed on civil liberties.

Theresa May said that the safety of children and vulnerable adults is of ‘paramount importance to the new government’, but that a measured approach is vital.

She continued, ‘We’ve listened to the criticisms and will respond with a scheme that has been fundamentally remodelled.

‘Vulnerable groups must be properly protected in a way that is proportionate and sensible. This redrawing of the VBS will ensure this happens.’

Devised as a response to the Bichard enquiry into the Soham murders which called for better information sharing, the VBS was designed to protect children and vulnerable adults by preventing those who pose a known risk from gaining access to them through their work.

The scope of the remodelling process - to be coordinated by the Home Office in partnership with Department of Health and Department for Education - is being finalised and will be announced shortly.

The aim of the ground-breaking research, named Project Minerva, is to reduce the risk to emergency services and front-line troops attending incidents or operations involving hazardous chemical or biological materials. The recent trials, which took place at Gloucestershire Fire Service College, saw concept drones and robots thrown into simulated contaminated scenarios in both UK homeland and battlefield environments. The technology was tested against the speed and accuracy of human response teams supported by specialistDSTLscientists, the military, police and fire services.

Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said:

Following the reckless nerve agent attack in Salisbury this year, we have seen the bravery and professionalism of our Armed Forces, emergency services and MOD scientists. They have worked tirelessly to investigate and clean up deadly contaminated areas. This project will ensure we stay at the forefront of dealing with such heinous attacks, whether on our streets or on foreign battlefields. We are investing millions in this pioneering technology to do more to protect those who so fearlessly protect us.

The Minister of State for Security and Economic Crime, Ben Wallace, said:

I am excited to see the UK being on the front-foot and leading in the development of these autonomous technologies which are secure, reliable and useful for dangerous sites. The potential to protect our responders and protect the public from potentially hazardous scenes is considerable. The UK’s experience and pedigree in security means we are in a prime position to identify what is best placed to tackle the threats of the future.

Project Minerva was launched in September 2016 and has been supported by over £3 million in joint funding over 24 months. The project intends to bring the designs from concept to reality in an accelerated timeframe. The recent trials involved the winning concepts for phase 2 of the project.

The project is led by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL). It is funded jointly by the Ministry of Defence science and technology portfolio and the Home Office and contracted through the Defence and Security Accelerator (DASA) with funding from Defence Science and Technology (DST).

Peter Stockel,DSTL’s autonomy lead, said:

These two weeks of trials see the culmination of over 18 months of work to realise an exciting vision, which could see robots and humans working together in demanding situations and potentially save lives when dealing with incidents involving hazardous substances. In this ‘technology exploration’, we’ve been working with industry and academia to rapidly advance robotic and autonomous solutions to enhance our response options and tools for the near future.

With continued involvement across Government, and demonstration with the user community, we aim to mature this emergent capability to test the ‘art of the possible’ and accelerate this into the hands of the prospective users for further operational evaluation, both for MOD and the Home Office.

Major John Green, Military Advisor CBR Division forDSTL, said:

The military is putting a lot of time and effort into CBRN [chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear] and Minerva could have a significant effect on our capability and potentially decrease the training burden. It is a project for everything else to build on.

The Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson also announced measures to maintain the UK’s world-leading chemical analysis and capability in March, when he outlined £48 million-worth of investment in a new Chemical Weapons Defence Centre atDSTL.

Phase 1 of Project Minerva, which ran for 6 months until July 2017, funded 18 development projects and was worth £1.37 million.

Four teams were then selected to develop their concepts further in this second phase. Just over £1.6 million total funding was awarded to the following phase 2 winners, all of which are small-or-medium-sized enterprises and academic institutions:"

In anews story dated 27 April 2023, the Planning Inspectorate launched a process inviting applicants to express interest in participating in a trial aimed at testing potential components of an enhanced pre-application service for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIP).

Following the invitation on 21 April 2023, the Inspectorate received responses from seven projects that expressed their interest in joining the Early Adopters Programme. The participating projects include:

East Yorkshire Solar Farm

Hynet North West Hydrogen Pipeline

Five Estuaries Offshore Wind Farm

Byers Gill Solar

Tillbridge Solar Project

Outer Dowsing Offshore Wind (Generating Station)

Cory Decarbonisation Project

Confirmation of their participation in the programme was sent to each of these projects on 15 June 2023.

Each of the aforementioned projects will be trialling a minimum of three out of the following ten potential components for the enhanced pre-application service:

1. Use of Programme Planning (mandatory for all projects)

A Programme Plan, including all significant milestones and dependencies, is made publicly available by the applicant with changes communicated to the system promptly.

2. Use of Evidence Plans

An Evidence Plan process is engaged where there are complex/ numerous and substantial Habitats Regulations Assessment and/ or Environmental Impact Assessment issues, driven by the applicant with the Inspectorate in a facilitatory role.

3. Use of Issues Tracking

The tracking of issues at the pre-application stage maintained by the applicant in a way that is accessible to system, culminating in consensus about residual/ ongoing issues for the examination prior to submission of the application.

4. Use of Pre-application Principal Areas of Disagreement Summary Statements (PADSS)

PADSS developed by relevant stakeholders which record an individual stakeholder’s interpretation of the main areas of disagreement at the point the application is submitted, and indicating the potential impacts on the examination. See ‘What happens next?’ below concerning the potential impacts of this and other components on affected stakeholders.

5. Production of Policy Compliance Document (PCD)

A PCD is developed by the applicant to accompany the submitted application, setting out how the requirements of relevant National Policy Statement(s) and other relevant and important policies are satisfied.

6. Demonstrating regard to advice

The applicant to demonstrate in the submitted application how it has had regard to advice issued by the Inspectorate under section 51 of The Planning Act 2008 (PA2008) and other statutory advice issued by affected government agencies.

7. Production of Design Approach Document (DAD)

A DAD is developed by the applicant to accompany the application, in consultation with relevant consultees, setting out how the project satisfies design criteria in eg relevant National Policy Statement(s) and best practice guidance.

8. Production of mature outline control documents

Mature outline control documents (eg Construction Environmental Management Plan) are developed by the applicant, in consultation with relevant consultees, and provided with the submitted application.

9. Use of Advice log

The Inspectorate records all section 51 advice issued to the applicant in log form, as an alternative to narrative meeting notes. Updates are prompt and accessible to system.

10. Use of multiparty meetings

The use of multiparty meetings during pre-application to seek resolution of cross-interest issues or disagreements, driven by the applicant with the Inspectorate in a facilitatory role.

During July, the Inspectorate has scheduled meetings with each of the participating projects to discuss the development of the components indicated in their expressions of interest. Following these meetings it is expected that each applicant will proactively engage relevant stakeholders about how they may be affected by the Early Adopters Programme, establishing if anything new or different will be requested of them, and by when, in order that the components being trialled may be developed in an optimised way.

Applicants and affected stakeholders should note that participation in this trial is voluntary and non-statutory. The ability of relevant stakeholders to engage in the development of specific components forms an integral part of this trial, accounting for resource demand and competing priorities. Adhering to or producing any of the trial elements does not affect the separate statutory tests under section 55 of the Planning Act 2008, which determine whether the application will be accepted for examination.

Once the trials are completed, the Inspectorate will gather feedback on the extent to which the development of each component, individually or in combination, has contributed to an improved examination experience for the system.

Whether or not a project is involved in the Early Adopters Programme, we welcome and encourage receipt of any information in relation to any innovative approaches applicants are taking at the Pre-application stage with a view to making the consenting process smoother. Please discuss these with your allocated NSIP Case Team or provide details tonienquiries@planninginspectorate.gov.ukfor the attention of NSIP Reform."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-looks-to-break-link-between-temporary-and-permanent-migration,Press release,Government looks to break link between temporary and permanent migration,The government sets out proposals looking to break the link between temporary and permanent migration.,Home Office and The Rt Hon Damian Green,9 June 2011,"The government is implementing reforms to the immigration system which will reduce immigration to sustainable levels. Today’s announcement is the next step in this process.

Launching a public consultation on reforms to the work routes leading to settlement, immigration minister Damian Green set out plans to re-classify visas as either ‘temporary’ or ‘permanent’ and introduce stricter criteria for those who want to stay.

Immigration minister Damian Green said:

‘The proposals I am making today are aimed at breaking the link between temporary and permanent migration.

‘Settlement has become almost automatic for those who choose to stay. This needs to change. The immigration system has got to be made to work properly.

‘We want the brightest and best workers to come to the UK, make a strong contribution to our economy while they are here, and then return home.’

Under the current system, many workers are allowed to apply to stay here permanently. In 2010, 84,000 people who entered the UK for employment were granted settlement. This compares to less than 10,000 who qualified for employment related settlement in 1997.

The government has already implemented new settlement requirements for skilled workers entering under Tiers 1 and 2 of the points based system, which require applicants to demonstrate English-language proficiency, continue to meet the salary requirements and to pass a new criminality test.

Key proposals under consideration in the 12 week consultation are as follows:

Damian Green added:

‘A small number of exceptional migrants will be able to stay permanently but for the majority, coming here to work will not lead automatically to settlement in the UK.’

The government has committed to reforming all routes of entry to the UK in order to bring immigration levels under control. The settlement, tier 5 and overseas domestic worker reforms will work alongside the annual limit, the new student visa reforms and changes to the family route which will be consulted on later this year.

He’s salvaging wood from the ornate facings of redundant buildings and turning them into banjos.

Top US banjo player Dwight Diller is among those to have commissioned one.

Neil (38) says it’s a hobby that could grow into a business and provide him with work when his job ends at Dounreay.

He’s one of 1700 staff working on the demolition of the site who’ll lose their jobs over the next decade.

Neil’s job takes him across the 135-acre site supervising work on the dismantling of hundreds of buildings at the site.
He took up the banjo eight years ago and started crafting his own instruments after spotting the quality of wood being stripped from the entrances of redundant 1950s buildings.

His first was presented as a gift for his father’s 60th birthday.

The most recent was a commission from top US musician Dwight Diller for a close friend in England.

Dwight, who intends to use it on tour in the UK, gave Neil free tution at his banjo retreat in West Virginia after playing one of Neil’s instruments at an event in England.

“I’ve always had an interest in design and DIY,” explained Neil. “I took up the banjo in my spare time eight years ago in and it evolved when I saw the wood that was coming off the buildings at Dounreay and thought it could be used again.”

Help is available to workers at the site who want to turn their skills into a new business and Neil says he is now exploring options for a start-up in luthiery."

The Minister for Equalities and Criminal Information visited The Children’s Society in Islington yesterday, London to meet with teenagers who have been supported by the charity’s work around the country.

She heard about their experiences, and talked to them about how the government was helping young people like them through themissing children and adults strategy.

Lynne Featherstone said: ‘The problem of children going missing is bigger than many people realise, with those aged 15 to 17 most likely to go missing, as well as being at risk of harm and exploitation.

‘Hearing the views of children and young people has renewed my determination to ensure we are doing all we can to help and support them.’

The minister heard how two 15-year-old girls succumbed to peer pressure before going missing repeatedly, often feeling scared and vulnerable in some of the situations they found themselves in.

However, they were introduced to a Children’s Society project via their school, and soon found the impartial support and advice they needed to make the change.

The first government strategy to highlight the importance of missing people and provide a core framework for local areas was launched last December.

The minister added: ‘Projects like those run locally by The Children’s Society are a lifeline for young people and just the kind of local contact the strategy advocates.

‘I have been very impressed with the two young girls I met, who have grown into articulate and intelligent young women with the help of local support.’"

Home Secretary Theresa May said, ‘The European Investigation Order will prove to be an invaluable tool in the fight against transnational, international and serious organised crime.

‘We believe - as do prosecutors and the police - that the European Investigation Order will greatly benefit the UK criminal justice system, without compromising civil liberties.’

The EIO proposal was published on 29 April 2010, and the UK opt-in applies to this proposal. A decision on the UK opt-in must be communicated to the presidency of the council by 28 July.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-sets-out-vision-to-support-parents-and-families,Press release,Government sets out vision to support parents and families,Children's Minister Sarah Teather's reforms to early years education.,Department for Education and Sarah Teather,18 July 2011,"Early years qualifications are to be reviewed to make sure they are sufficiently rigorous and high quality, Children’s Minister Sarah Teather announced today as part of wider reforms to early education.

A highly skilled, graduate-led workforce is crucial to making sure children develop well and are ready for school. The government wants to raise the status of the professionals working with young children to make sure they have the skills they need.

The government has also today confirmed that nine local authorities will be the first to trial payment by results for children’s centres. They will test rewards for reaching the most vulnerable families, improving family health and wellbeing, and raising attainment of children at age five.

Today’s announcements are included in a new vision set out by the government for families in the foundation years. Families can access a parent-friendly version by the charity 4Children, Families in the Foundation Years: From Pregnancy to Five, which sets out what mothers and fathers can expect from pregnancy until their child reaches the age of five.

Sarah Teather said:

Parents are the most important influence in a child’s early life. The experiences of children in their earliest years, good or bad, can shape their future life chances for years to come. That’s why we want to support families to bring up their children and raise the status of the foundation years.

Today, with 4Children, we have set out in one place what every mother and father should expect from pregnancy right through to when their child is five. This brings together everything parents need to know to help their child develop well, stay healthy and be ready for school.

Alongside parents, well-qualified and motivated professionals working in the early years can make a real difference to children’s early development. I am today announcing a review of early years qualifications, led by Professor Cathy Nutbrown, to make sure the people working with our youngest children have the skills they need. I also want to encourage more talented people to work in the foundation years and make sure the qualifications they take are rigorous and offer opportunities to progress, as there are in school teaching.

The government has today set out plans to strengthen the early years workforce, including:

The Government has asked Professor Cathy Nutbrown to do an independent review of early years qualifications to consider how to strengthen current qualifications and look at career progression of people working in the foundation years. It will consider how to ensure that new entry qualifications are of a high standard and meet the needs of employers, and offer scope for progression. It will run alongside a review of the standards for awarding the Early Years Professional Status being conducted by the Children’s Workforce Development Council (CWDC).

Earlier this month the government published a revised Early Years Foundation Stage for consultation and set out a new core purpose for children’s centres - more focused on supporting outcomes, particularly for the most vulnerable families. The Government wants local authorities and children’s centres to think more about how they reach and support the most vulnerable families in their areas, and how they can involve parents more actively in running centres.

Nine local authorities, announced today, will become the first to trial payment by results in children’s centres - with up to 21 further trials to be announced early in the autumn. The experience of the trial areas will help the government and local authorities develop a final set of measures so payment by results can be rolled out nationally from 2013-14. The measures to be tested by the trial areas include:

The Government has also announced that it will be creating a new role to help support outreach with vulnerable families through children’s centres. The appointed outreach system leader will act as an advocate for evidence based outreach and family support programmes.

Independent reviews conducted by Graham Allen, Frank Field and Dame Clare Tickell have all highlighted just how important pregnancy and the first five years of a child’s life are in providing children with the foundations they need to thrive and succeed in life. Evidence suggests there are five critical factors in the foundation years:

The 4Children’s website, part-funded by the government, has been developed with experts in the early years sector. Parents will be able to find information on ante-natal classes, flexible working and childcare in their area. Designed with mums and dads in mind, it is a useful reference point for parents to help them make decisions to balance their work and family lives more easily.

Anne Longfield OBE, Chief Executive of 4Children said:

Whether you are a mum or a dad, whether you have just seen the positive result on a pregnancy test or are looking for your child’s first school, this new website from early years experts is spelling out the A to Z of all your unanswered questions. Parents-to-be suddenly face a million decisions that will affect the life of their child: they find themselves having to navigate their way through a maze of conflicting facts and figures from blogs and personal websites offering advice.

Getting the information and advice you need into one easy to find place is important because it helps you to give your child the best future. Parents tell us that good information is almost as important as good housing or the community where they live, and most tell us that they don’t know where to find it. And the more information a parent has, the more they feel they are in the driving seat of their child’s future.

Professor Nutbrown said:

I am delighted to be invited to lead this review. High-quality provision for young children means that we need skilled and knowledgeable people in the workforce. I will be looking at ways in which we can strengthen qualifications and improve pathways to support career progression in the sector, to the benefit of young children, their families, and those who work in the early childhood sector. I look forward to working with the wide range of colleagues who have an interest in this crucial issue.

Public Health Minister Anne Milton said:

All the evidence indicates that the early years play a significant and formative role in shaping your health, wealth and happiness for the rest of your life. That is why we need to focus on this.

By increasing numbers of health visitors and extending the Family Nurse Partnership we want to offer the support that families need right through pregnancy and the early months and years of life.

The new national Health Visitor Taskforce will provide strong leadership and ensure the new health visiting service model is universally adopted by 2015.

I am delighted former health visitor Dame Elizabeth Fradd has agreed to chair the taskforce.

The government is not proposing to undertake payment by results directly with individual children’s centres, although we expect trial local authorities to explore this in their local areas. We are intending that payment by results is trialled at two levels:
National= DfE to local authority
Local = Local authority to individual children’s centre providers

The governmentannounced on 6 Julyplans to make the free entitlement more flexible for parents, reform to children’s centres, and a new EYFS framework.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/crackdown-on-war-memorial-theft,News story,Crackdown on war memorial theft,"Unscrupulous metal thieves who steal from war memorials will soon face tough new penalties, crime prevention minister Jeremy Browne warned today.",Home Office and Jeremy Browne,8 November 2012,"From next month powers will take effect to stop cash paid for metal and give the police stronger powers to target rogue traders.

Days before the nation marks remembrance Sunday, the minister visited a war memorial site in Erith, Kent, to learn about the devastating impact of metal thieves on the local community.

Jeremy Browne said:

‘These thieves show an utter disregard for the memory of the courageous men and women who paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country.

‘The government is determined to stamp out this illegal trade, which in recent years has cast a shadow over remembrance Sunday for bereaved families.

‘That is why we are reforming the scrap metal industry to support legitimate dealers and tighten the net around those who flout the rules.’

Last month the war memorials trust announced there has been an encouraging reduction in the number of thefts from war memorials over the past year by two thirds, but warned that there is still a worrying number taking place.

War memorial trust’s director Frances Moreton said:

‘It is always distressing when attacks on war memorials take place but particularly so at this time of year when communities gather for their remembrance services and the importance of memorials and the names on them are so poignant.

‘We are of course delighted to see that the number of theft cases reported to us has reduced significantly compared to this time last year. We are encouraged by this reduction but one theft case remains one too many so there is still a problem and we will continue to work with communities to offer advice to prevent future incidents.’

Following his visit to Erith war memorial, the minister visited a local scrap yard where he met representatives from the british transport police and European metal recycling (EMR) - one of the world’s largest metal recycling companies - to discuss what more can be done to tackle metal theft, as well as the forthcoming implementation of a new law to prohibit scrap metal dealers trading in cash.

The minister added:

‘The scrap metal dealer’s bill which, the government supports, will build on the legislative action we have already taken by allowing the closure of unlicensed premises.

‘New laws must be supported by effective enforcement. That is why I welcome the success by the police in bringing thieves to justice. We are now seeing significant reductions in metal crime across the UK.’

The scrap metal dealer’s bill was tabled by Richard Ottaway MP and is expected to receive parliamentary approval in the new year.

The bill is in addition to a dedicated £5 million provided to the metal theft taskforce and a number of recent legislative changes to tackle metal theft, which include:

Theses changes will take effect on the 3 December.

1. The home office took initial legislative measures through the legal aid, sentencing and punishment of offenders act 2012. These measures will come into effect on 3 December.

2. While it is difficult to know the exact cost of metal theft, we know there are roughly 1,000 metal thefts a week which costs the country at least £220 million each year.

3. Guidance for scrap metal dealers to implement the prohibition on cash payments is available on the home office website (see:http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/crime/scrap-metal-guidance?view=Standard&pubID=1086133). The guidance sets out which methods of payment are legal as well as providing information on what records should be kept once a payment for metal has been made.

4. The war memorials trust welcomes a fall of two thirds from 2011 to 2012 (40 thefts or attempted thefts in 2011 to 14 in 2012). This relates to only the memorials represented by this organisation. The figures do not include other heritage buildings and churches. For more information on this please see:http://www.warmemorials.org/uploads/publications/368.pdf"

‘At every stage of the process, we expect families to leave voluntarily, but while we always take a compassionate approach we must ensure that individuals with no legal right to be in the UK cannot prolong their stay and break the rules.’

The panel is one part of a new four-stage process which aims to return families with dignity, ensuring the welfare of children at all times:

•         decision-making which will be strengthened through the creation of specialist family case owners within the UK Border Agency, the development of pilots to test new ways of working with families and our continuing work with the UNHCR (the UK Refugee Agency) to test and improve the quality of our decision making.

•         assisted return, including family conferences to discuss the family’s return home, welfare and medical concerns and the availability of tailored assisted voluntary return packages to help families resettle upon their return;

•         required returns for families who fail to take up assistance packages, allowing them to remain in the community, but giving two weeks notice to board their flight home and allowing self check-in without the need for enforcement action; and

•         an ensured return, as a last resort for families who refuse to depart the UK. The new Family Returns Panel will advise the UK Border Agency on return plans to ensure the welfare of the child is taken properly into account. Options will include a form of limited notice removal, the use of open accommodation, and - as a last resort where families resolutely fail to comply- family friendly, pre-departure accommodation.

The panel will provide expert advice to the UK Border Agency on the best method of ensuring the return of individual families.Chris Spencer, the Chair of the new Family Returns Panel, said: ‘The Family Returns Panel is a welcome and vital body in ensuring the individual welfare needs of families and children during their return to their home countries.‘We welcome the opportunity to assist the government and UK Border Agency in their goal of establishing a more humane family removals policy.’The new panel has been appointed on an interim basis with an open recruitment process due to begin later in the year.The government committed to the ending of child detention for immigration purposes in December 2010."

A new short film takes viewers inside the redundant nuclear site to see how nature has adjusted to the decommissioning of Britain’s experiment with fast breeder reactors.

The five-minute film Naturally Dounreay features bird-life and mammals such as otter and stoat that have taken up residence on the 135-acre site.

It includes a 25,000 sq m area of ground that is now a wild flower meadow helping to reverse a decline in the rare great yellow bumble bee.

The film was produced for the site by freelance cameraman Chris Gregory to help raise awareness among workers of the importance of protecting the environment from harm during the site’s decommissioning.

It can be viewed at You Tube.

Simon Cottam, an environmental adviser leading the site’s biodiversity project, said: “It’s a side of Dounreay rarely seen by the outside world and one we are determined to protect and enhance as we clean up and knock down more and more of the site.”

The film includes a soundtrack featuring Melvich Gaelic Choir and Atomic Piseag."

The decision to progress with banning these drugs came after advice from the government’s independent experts on drug-related issues, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs.

If approved by Parliament, the classifications are expected to take effect in the Spring.

Minister for Crime Prevention and Antisocial Behaviour Reduction, Lord Henley, said: ‘Drugs ruin lives and cause misery in communities across the country.

Being a police and crime commissioner is a ‘big job for a big local figure’, the Prime Minister…",Home Office,25 May 2012,"See other News and speeches

Friday, 25 May 2012

Being a police and crime commissioner is a ‘big job for a big local figure’, the Prime Minister said today.

With just under six months until the vote for the country’s first police and crime commissioners (PCCs), David Cameron wrote to regional newspapers around the country saying it was a post for people from all backgrounds - not just politicians.

David Cameron said: ‘This is a big job for a big local figure. It’s a voice for the people, someone to lead the fight against crime, and someone to hold to account if they don’t deliver.

‘And with elections now just six months away, my message today is that this is the time for great candidates to come forward.’

PCCs will bring a democratic voice to people in 41 police forces across England and Wales (outside London), replacing the current system of police authorities. They will not interfere in operational decisions, but will set the direction for chief constables. PCCs will be driven by one clear aim - to use the backing they have received from the public to deliver a real, tangible difference to the lives of the people they serve by cutting crime.

Elections will take place on November 15, but the Prime Minister stressed candidates do not have to be from political parties.

He said: ‘This isn’t just for politicians, but community leaders and pioneers of all sorts. People with real experience who’ve done things and run organisations, whether they are charities or companies.

‘Whatever their background, they will need to be outstanding leaders ready to take a really big role on behalf of all of us.’"
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/consultation-begins-on-newport-passport-office-closure,News story,Consultation begins on Newport passport office closure,The Identity and Passport Service (IPS) today announced plans to enter into consultation to reduce the size of the organisation.,Home Office,8 October 2010,"Areas where current expenditure is not justified have been identified, and today’s proposal would see the passport office in Newport being closed.

This would take the number of regional passport application processing centres from five to four, and reduce staff numbers by around 300.

IPS will still have locations in Wales and continue to provide a service in Welsh, including applications in Welsh and correspondence in Welsh.

Chief executive Sarah Rapson said: ‘It is never pleasant to implement changes which means jobs are lost, but IPS is taking these steps to ensure it makes the best possible use of taxpayers’ money.

‘It is with great regret and reluctance that we are consulting on closing our Newport office. But by improving efficiency in the passport application processing network, IPS can be smaller and still deliver good customer service and a secure, internationally respected passport without additional funding from the taxpayer.’

A detailed internal review of its resources has shown that IPS currently has too much capacity which could only be resolved by closing a processing centre.

Analysis found that closing the Newport office would result in the greatest reduction of spare capacity at the lowest cost to the taxpayer.

The proposal will now be the subject of formal consultation with unions.

IPS will do everything it can to avoid compulsory redundancies and is working with the Wales Office to try to minimise the impact on the region."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dounreay-modifies-beach-monitoring-system,News story,Dounreay modifies beach monitoring system,Dounreay has modified the equipment used to detect radioactive particles on beaches near the site.,Dounreay,13 June 2013,"The modification was made following the discovery of a particle last year with an unusual radiation signal. It makes the system more sensitive to the detection of other such particles, without affecting its ability to detect the usual type of particle that has been found near Dounreay.

The modified system is now being used routinely on beaches near the site.

The unusual particle was detected in February 2012 during routine beach monitoring. Laboratory analysis showed it was dominated by beta radiation rather than the gamma radiation normally associated with particle finds. Beta radiation is less penetrative than gamma radiation.

Following discussion with independent experts, regulators and beaches monitoring contractor Nuvia, the plastic covering that protects the detection sensors was replaced with a carbon fibre covering.

Carbon fibre is less dense than plastic, improving the capability of the equipment to detect other such particles that may be present.

DSRL is continuing to monitor beaches to a programme regulated by SEPA. DSRL has applied for a new Authorisation under the Radioactive Substances Act, under which the beaches monitoring programme may change.

In its assessment issued as part of the Authorisation consultation process, SEPA concluded that that the continued monitoring of some beaches may not be warranted and that for others the frequency of monitoring could be reduced. In its response to the consultation, DSRL requested that SEPA consider maintaining the existing schedule and frequency of monitoring for the time being at the beach where the unusual particle was found and the Dounreay foreshore.

The Particles Retrieval Advisory Group, a body of independent experts set up to advise SEPA and DSRL, are assessing the results of all on-shore and off-shore monitoring and retrieval operations and are expected to publish their final report soon."

Local contractor J Gunn & Sons has been awarded the contract for the site enabling works; a four month contract with work that commenced at the end of October.

Street Cranes Special Projects Ltd has been awarded the contract to design the drum handling crane.

The Highland Council granted planning permission in March for an extension to the Dounreay Cementation Plant.
The facility uses a remotely-operated process to condition and immobilise higher activity liquid waste for long term storage by mixing it with cement in steel drums.

The extension will provide more storage space for 500 litre waste drums and a drum inspection area.

The total cost to construct the extension is around £22 million, with construction expected to be complete by early 2018."

The project provides a range of technical and business support services, workshops and events to Scottish companies who are in, or have the potential to enter the nuclear supply chain.

The three year programme is funded by Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, and is managed by TWI and delivered in partnership with National Nuclear Laboratory, Optimat Ltd and Silver Stream Business Services.

Speaking at the event, Ken Linn outlined the commercial opportunities for the Dounreay site including the work carried out to identify how small and medium sized businesses can contribute socio economic benefits to the area, such as providing traineeships or apprentice places and how socio economic benefit can be built into the contract to assist the local community.

The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) is keen to encourage its sites to ensure that small businesses have the opportunity to bid for work and be successful. Anna MacConnell, NDA stakeholder relations and socio economics manager said “Across the NDA estate we encourage the sites to look at innovative ways of involving the smaller businesses

“Small companies become even more important in a community like ours where we need as much as possible of the profits from decommissioning to stay in the area. This is why we have encouraged DSRL to put more focus on helping small businesses get a bigger share of the work. Primarily, through the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, the DSRL commercial team are finding ways of making local companies aware of the opportunities that exist which in turn helps our community.”

Head of Procurement, Ken Linn said

The event was very well attended and it is pleasing to see there are a number of companies looking to break into the nuclear decommissioning arena.

Events like these help to communicate the site’s procurement requirements and ensures we can have a robust competitive review before awarding contracts.

Socio Economics is an important part of our work and we are keen to make sure that we can maximise local benefits within the boundaries of the contracting legislation.

Dounreay has placed £9M worth of business with 98 local small and medium-sized companies in the last financial year."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/temporary-bans-to-fight-back-against-legal-highs,Press release,Temporary bans to fight back against 'legal highs',"Swifter action to tackle new 'legal highs' through temporary bans was promised today by James Brokenshire, minister for crime prevention.",Home Office and The Rt Hon James Brokenshire,19 August 2010,"For the first time the government will be able to react quickly as new substances emerge with temporary 12 month bans. The bans will send a clear message to users that these substances carry a risk and will prevent new chemicals becoming widely available.

The government will introduce new legislation which will enable police to confiscate suspected substances and the UK Border Agency will seize shipments entering the country. The penalty for supply will be a maximum of 14 years in prison and an unlimited fine. Possession of a temporarily banned substance for personal use would not be a criminal offence to prevent the unnecessary criminalisation of young people.

Minister for crime prevention James Brokenshire said: ‘The drugs market is changing and we need to adapt current laws to allow us to act more quickly.

‘The temporary ban allows us to act straight away to stop new substances gaining a foothold in the market and help us tackle unscrupulous drug dealers trying to get round the law by peddling dangerous chemicals to young people.

‘However, anyone tempted to try a legal high must understand it is not safe or sensible to take a substance when you do not know what it is or what is in it - especially when some are claimed to be pond cleaner or bath salts.’

Substances would be temporarily banned following initial consideration by the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD). The ACMD will then conduct a comprehensive review of the harms of the substance and advise whether it should be permanently banned.

‘Legal highs’ including naphyrone, mephedrone, GBL and synthetic cannabinoids have already been banned, but this new system of temporary bans will allow for a faster response.

There is clear evidence substances advertised as new drugs - including Ivory Wave - often contain drugs, like mephedrone, which are already banned and known to be harmful.  The temporary bans will apply to new chemical substances that have not previously been banned.

Today the government has also published a consultation on the new drug strategy, which sets out the key themes of the government’s vision for drugs policy - which includes preventing drug taking, disrupting drug supply, strengthening enforcement, and promoting drug treatment and recovery. The targeted consultation is an opportunity for drug experts, charities and law enforcement agencies to help inform the new drug strategy, which will be launched before the end of the year.

The government set out in the coalition document:

We will introduce a system of temporary bans on new ‘legal highs’ while health issues are considered by independent experts. We will not permanently ban a substance without receiving full advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs.

Substances in the temporary class will be illegal to produce or supply under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

The offences listed for any substances added to the temporary class will include possession with intent to supply, offer to supply, supply, importation, exportation and production.

Subject to parliamentary approval the system of temporary bans will be introduced by the end of next year.

TheWomen Count: Charity leaders 2012report is the first of its kind and shows women are thriving in the voluntary sector.

Home Secretary and Minister for Women and Equalities Theresa May said: ‘I am delighted to see so many talented women running our charities. While this first report is encouraging, more still needs to be done to help women reach the top and unleash their full economic potential.

‘This index is an important step. I hope it inspires even more progress in the voluntary sector and encourages corporate firms to follow suit and draw on this impressive pool of talent.’

The index shows almost a third of directors of the UK’s top 100 charities by income are female - double the 15.8% of women on the boards of FTSE 100 firms.

But men still lead the vast majority of charities and the report calls for further action to improve their gender balance.

The Home Secretary launched the first annual index while speaking at an event hosted by investment bank Nomura to encourage more women into leadership roles.

It follows work to boost the number of women on boards in the private sector, which is measured every year by the Cranfield Female FTSE report.

The new index draws attention to the large pool of female talent in the voluntary sector and backs Lord Davies’ recommendation that corporate firms look to  these women to balance their boards."

DSRL’s heritage officer, James Gunn, said: “The table was commissioned for the official opening ceremony of PFR in June 1966, where the first turf was cut in front of the old farm cottages that have since been demolished.
“Preserving our industrial heritage for future generations to enjoy is a crucial part of our decommissioning programme.”

Anna MacConnell, NDA’s stakeholder relations and socio economic manager, said: “The PFR carved stone symbolises the pioneering nature of the work done at Dounreay and its important part in the history of the nuclear industry worldwide.

“It also marks an important chapter in the history of Caithness.  It is fitting that the carving will stay in the county and be given pride of place at the entrance to Nucleus, the NDA and Caithness Archives.”

Instead, this government is concentrating its efforts on developing intelligent, light-touch, common sense policies that have a demonstrable impact on people’s lives.

Equalities Minister Lynne Featherstone said:

‘Effective equalities policy works with the grain of human nature, not against it. That’s why we abandoned the last government’s approach of simply trying to dictate how people should behave.

‘Instead, we’re putting in place an architecture to support businesses, organisations and individuals to do the right thing. This one-year-on evaluation shows that the new approach is already paying off.’

The government’s equality strategy, ‘building a fairer Britain’, was launched in December 2010. It focuses on delivering equality through reducing red tape, increasing transparency and supporting local action. Some of the positive measures introduced since the strategy was first published include:

1. ’The equality strategy - building a fairer Britain: progress report’ is available online.http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/equalities/equality-strategy-publications/progress-report

Previously, section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 allowed officers to search individuals even if they didn’t have reasonable suspicion that the person was involved in terrorist activity.

But the coalition government looked again at this power as part of a wide rangingreview of counter-terror laws.

That review concluded that some form of stop and search without reasonable suspicion was needed, but that it should only take place in exceptional circumstances.

The stop and search powers contained within today’s order are included in theProtection of Freedoms Billand will be scrutinised as that progresses through parliament.

New 6 month notice periods to be in place until at least 31 March 2021

Once eviction hearings restart, the judiciary will carefully prioritise the most serious cases including those involving anti-social behaviour and domestic abuse

Renters affected by coronavirus will continue to be protected after the government extended the ban on evictions for another 4 weeks, meaning in total no legal evictions will have taken place for 6 months, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has announced today (21 August 2020).

The government also intends to give tenants greater protection from eviction over the winter by requiring landlords to provide tenants with 6 months’ notice in all bar those cases raising other serious issues such as those involving anti-social behaviour and domestic abuse perpetrators, until at least the end of March.

The government will keep these measures under review with decisions guided by the latest public health advice.

When courts do resume eviction hearings they will carefully prioritise the most egregious cases, ensuring landlords are able to progress the most serious cases, such as those involving anti-social behaviour and other crimes, as well as where landlords have not received rent for over a year and would otherwise face unmanageable debts.

The government has taken unprecedented action to support renters during the pandemic, preventing people getting into financial hardship and helping businesses to pay salaries – meaning no tenants have been evicted since the start.

As a result, according to independent research, 87% of tenants have continued to pay full rent since the start of the pandemic, with a further 8% agreeing reduced fees with their landlords.

The vast majority of landlords have shown understanding and leadership, taking action to support tenants.

With coronavirus still posing an ongoing risk to public health, the government will continue to take action where necessary to further protect households in both the private and social rented sector are supported over winter, helping to keep them safe.

Today’s extension to the stay and 6 month notice periods will ensure those most at risk are protected. If tenants are unable to afford their rent we encourage them to speak to their landlord to agree a solution, and some households may decide to consider moving.

Government will continue to work with the judiciary and stakeholders to ensure that the courts are prepared for eviction cases to be heard safely.

Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick MP said:

I know this year has been challenging and all of us are still living with the effects of COVID-19. That is why today I am announcing a further 4 week ban on evictions, meaning no renters will have been evicted for 6 months.

I am also increasing protections for renters – 6 month notice periods must be given to tenants, supporting renters over winter.

However, it is right that the most egregious cases, for example those involving anti-social behaviour or domestic abuse perpetrators, begin to be heard in court again; and so when courts reopen, landlords will once again be able to progress these priority cases.

Case listing, including prioritisation, is a judicial function and we are working with the judiciary through the Master of the Rolls’ Working Group on possession to consider the categories of serious cases that would be prioritised when hearings resume. Further detail on those categories will be set out in due course and we will engage with key stakeholders on this.

Independent polling for the National Residential Landlords Associationrecently found that 87% of private tenants have paid their rent as normal throughout the pandemic so far. An additional 8% said that they had agreed a reduced rent, a rent-free period or made some other agreement with their landlord or letting agent.

The extension to the ban on evictions and prioritisation of the most serious case applies to courts in England and Wales

The intention to extend notice periods to 6 month applies to England only.

On 5 June the government announced that the suspension of housing possession cases in the courts had been extended by a further 2 months.

To support those on Universal Credit or Housing Benefit in the private rented sector, Local Housing Allowance rates have been set to the 30th percentile of rents in each area. For those who require additional support Discretionary Housing Payments are available.

As announced at the spending round for 2020/21 there is already £180 million in Discretionary Housing Payments for Local authorities to distribute for supporting renters with housing costs in the private and social rented sectors.

We remain committed to bringing forward reforms to provide greater security to tenants, but it is only right that this is balanced with an assurance that landlords are able to recover their properties where they have valid reasons to do so. This is vital to ensuring the future supply of good quality housing in the rented sector.

We will bring forward legislation in due course, once the urgencies of responding to the pandemic have passed, to deliver a better deal for renters and a fairer more effective rental market.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/biggest-overhaul-to-child-performance-regulations-in-over-40-years,Press release,Biggest overhaul to child performance regulations in over 40 years,"Outdated and confusing child performance rules are to be overhauled, under sweeping changes published today by Children’s Minister Tim Loughton.",Department for Education and Tim Loughton,24 May 2012,"Outdated and confusing child performance rules are to be overhauled, under sweeping changes published today by Children’s Minister Tim Loughton.

The requirements for licensing under-16s to take part safely in public performances - including television, radio, films or stage - have not been reformed since 1968.

But there is widespread concern they are now simply archaic, complex, irrelevant and overly bureaucratic - drawn up in an age with just three television channels and a handful of radio stations; predating the creation of Ofcom; and taking no account of tighter child protection legislation over the last four decades.

The current rules mean that:

Today’s proposed changes, welcomed by award-winning actor and patron of the Little Theatre Guild, Sir Ian McKellen, will:

For television and radio, the proposals are that a licence will be required when children are placed in “artificial situations”, which “have been contrived for artistic, editorial or dramatic effect”. Programmes which may be billed or presented as ‘observational’ or ‘factual’, but where the experience of the child is still contrived for dramatic effect, will also require licensing. ‘Unmanipulated’ interviews with children or films showing them in the ordinary course of their lives will not need licensing.

The final decision will rest with the local authority.

The exact judgement varies from programme to programme - it will be down to local authorities to work with producers on where to draw the line.

The full list of activities exempt and not exempt for licensing are in the notes to editors.

With or without a performance licence, all UK broadcasters already have to abide by Ofcom’s tough Broadcasting Code to protect under-18s in radio and TV programmes. Ofcom investigates complaints post-transmission about potential breaches of the Code and has powers to impose tough sanctions.

Today’s proposals will be publicly consulted on for nine weeks.

They follow a review of the existing regulations by former chair of the Royal Television Society and former advisor to Ofcom, Sarah Thane CBE, which reported to the last government in March 2010.

There have been detailed preparatory talks in recent months, with broadcasters, theatre producers, dance companies, amateur dramatic societies, local authorities, children’s charities, modelling agencies - with there being widespread backing for change.

Children’s Minister Tim Loughton said:

We want to nurture not just the big stars of the future but help all children realise their talents by being able to perform. Everyone should have the chance to act, sing, dance and play sport - giving them memories for life.

The current rules get in the way of that. They are outdated, complex, confusing and not fit for purpose. They come from an age when there were just three television channels and bear no relation to the broadcasting or performing industries in the 21st century. The rules are incredibly complex, bureaucratic and patchily applied - meaning that many amateur dramatic groups simply do not involve children in their plans, which is ridiculous.

There is widespread demand for reform and backing for our approach. Child protection must always be paramount but reams of paperwork do not keep anyone safe - responsible adults do.  The new system will require producers to consider all the risks to children from the outset and make robust arrangements to keep them from harm. Children’s safety cannot be an afterthought or a box-ticking exercise.

Cutting back unnecessary red tape will free local authorities to focus on helping producers to develop effective safeguarding policies, and to inspect and enforce the requirements.

Sir Ian McKellen, patron of the Little Theatre Guild said:

I am relieved that amateur drama groups will now face far less bureaucracy before being able to engage children in their productions. The Little Theatre Guild has proposed a chaperone system that removes the need for licensed chaperones that will continue to allow Guild theatres to encourage young people in their discovery of live theatre.

Sarah Thane CBE, former chair of the Royal Television Society and former advisor to Ofcom said:

Reform of the system is overdue and badly needed. This consultation is a key step towards a modern system which increases opportunities for children to perform by reducing bureaucracy and re-focusing responsibility for their well-being. I welcome the government’s overall approach and urge all the relevant stakeholders to take part and ensure that the new regime is fair, and both user- and child-friendly.

Jonathan Rallings, Barnardo’s Assistant Director of Policy, said:

The government’s proposed review of legislation to protect child performers is timely. The law was last changed over forty years ago - back in the analogue age - and needs updating for our digital world. We fully hope that any new legislation will strike a balance between safeguarding children whilst allowing them to take part in the opportunities that the creative industries can offer.

John McVay, Chief Executive of the Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television (Pact), said:

Pact applauds the coalition government for acting to update outmoded and outdated legislation that has led to a postcode lottery for children, parents and producers for too long. Contrary to some extreme views all UK children wherever they live should be able to realise their talents and possibly careers in broadcasting by being able to participate in a wide range of programmes - from documentaries to talent shows - while making sure that the welfare of the child is central to their involvement.

UK broadcasters and the producers they commission are already subject to rigorous Ofcom broadcasting codes and this new legislation will build on these regulations while making sure that local authorities concentrate on inspection and not interfere unnecessarily in editorial issues. Pact is committed to working with government to ensure that this is legislation is fit for licensing children living in the 21st century.

Pact is the trade association for feature film, television, digital, children’s and animation media companies.

The proposals will apply to England and Wales.

The consultation will be published on theDepartment for Education’s website’

The key proposals published for consultation will:

A. Make clear when a licence is required for a child to take part in a professional performance.

The following activities will require local authority licences. In addition, television and radio producers must abide by the Ofcom’s robust Broadcasting Code, which covers all under-18s appearing in television and radio broadcasts who are:

The following will be exempt:

The consultation asks on whether the first four days a child performs in any six month period should be exempt, if the child is not paid.

The proposals will lift age specific limitations on children doing certain types of activities. The current legislation places restrictions on issuing licences to children under-14 unless they are for singing, dancing, acting or taking part in a musical performance.

B) Streamline the licensing process for children to take part in professional productions.

The current rules deter many producers from involving children at all and tie local authority licensing officers up in red tape and paperwork, rather than inspections and enforcement.

The proposals will:

Sarah Thane CBE published herExploratory Review of the Regulation of Child Performancein March 2010.

The report set out proposals to reform and rebalance the system for licensing child performance, including the rules around working hours, medicals, education, children under 14, and proposals about the inspection arrangements.

The main recommendations were:

In December 2010, the coalition governmentset up a working group to develop the Thane  recommendations.

The working group included:

The independent broadcast regulator Ofcom was created under the Communications Act 2003. There are two rules in the Ofcom Broadcasting Code which apply to the participation of those aged under eighteen in television and radio programmes:

Engineering consultancies, film makers and soil remediation experts are among the variety of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with different skills and capabilities that have signalled their interest in supporting 1 of Europe’s most complex decommissioning programmes by signing up to LINC – liaise, innovate, network and collaborate – with Dounreay.

Two of those registered were among 5 companies that recently took part in a workshop to assess options for size-reducing components in the Prototype Fast Reactor. IKM Consulting and AJ Engineering were given the opportunity to contribute ideas and work alongside existing suppliers in the first project launched as part of the scheme.

Stephen Adamson, Head of Commercial Services, said:

This felt like the perfect way to launch as SMEs collaborated with existing supply chain companies to develop solutions. I am delighted that 1 of the companies had never worked with us before and even more impressed that 80% of the 100 companies to register have the potential to support us for the first time.

John Harper, Reactors Principal Engineer, added:

There is a great deal of expertise within these smaller organisations that we need to tap into. It was very beneficial to have Alan and Graeme with us at the workshop and to get their views and opinions on this complex project.

Many of these companies haven’t worked in the nuclear industry before, but there is no doubt that their expertise will benefit our decommissioning programme.

A recent event in Aberdeen, organised by the Energy Industries Council, added more companies from the oil and gas industry to the pool of talent registered while Sellafield has now launched its own version of LINC, increasing opportunities for collaboration between the 2 sites and their supply chain companies.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-armour-to-stop-age-discrimination-in-the-nhs,News story,New armour to stop age discrimination in the NHS,"Dignity and respect will be firmly at the centre of every NHS and social care service from October, as a ban on age discrimination comes into effect, the government announced today.",Home Office and The Rt Hon Theresa May,12 June 2012,"The move follows a public consultation led by the home office which looked at how age affects the way people are treated in every aspect of public and private service provision.

In the past, the needs of older people have sometimes been ignored and they have been treated without the dignity and respect they deserve. Many of the solutions lie with the local NHS, social care providers and others. But government has a part to play too - and is fulfilling its promise to implement the age discrimination ban with no exceptions in health and social care. This means that all people, regardless of age, will receive a personal, fair and diverse service, based on their individual needs, not their age.

Home secretary and minister for women and equalities Theresa May said:

‘We want to make sure everyone can realise their potential; part of this means ensuring people are treated fairly regardless of their age. Having consulted widely and considered the evidence carefully, we have found that there are some areas where older people are at particular risk of unfair treatment. So we are acting to put that right.

‘This legislation will be targeted, fair and proportionate. The vast majority of businesses and organisations will be able to continue to operate as usual and certain areas will be exempt from the ban altogether. We are confident that the action we are taking strikes the right balance between business and consumers’ interests.’

Care services minister Paul Burstow said:

‘We know that older people are not always treated with the dignity and respect they deserve because of ageist attitudes - this will not be tolerated. There is no place for age discrimination in the NHS or social care.

‘Our population is ageing as more of us live longer.  The challenge for the NHS is to look beyond a person’s date of birth and meet the needs of older people as individuals.’

Age discrimination in the workplace is already unlawful, but until now there has been no equivalent legal requirement on public and private services. This has led to inconsistent practices and unfair treatment, with the needs of older people in particular being ignored.

There will be specific exceptions from the new law, for example insurance companies will still be able to use age when assessing risk and deciding prices and travel operators will be able to offer free bus travel for over-60s. The exceptions provide clarity for private and public sector organisations - and their customers - over exactly where the line should be drawn.

The provisions in the equality act 2010 will take effect in October 2012, but the government has been clear that legislation is not the only answer to tackling discrimination. This can be seen in the voluntary agreement reached with the insurance industry in April this year to make it easier for older people to get motor and travel insurance and provide greater transparency on how decisions are made.

Today’s announcement will prevent unjustifiable discrimination, while also making common sense exceptions to allow business to operate as usual. It will protect young adults as well as the old.

Examples of the type of harmful discrimination the ban aims to end include:

Paul Burstow went on to say:

‘I have heard numerous stories from people who feel that they have been discriminated against.  One 84-year-old lady told how her doctor had been treating her for angina for years. Two years ago, she had an appointment to have an operation on a bunion on her big toe. However, because of the angina they sent her for a heart scan.

‘They found that it was not angina, but actually a leaky valve. She asked if she could have this fixed and the doctors said “What are you bothered about, at your age?”. I am pleased to say she stuck to her guns and said she wanted the job done. At long last, she has managed to get an appointment but the whole experience made her feel pushed aside.

‘This is exactly the kind of discrimination we want to rule out in the NHS.’

However while there are cases of discrimination there are also many other examples where staff in the NHS and social care are making a real difference to peoples’ experiences. For example the central and North West London NHS foundation trust who are redefining their older adults metal health services to make sure that age is not a factor for access.

The government is clear that age discrimination has no place in society and more importantly in the NHS and care services.

‘Effective prevention and help can only happen when all the agencies involved work together to common goals and a common understanding. It is also vital that victims themselves are clear what constitutes abuse so they seek help early and unnecessary suffering can be avoided by adults and children alike.’

Coercive control is a complex pattern of abuse using power and psychological control over another - financial control, verbal abuse, forced social isolation.  These incidents may vary in seriousness and be repeated over time.  It is widely recognised that domestic violence is often underpinned by a pattern of such behaviour.

The guidance follows the environmental sustainability advice the CMA provided to the UK government in March 2022.  As part of that work, the CMA found businesses wanted more clarity about what is, and what is not, legal when working together towards environmental sustainability goals. The CMA publicly consulted on a draft of this guidance earlier this year, and this final version reflects the useful comments received from a wide range of interested people and businesses.

This is part of a wider awareness campaign which the CMA has launched today which includes a video and a roadmap. The roadmap focuses on different categories of risk to help businesses navigate what they need to consider as a first step before reading the full CMA guidance document or seeking legal advice.

Example: The fashion sector agrees to set targets for gradually increasing the amount of sustainable materials used in their clothing ranges. The CMA’s guidance explains how this should be done so these businesses can be confident their agreement complies with competition law.

For companies which are in doubt, the CMA is operating an open-door policy where businesses (and representative bodies such as trade associations), non-governmental organisations and charities can approach the CMA for informal guidance on proposed environmental sustainability initiatives. You can read more about the CMA open-door policyhere.

Sarah Cardell, CMA Chief Executive, said:

We know that tackling climate change and promoting environmental sustainability matters, and supporting businesses to do this is a priority for the CMA. So, we have developed the Green Agreements Guidance for all companies who are considering collaborating so they can understand how to agree green goals without breaking the law.

The guidance goes further than before - it gives firms greater certainty about when agreements that genuinely contribute to addressing climate change will be exempt from competition law. Our open-door policy means we can work with companies to give them tailored informal guidance on how they can work together to boost the green economy.

TheGreen Agreements Guidancepublished today is part of a wider range of documents on agreements between businesses at the same level of the supply chain (so-called ‘horizontal agreements’). This follows work from the CMA’s Sustainability Taskforce after it published itsenvironmental sustainability adviceto the UK government in March 2022."

Likely harms include adverse effects on the heart and blood vessels, hyperthermia, dependence and psychiatric effects.

Read the full press release here.

Minister for crime prevention James Brokenshire said: ‘I am deeply concerned about the use of this potentially dangerous “legal high” and I want to make it illegal as soon as possible.‘We have already taken action to ban its import into the UK and we will continue to target those unscrupulous dealers who try to bring these substances onto our streets.‘I also want to send a clear message to anyone considering buying a “legal high” - just because they are advertised as “legal” does not mean that they are safe and they may not be legal. You are putting your health at risk and could be committing a criminal offence.’

Today the government laid a parliamentary order, and legislation will follow at the earliest opportunity. This will include a generic definition to prevent drug manufacturers tweaking the chemical structure in an attempt to get around the law.

Meanwhile, the UK Border Agency (UKBA) is now able to seize and destroy these substances at the border. Following a similar ban on mephedrone and related compounds in March 2010 UKBA has already prevented more than 115kg of suspected mephedrone reaching UK streets."

It will take Dounreay’s decommissioning into a new phase, when historic wastes from the shaft, silo and low level waste pits are due to be retrieved, repackaged and consigned to modern waste facilities.

Stephen Adamson, Head of Commercial Services, said: “This framework will deliver real and visible signs of decommissioning progress. It is about forming long-term partnerships so that the successful companies can work alongside our own Dounreay staff, ensuring a first-class team combining the best site skills and experience with the wider industry knowledge and innovation that the supply chain can offer.

“We hope to see larger national companies forming relationships with the local supply chain to deliver packages of work. We want to drive efficiencies and innovation as well as create the opportunity for new skills and development, which will help to sustain the local supply chain and economy. All bids will need to include proposed socio-economic plans which will set out how companies can help us create a positive legacy in 
Caithness and north Sutherland in preparation for completion of the site’s decommissioning.”

Publication of the contract notice follows an industry day earlier this year which was attended by more than 100 interested parties. Companies are now invited to express their interest, with contracts expected to be awarded during the second half of 2018.

Once the UK’s centre of fast reactor research, Dounreay is now Scotland’s largest nuclear decommissioning project and is widely recognised as Europe’s most complex nuclear closure programme. The work is being delivered by Dounreay Site Restoration Limited, a company owned by Cavendish Dounreay Partnership, on behalf of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority."

After more than 3 decades of service, Pacers are being phased out alongside the introduction of a fleet of entirely new and refurbished trains across the northern network, delivering more modern and frequent services with extra seats for passengers in the north.

This summer, rail industry partners will launch a competition offering community groups the opportunity to put forward their plans to convert a Pacer into a new public space.

The Pacer will be donated by rolling stock company Porterbrook.

For further information or to get involved in the competition, please emailcommunityrailcompetition@dft.gov.uk.

Rail Minister Andrew Jones said:

The Pacers have been the workhorses of the north’s rail network, connecting communities for more than 30 years, but it is clear that they have outstayed their welcome.

That is why they are being phased out completely to make way for new or fully-refurbished trains, improving journeys and creating space for 40,000 more passengers

Through this competition we can ensure that the Pacer can be transformed to serve a community near where it carried passengers in an entirely different way. What we need now are creative and exciting proposals from the public, alongside ideas from businesses keen to support this competition, as we say goodbye to Pacers on our railway.

Northern Powerhouse Minister Jake BerryMPsaid:

Making the north one of the best connected regions in the UK is at the heart of our ambition for a thrivingNorthern Powerhouse. Replacing Pacers with a brand new fleet of trains is not just great news for passengers, it now provides this exciting opportunity for our grassroots community groups across the north to bring people together through this competition.

I travelled to school on a Pacer train and I look forward to getting on board again to see how these old carriages will continue to provide a valuable service for many years to come.

Senior sponsor at Network Rail, Andrew Morgan, said:

As part of the Great North Rail Project, we have lengthened platforms, remodelled track and altered Victorian structures across the north. These upgrades have paved the way for new and refurbished longer trains, allowing the pacer train to be phased out.

Managing Director of Arriva Rail North, David Brown, said:

Northern is introducing 101 new trains worth £500 million, the first of these new trains will be carrying customers this summer, and at the same time we will start to retire the Pacer trains. Using a Pacer as a valued community space is a very fitting way to commemorate the service they have provided since they entered service a generation ago.

More than 100 new trains will be rolled out by Northern and TransPennine Express from this year, offering more comfortable seats and improved accessibility.

It comes as part as part of a significant investment by both government, Network Rail and train operators as part of the Great North Rail Project to transform the national rail network, delivering more than 4,500 new carriages to UK passengers.

Making the north one of the best-connected regions in the UK is at the heart of the government’s ambition for a thriving Northern Powerhouse.

Department for Transport is investing £13 billion through to 2020 to transform transport across the region and is focussed on supercharging transport connections for years through our support forHS2and Northern Powerhouse Rail.

Between 2019 and 2024, the government will also invest around £3 billion further in upgrading the Transpennine route between Manchester, Leeds and York to deliver faster, more frequent and more reliable journeys with more seats.

On Sunday 19 May (2019) the rail industry launched a new timetable that has seen around 1,000 extra services a week added across the country.

The campaign will ensure we are all ready to seize the opportunities available for the first time in nearly fifty years as a fully sovereign United Kingdom.

Business and citizens may need to take action regardless of the type of agreement reached with the EU.

Today the government is launching a major new public information campaign, ‘The UK’s new start: let’s get going’. It will clearly set out the actions businesses and individuals need to take to prepare for the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, and ensure they are ready to seize the opportunities that it will bring. Campaign advertisements will include our “Check, Change, Go” strapline which directs people and businesses to a straightforward checker tool atgov.uk/transitionwhich quickly identifies the necessary next steps they need to take.

The campaign will run across the full range of communication channels, including TV advertising and radio, out of home, digital, print, and direct channels such as text messages and Webinars.  The campaign will also see the launch of a field force team which will give one-to-one support in person or over the phone to businesses and their supply chains to minimise disruption to the movement of goods.

The campaign will target UK citizens intending to travel to Europe from 1 January 2021 and all importers to and exporters from the EU, alongside UK nationals living in the EU and EU, EEA or Swiss citizens living in the UK.

The actions people and business owners need to take vary based on their circumstances. They include:

Making sure you are ready to travel to Europe from 1 January 2021, for example by getting comprehensive travel insurance, ensuring your passport is valid, and checking your roaming policy with your mobile phone provider.

If you want to travel to Europe with your pet from 1 January 2021, contact your vet at least 4 months before you travel.

Making sure your business is ready to export or import from/to the EU, for example by getting an EU EORI number or registering with the relevant Customs Authority.

The campaign isn’t being run just to prepare people and businesses for changes at the end of the year. It will also highlight the significant opportunities ahead including for exporters through new free trade agreements, for small businesses through smarter regulation, and for fishermen as we take back control of our coastal waters.

This campaign will run alongside the UK’s continued negotiations with the EU. The UK is leaving the single market and customs union at the end of the year, and so most of the actions businesses and citizens are being asked to take will need to be completed regardless of the outcome of negotiations.

Some areas of UK-wide guidance published will not be applicable for trade between Northern Ireland and the European Union, until negotiations have concluded with the EU. Initial guidance specific to Northern Ireland will be published in the coming weeks and will continue to be issued throughout the transition period. The government is already working closely with NI businesses, traders, agents, carriers and ports to prepare for the end of the transition period.

Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said:

At the end of this year we are leaving the single market and Customs Union regardless of the type of agreement we reach with the EU. This will bring changes and significant opportunities for which we all need to prepare.

While we have already made great progress in getting ready for this moment, there are actions that businesses and citizens must take now to ensure we are ready to hit the ground running as a fully independent United Kingdom.

This is a new start for everyone in the UK - British and European citizens alike - so let’s get going.

Today’s consultation looks at how this will work in practice. Give us your response by visiting theGovernment Equalities Office website.

Lynne Featherstone said: ‘The government is committed to both advancing equality for lesbian, gay and bisexual people and ensuring freedom of religion for people of all faiths.’

She added: ‘No religious group will be forced to host a civil partnership registration, but for those who wish to do so this is an important step forward.’

The consultation document sets out proposals for a two-stage process. It would see faith groups first agreeing whether to allow civil partnership registrations on their premises.

Following this agreement, individual religious premises could then apply to their local authority for  to host these registrations.

This would work in a similar way to the existing process for non-religious venues such as hotels which are asking for approval to host civil marriages and partnership registrations.

The consultation will run until 23 June.

To control those coming here, the government has committed to:

The government was determined to make changes to tier one - the ‘highly skilled’ tier -  when it was revealed that approximately a third of those coming through this route were actually doing low skilled jobs once they were in the UK. Businesses have made it clear that their priority is to fill their specific vacancies through tier two.

Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘Today’s announcement has set out a clear, rational approach to which workers we will allow into the UK job market. We have set out an approach which will not only get immigration down to sustainable levels but at the same time, protects those businesses and institutions which are vital to our economy.‘We will take action on all routes into the UK and these changes are crucial if we are to limit the numbers coming here to work, while still attracting the brightest and the best to the UK.‘We have worked closely with businesses while designing this system, and listened to their feedback, but we have also made clear that as the recovery continues, we need employers to look first to people who are out of work and who are already in this country.’The new rules will take affect from April 2011. Applicants under tier two will still be required to apply for a visa from the UK Border Agency through the PBS, will have to be of graduate level, be sponsored by an employer and will be awarded points based on scarcity of skills and salary.

However they will be competing against other applicants for a visa to enter the UK and in months when the limit is oversubscribed those with the most points will qualify for one of the certificates of sponsorship available each month.

Separately, businesses can bring in their own employees through the intra-company transfer route but they must be earning more than £40,000 to stay more than 12 months, and their stay will be restricted to five years.

The coalition government has vowed to reduce net migration, to achieve this goal changes are being made across the immigration system - with the tightening of the economic routes just one part of a package of measures.

In line with that commitment, a consultation will be launched before the end of the year focusing on tier four of the PBS -  the student route -  which currently accounts for two thirds of migrants entering the UK each year. By introducing a system that is more selective and more robust, the Government is aiming to stamp out abuse while continuing to attract the top students to our top universities.

The consultation, which will run for eight weeks, will seek views on a range of measures to reduce the number of students that can come into the UK including:

Theresa May added: ‘I want to ensure that students and education providers are of a high quality.

‘People imagine students to be those who come here for a few years to study at university and then go home - that is not always the case. We estimate that nearly half of all students coming here from abroad are coming to study a course below degree level where levels of compliance with immigration requirements are not high enough.

‘While we will protect our world class universities, we want suitably qualified students with the genuine desire to study to come to our country. We must also have a more robust system to ensure that students leave the country at the end of their legitimate stay.’"

Speaking at the event, she said:

‘This government’s first priority is to get our economy back in shape. Creating opportunities for women to achieve their full potential is at the heart of our approach.

‘We have announced a new mentoring scheme for those who want to start or grow their own business. We are introducing flexible parental leave and extending the right to request flexible working, as well as increasing women’s representation at senior levels and taking action to help close the gender pay gap.

‘The government will also establish a Women’s Business Council, to advise on what more we can do to maximise women’s contribution to future economic growth.’

A recent study by the Government Equalities Office estimated that better use of women’s skills could deliver economic benefits of fifteen to twenty one billion pounds per year. Tackling inequality is not just crucial for women but crucial for our economy."

Eight people were arrested after a fake visa discovered by aUK Border Agencyofficer in the capital Dhaka was traced back to the forgers’ base in the city of Sylhet in north east Bangladesh.

Following the detection of the forged visa by an entry clearance officer, the agency’s RALON (risk and liaison overseas network) team in Dhaka worked with the US Embassy in Bangladesh and Bangladeshi police to trace the forgery back to the factory.

Bangladeshi immigration special branch officers then moved in on the alleged forgers. The police investigation is ongoing.

‘We have made our border safer as a result of this operation,’ said regional director, Chris Dix.

‘We will not tolerate abuse of the UK’s immigration controls and this operation shows what we can achieve through close and effective co-operation with the Bangladesh authorities and other countries to target this kind of fraud.

‘The UK Border Agency has effective verification systems as part of the UK visa application process. Where it uncovers fraud and forgery, the UK Border Agency will refuse an application, ban the applicant from travel to the UK for 10 years and will refer applicants and agents to the Bangladeshi police.’

Border agency officers receive detailed forgery and detection training and last year detected over 27,000 forged travel or supporting documents used to support visa applications worldwide."

There are currently around 1,300 powers to allow public bodies to enter private homes and businesses to enable investigations to be carried out.

All government bodies are currently examining the powers they have and, in line with the recently-passed Protection of Freedoms Act, must report to Parliament next year to set out which powers are unnecessary and can be repealed.

The new code will support enhanced safeguards for householders and business owners by ensuring the proportionate use of all powers.

Lord Taylor, Minister for Criminal Information, said: ‘This government is rolling back unnecessary state intrusion into people’s private lives.

‘Powers of entry will always be vital for the investigation of crime, but this new code of practice will ensure they are used proportionately and not abused.

‘Government departments are already working to reduce the 1,300 powers available to them and our new code will further strengthen safeguards.’

The code of practice will include guidance for the use of any powers, including, where appropriate, a recommendation to give 48 hours’ notice and to be considerate over the time of day powers are executed."

The Charter has four points:

Equalities minister Lynne Featherstone said: ‘Sport should be about what you can do, not who you are. But too many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people feel that the sports field is not somewhere they can be themselves, and that prejudice and discrimination will mean their sexuality is always talked about more than their ability with a ball, bat or racket.

‘Homophobia and transphobia has no place in sport and I’m delighted that so many sporting bodies are backing our campaign to stamp it out at all levels, from local parks to Olympic stadiums.

‘Everyone - including individual sportsmen and women and spectators - is welcome to sign up to the charter, and I want to see as many people as possible joining us in pledging to stamp out homophobia and transphobia.’

Alex Horne, General Secretary of the Football Association, said: ‘The FA and its stakeholders have worked hard over the years in providing football for all and ensuring that football stadia are open to everyone and are both family and LGB and T friendly.

‘We’ve seen real progress over the last 20 years when it comes to tackling racism and that’s something football should be proud of. We remain committed to our long-term goal of removing all forms of discrimination, such as homophobia, out of the game.’

It’s not just governing bodies that are welcome to sign up to the Charter. As well as governing bodies, the charter is also open to leagues, teams, and individual participants and spectators. You can show your support for the Charter by signing up to it on Facebook.

The Charter for Action is one part of the new cross-government LGB and T action plan, which was published today. It sets out what all government departments are going to do to support LGB and T equality in the coming year.

On Sunday 13 March Lynne Featherstone will be attending a Sheffield Eagles Rugby League game at Bramall Lane, Sheffield, to thank the Eagles for their commitment to tackling homophobia on and off the field. The Minister will be available for embargoed interviews on the launch of the charter. To attend, contact Alex Marklew in the Home Office press office on 020 7035 3245 / 07833 402 039.

The study looked at brothels in seven regions of the country. That information was then extrapolated out for all of England and Wales.

Researchers estimate there are 6000 brothels, which employ 30,000 sex workers.

Of those:

The report found that 1300 of the trafficking victims were from China, and most of the rest were from southeast Asia (primarily Thailand) and Eastern Europe.

The background of local prostitutes varied widely by region: in London, 96 per cent of women involved in prostitution were found to be immigrants, while in Yorkshire, just under 32 per cent were immigrants.

Immigration Minister Damian Green said, ‘In order to combat trafficking more effectively we need to understand it better, and Project Acumen marks significant progress.

‘Having any number of people trafficked into the UK is unacceptable, therefore it is vital that we use Acumen to re-focus our efforts both at targeting the criminal gangs that trade in this human misery and in helping victims escape and recover from their ordeal.’

Details of the scheme were announced today, as the home secretary revealed almost 5,000 female mentors have joined the government’s drive to kick-start growth by encouraging more women to start or build their own companies.

Home secretary and minister for women and equalities Theresa May said:

‘Women are vital to Britain’s economic future and the support of a mentor will help even more of them fulfil their true potential.

‘The government is working hard to help women make the most of their talents, but we cannot act alone. I’m delighted by these mentors’ commitment to helping budding businesswomen succeed - and to making Britain prosper.’

Equalities minister Lynne Featherstone said:

‘Britain has many talented women who will thrive as these rural growth networks give them the tools they need to launch or develop their own businesses.

‘Women are about half as likely as men to become entrepreneurs and we need to harness their untapped skills. Living in a rural area can also present specific challenges that these projects aim to address.’

The Cumbria Local Enterprise Partnership is one of five across the country which will benefit from government funding for Rural Growth Networks to provide tailored support to tackle the barriers that businesswomen face in the area. Inspiring women in the region, who could benefit from this assistance, include:

If women started businesses at the same rate as men there would be an additional 150,000 start-ups a year, and if female entrepreneurship reached the same levels as the US it would contribute an extra £42 billion to the economy.

The £2 million has been allocated to projects dedicated to women as part of a £15 million package of support for the five rural growth networks from the department for environment, food and rural affairs that is expected to create more than 3,000 new jobs and 700 businesses.

Environment secretary Caroline Spelman said:

‘Women who want to go back to work or set up their own company should not be held back by living in remote places. We want to help all women across the country turn their great business ideas into profitable rural businesses.

‘Rural growth networks will create thousands of new jobs and hundreds of start-up companies by fixing problems rural businesses face, like a shortage of work premises and limited internet access.’

The home secretary also announced updates to a range of additional support for women in business:

Women’s business council - the council is today publishing the work programme for its one-year mission to identify and break down the barriers to female success;Women and banks - The government is revealing the initial findings of its review to ensure women have equal access to the finance they need to start a business;‘Think, act, report’ - case studies are being published today showing how adopting the principles behind the government’s voluntary approach to diversity at work has helped leading firms reap business rewards.

Case studies and quotes from the mentoring champions are available from the home office press office.

The home secretary pledged to fund the recruitment and training of 5,000 female mentors last November. This is on top of 10,000 (male and female) mentors subsequently announced by the department for business.

Training can be accessed through free workshops or online and distance learning.

Free training will be open to volunteers new to mentoring, those who run their own business with 250 employees or fewer, are business support professionals, or work for a company employing fewer than 250 people.

Mentors are asked to provide a minimum of one hour free business mentoring a month to an owner of a micro, small, or medium sized business over the next two years (or equivalent).

The women’s business council has started a year-long probe into how to increase women’s contribution to the economy by identifying the issues they face and finding practical solutions.

The council is today announcing its plan of work. It will use its business expertise to look at women’s entire working life - including education, finding a job or starting a business, juggling childcare and a career, succeeding in senior roles and preparing for retirement. Crucially, the WBC will examine from a business perspective how these issues affect employers’ ability to hire the talent they need.

Women’s business council chair Ruby McGregor-Smith said:

‘This is an exciting opportunity to make a real difference to women’s lives, to business success and to economic growth. We are looking at the entire life-cycle to see what holds women back and what government, business and others can do to address this.’

The government is undertaking a review into claims that women are being discriminated against by banks in their lending decisions.

Deputy prime minister Nick Clegg commissioned the equalities minister, Lynne Featherstone, to review the claims made by a 2011 IPPR report called ‘women and banks - are female customers facing discrimination?’. Lynne Featherstone is working with the british bankers’ association, the council for mortgage lenders and other industry bodies to identify actions to address this critical area and ensure female entrepreneurs are confident they have the same access to funds as their male counterparts.

Equalities minister Lynne Featherstone said:

‘It is completely unacceptable if banks are discriminating against women. Women should receive exactly the same service in accessing financial help as their male counterparts. We are working with the british bankers’ association and other industry representatives to identify what can be done by the financial sector to support women and to set out an action plan. Greater transparency by lenders in the way they go about their business is needed to ensure women have confidence to access the finance they need without the fear of being discriminated against.’

A parallel review on business lending to ethnic minority entrepreneurs and businesses is being conducted by the department for communities and local government.

Equalities minister Lynne Featherstone announced a new safeguard on equal pay last week which will give employment tribunals the power to require an employer who loses an equal pay case to carry out a pay audit, where there is likely to be systemic discrimination.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/letter-from-the-cabinet-secretary,News story,Letter from the Cabinet Secretary,Sir Gus O'Donnell has responded to Andy Burnham's letter of 31 August 2011.,Department for Education,23 September 2011,"The Cabinet Secretary, Sir Gus O’Donnell, has responded to Andy Burnham’s letter of 31 August 2011. The text of the letter is below.

Dear Andy,

New Schools Network

Thank you for your letter of 31 August 2011 regarding the above subject.

You have asked a number of questions about the award of a grant by the Department for Education (DfE) to the New Schools Network (NSN) and about appointments of staff in DfE. I should start by highlighting that the spending decisions of individual departments, including those relating to the award of contracts, and decisions about recruitment, are a matter for each department’s Accounting Officer. In this case, that is Sir David Bell, the Permanent Secretary at DfE. I note that you have already written to him on this matter, and that he has provided assurances that appropriate steps were followed in the award of this grant.

The decision to sign off the grant for the NSN without holding an open competition was a matter for Sir David. In his letter to you last November, he indicated that officials had advised Ministers on the process for awarding a short-term grant to the NSN and that, as Accounting Officer, he had considered and approved this approach. Not only was it a short-term grant arrangement, but the NSN were uniquely placed to do the work and there was no legal obligation to conduct a competitive process. As you are aware, several similar grants were awarded to organisations under the previous administration, which Sir David and I remain entirely comfortable with. I believe there is nothing in the emails that you refer to as having recently come to light which calls into question the appropriateness of the grant award.

I understand that the grant is due to end on 30 September following an unfunded extension for the NSN to carry out pro bono work until then. Information outlining details of a competitive grant process for any future work was published on the DfE’s website on 5 September. It is available here: http://www.education.gov.uk/aboutdfe/policiesandprocedures/procurement/a0037/current-contracts-advertised-by-the-department

Turning to your questions regarding the various Civil Service, Special Adviser and Ministerial Codes, I am satisfied that these were not contravened during the process of awarding a grant to the NSN.

Finally, you asked about various appointments that have been made by the Secretary of State for Education since 2010. You refer to meetings between Dominic Cummings, Ministers and officials, prior to Mr Cummings’ appointment in February 2011, and specifically to whether or not Mr Cummings was instructing Civil Servants. As I’m sure you are aware, Civil Servants in all Departments only take instructions from Ministers (via private offices) and more senior Civil Servants and of course, there was no question of Mr Cummings being able to instruct Civil Servants.

In terms of other appointments you refer to, I understand that the appointments of two speechwriters and the Head of Communications were conducted through fair and open competition, with external adverts and interviews conducted by permanent Civil Servants. In the case of the Communications Director role, which is a Senior Civil Service position, the panel was chaired by Sir David Bell, and the whole process overseen by an independent Civil Service Commissioner. I understand there are two senior policy advisers in the DfE, Sam Freedman and Janet Grauberg. They are both employed as Civil Servants and their employment was subject to the rules which govern Civil Service appointments for these particular posts.

I should stress that all Civil Servants, regardless of background (political or otherwise), are subject, once in post, to the Civil Service code of conduct. This sets out very clearly the need for all Civil Servants to adhere to the Civil Service values of honesty, integrity, objectivity and impartiality, including political impartiality.

I am copying this letter to Sir David Bell.

Yours ever,

Gus O’Donnell

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dounreay-completes-first-phase-of-nuclear-transports,News story,Dounreay completes first phase of nuclear transports,Dounreay has completed the transfer of 11 tonnes of nuclear material to Sellafield.,Dounreay and Nuclear Decommissioning Authority,1 June 2015,"The material, a legacy of the site’s fast reactor programme, consisted of rods of natural uranium that had been irradiated to breed new plutonium fuel for power stations.

Known as “breeder”, 11 tonnes of the material was removed from the Dounreay Fast Reactor after its closure in 1977 and stored at the site.

In 2011, after canvassing the views of the public on the options, the decision was taken by the UK Government to remove it from Dounreay.

In December 2012, the first of 32 shipments left the site by road and rail. The final shipment arrived in Sellafield earlier this month, where it is being reprocessed.

Extensive checks carried out before, during and after each move confirmed the transport was carried out without incident and in compliance with safety and security regulations.

Alex Potts, deputy director of fuels at Dounreay, said the smooth transfer was made possible by the close working of Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd with Sellafield Ltd, Direct Rail Services Ltd, flask supplier Magnox Ltd, the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, Police Scotland, British Transport Police and regulatory bodies.

Together, we have delivered safely and without harm to the public or the environment the first phase of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority’s programme to consolidate its inventory of nuclear fuel and materials in the UK.

It significantly reduces the amount of nuclear material at Dounreay and takes us another step closer towards the closure of the site.

TheNDAinherited approximately 100 tonnes of nuclear fuel and material which is now being returned to national stocks.

A further 33 tonnes of breeder material remains inside the Dounreay Fast Reactor and is also scheduled to be transported to Sellafield.

Purpose-built retrieval equipment has been installed above the reactor and is now undergoing a series of tests.

Work is also continuing in preparation for the transfer of other types of nuclear fuel and material that had accumulated at the site when its research and development role came to an end in 1994.

The UK Government’s decision to remove its nuclear fuel and material from Dounreay has resulted in a rescheduling of some other decommissioning work to accommodate the additional costs associated with transport, with a new date of 2030 now projected for completion of the site clean-up and closure."

Paul Foggin leads the area’s immigration crime team. He explained: ‘These arrests are the result of work with various registrars, vicars and registry offices, and reflect how seriously the UK Border Agency takes abuse of the immigration system.’Immigration minister Damian Green added: ‘The UK Border Agency is stepping up its efforts to further disrupt the activities of people involved in facilitating immigration crime including white collar professionals who seek to abuse immigration law. Our officers are also working with other law enforcement agencies to root out criminal networks behind the importation of illegal drugs and firearms.‘Illegal immigration puts huge pressure on the public purse at a time when the country can least afford it.’

Since July more than 400 operations have taken place across the country resulting in over 800 arrests and over £500,000 cash seized under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Many of these investigations are ongoing.Anyone who suspects that illegal workers are being employed at a business can contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 where anonymity can be assured or visit theUK Border Agency website.

The £10 million fabrication contract is bringing together suppliers from across the UK with the engineering skills capable of meeting the exacting standards of the nuclear industry.

The unirradiated fuel characterisation facility is being assembled and tested at Yate, Bristol, before it is dismantled and taken to Dounreay early in 2015.

Dounreay is partway through its decommissioning programme, one of the largest in Europe, and the return of its re-useable fuel inventory to national stocks is a key part of the site closure plan.

The NDA inherited approximately 100 tonnes of nuclear fuel at Dounreay – a legacy of 20th century R & D into more efficient ways to generate electricity from fast breeder reactors.

The UK-owned fuel began to leave the site in 2012 following the Government decision to consolidate the UK’s fuel inventory at Sellafield in Cumbria.

The fuel characterisation facility will process unirradiated material currently stored at  Dounreay in various solid forms, in a series of glove boxes which will allow operators to handle the fuel remotely.

Local companies have been involved in the manufacture, construction and assembly of the line, which was designed by AECOM for Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd, the site licence company.

They include JGC Engineering, Gows Lybster, John Gunn & Sons, MM Miller, Nuvia, Jacobs and Arch Henderson & Partners.

The various components of the line have been assembled at the Yate, Bristol premises of main contractor Redhall. Here the full range of the process will be assembled and tested and any remedial work carried out. Once testing has been completed, it will be transported to Dounreay where it will be reassembled.

Commissioning of the line is expected to take a further six months and, subject to regulatory agreement from the Office for Nuclear Regulation, the operation of the line is expected to last for three years.

Nigel Lowe, NDA’s Head of Programme at Dounreay, said:

The site is being dismantled and is heading towards closure over the coming decades, but the workforce have retained their skills in managing high-tech projects: the UFCF line is testament to this. The DSRL team, the supply chain and Redhall can be justly proud of what has been achieved."

The independent body will protect the public interest by enhancing police standards, identifying evidence of what works in policing and sharing best practice among officers.

It will provide a range of functions from supporting the education and professional development of staff and officers to setting standards for specialist skills training such as investigation, intelligence and firearms.

Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘The police service must be radically reformed in order to meet growing challenges and deliver the most effective service possible.

‘At the core of this reform will be a newCollege of Policingwhich will be representative of all officer and staff ranks and led by the service itself, to ensure that officers have the right training and skills for the future.

‘Together with directly electedpolice and crime commissionersand the new National Crime Agency our reform agenda will improve policing, delivering better value for the taxpayer and give the public a stronger voice.’

The College of Policing will set standards of entry for those who want to become a police officer and will provide some specialist training itself.  It will also consider opening up the police training market to offer value for money in addition to providing careers advice for those who want to move through the ranks and setting standards for promotion and progression.

The body will forge links between the police service and universities, encouraging future academics to specialise in looking at how policing can be made more effective.

The current role of all ACPO business areas in developing national standards and police practice will also come under the responsibility of the College of Policing.

He said:’A healthy society requires the police and public to be at ease with each other, and the triumph of the policing operation at the Olympic and Paralympic games is testament to this.

‘Visitors to Olympic Park and other venues, spectators at the torch relay, and tourists or residents of London were only able to throw themselves into the spirit of the games because of the work that dedicated officers were doing quietly behind the scenes.  I want this easier relationship between the police and the public to be one of the legacies of the games.’

The minister spoke the day after the Home Secretary addressed the conference in which she outlined how government reforms to policing would benefit both the public and the police."

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/breaking-down-barriers-to-adoption,Press release,Breaking down barriers to adoption,Secretary of State for Education and Children's Minister Tim Loughton announce plans to increase the number and timeliness of adoptions.,"Department for Education, The Rt Hon Michael Gove and Tim Loughton",22 February 2011,"Too many children in care are being denied loving homes and the chance of a stable upbringing with adoptive parents, Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove said today at an event to raise the profile of adoption.

Progress in adoption has stalled in recent years, with the number of children placed for adoption falling by 15 per cent between March 2009 and 2010 and more children waiting longer to be adopted. Black children took on average over 50 per cent longer to be placed for adoption than children from other ethnic groups. And children over five were four times less likely to be adopted compared to children under five in the last year.

The Government wants to see more children adopted where this is in their best interests, particularly those from ethnic minority backgrounds, older children and those with disabilities. Some of these children are not even considered for adoption. Local authorities and voluntary adoption agencies should also be more welcoming towards all potential adopters - and not turn people away on the grounds of race, age or social background.

The Government is looking at what more can be done to improve this situation, including:

Speaking ahead of an event at Coram’s Foundling Museum, Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove said:

Thousands of children are currently in the care system waiting to be adopted. Every day they wait is a day they’re denied the loving home all children deserve. But politically correct attitudes and ridiculous bureaucracy keep many of those children waiting far too long. Edicts which say children have to be adopted by families with the same ethnic background and which prevent other families adopting because they don’t fit left- wing prescriptions are denying children the love they need.

As a result children from ethnic minority backgrounds languish in care for longer than other kids and are denied the opportunities they deserve. This misguided nonsense punishes those who most need our help and that is why this government is sweeping it away.

Children’s Minister Tim Loughton said:

Adoption can provide a permanent loving home for a child in care, so it’s disappointing that the latest statistics show a decline in adoption rates and significant variation across the country. Some local authorities place just two per cent of their children in care for adoption compared to 16 per cent in other parts of the country. While there are many fantastic local authorities and voluntary adoption agencies, I want all the professionals involved in adoption to take note of the updated guidance. I want to see more children placed for adoption, where this is in their best interests, particularly those who may have been overlooked, like older children, children from BME backgrounds and those with disabilities.

Over the coming months, I will be looking at whether the current inspection arrangements for adoption services can be strengthened. I also want local authorities and voluntary adoption agencies to welcome people who come forward to adopt. While not all people will be suitable, local authorities and voluntary adoption agencies should give everyone who  approaches them a fair hearing and in no Circumstances turn them away because of their race, age or social background.

It’s unacceptable for vulnerable children to be denied the chance of a loving, permanent home when there are suitable parents available to adopt children.

Adoption guidance published today makes clear that local authorities should be considering adoption as an important option for more children and should be pursuing this with more vigour.

The guidance also makes clear that:

The Government wants to see improvements in adoption practice across the country so that all areas are providing a quality service for children in their care and families wanting to adopt. As of January this year, 76 per cent of LA adoption agencies were rated good or outstanding by Ofsted. This isn’t necessarily reflected in the number and timeliness of adoptions taking place. Tim Loughton will be exploring with Ofsted the current inspection regime for LA adoption agencies and whether this could be strengthened.

To help break down barriers and reduce delay in the system, the Government has set up a Ministerial Advisory Group on Adoption to provide expert advice on a range of practical proposals. This includes a pilot, run by BAAF, to support and challenge local authorities to make better use of the Adoption Register so that more children and families can be matched more quickly.

Dr Carol Homden, Chief Executive of children’s charity Coram, said:

This guidance is great, but action is necessary. During these particularly challenging economic times, a short term view of cost or bureaucratic rigidity must not be allowed to dictate a child’s future.

We know it doesn’t have to be like this - Coram’s results in finding loving, stable homes for the most difficult to place children speak for themselves.

Coram’s partnership with Harrow Council has ensured the successful placement of every child needing adoption within six months and cost savings of £440,000 - particularly pertinent at a time when local authority finances are under pressure. Investment now will save costs in the future, but most importantly, further unnecessary heartache for our most vulnerable children.

David Holmes, Chief Executive of the British Association for Adoption and Fostering (BAAF) said:

We welcome the Government’s firm commitment to adoption and in particular the publication of this timely new guidance which we contributed to extensively.

It is important to recognise that there is much good practice already in adoption although this is not always uniformly applied. The challenge is to ensure that every agency builds on best practice to ensure that no child is deprived of a loving adoptive home.

Adoption provides very clear benefits to children in very vulnerable circumstances - we must all ensure that whenever a child needs adoption that that plan is realised without delay.

Anne Marie Carrie, Barnardo’s Chief Executive said:

With adoption levels reaching a new low, today’s news is a triumph for all of the children from BME backgrounds who have waited far too long to be adopted into stable, loving homes.

Barnardo’s has raised concerns that the fixation on race is acting as a barrier to adoption in the UK. The new guidance contains the right balance between the importance of culture and ethnicity and the need for urgency when matching children with families.

Barnardo’s believes the new guidance reaffirms the importance of keeping the child at the centre of every decision.

Addressing officers at the conference in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, the Home Secretary said: ‘Our reforms are not complete, but with your help and your leadership we are moving closer to realising a vision of the future with greater trust and accountability, where both the police and the public are winners.’

The college, to be established before the end of the year, will recognise the talent and experience already in policing and ensure forces have the right tools to protect the public.

The Home Secretary said the college will ‘provide greater transparency to the public about what they can expect from their force and the standards that it should meet’.

Speaking at the conference, the Home Secretary praised the ‘leadership and self sacrifice’ shown by officers during the Olympic and Paralympic Games and welcomed a call from Derek Barnett, the outgoing President of the Association, for closer links between officers and the government.

She reiterated her call for the police to focus on cutting crime but said it was down to individual officers to decide how best to do it.

Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘Cutting crime doesn’t just mean the number of arrests which are made, the number of incidents responded to or the number of successful prosecutions.

‘In fact, I am quite clear that it can mean a range of activity, including early intervention, tackling anti-social behaviour or providing effective public order policing.

‘All of these examples are just as legitimate as chasing robbers.’

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/passport-price-reduction-coming-in,Press release,Passport price reduction coming in,From Monday people applying for a standard passport will only have to pay £72.50.,Home Office and The Rt Hon Damian Green,31 August 2012,"This is a reduction of £5 from the previous cost of £77.50 and will stay in place until March 2015. The price reduction is being introduced after a restructuring programme at IPS, resulting in savings of £40 million in the last financial year.

The UK passport, which is valid for 10 years, is cheaper than the equivalent in Australia (£152) and the USA (£88.36). It is also cheaper than New Zealand, where a five year passport is £77.76.

Immigration Minister Damian Green said:

‘It is good news that IPS have made savings which will be passed on to the public who use their services.

‘This reduction is due to the hard work of all at IPS and I commend them for their dedication in delivering a stronger and leaner service in these tough economic times.’

IPS Chief Executive Sarah Rapson said:

‘The UK passport is one of the most trusted and secure documents in the world and last year we produced 5.4 million.

‘I am pleased that we have also been able to deliver a more efficient service whilst maintaining a high standard.

‘We are committed to giving fee payers better value for money and this reduction is testament to the hard work of all involved here.’

The savings mean that the majority of passport customers, including children and those who pay extra for a premium or fast track service, will benefit from a fee reduction as follows:

ACall for Evidence, published today (29 July), sets out the government’s suggested approach to building the first advanced modular reactor (AMR) demonstrator. This will specifically explore high temperature gas reactors (HTGRs) as the most promising model for the demonstration programme, which ministers are investing £170 million into delivering by the early 2030s.

AMRsare typically smaller than conventional nuclear power stations, more flexible, and could be built at a fraction of a cost. It is hoped that as well as safely creating electricity to power homes on the grid,HTGRswill also be able to generate low-carbon hydrogen. In addition, thanks to also generating extremely high temperature heat, they could help decarbonise industry and potentially power district heating networks by the 2040s.

Around a third (37%) of the UK’s carbon emissions come from heat, with a significant portion from heavy industrial processes. By generating heat at between 500 and 950°C - higher than other types ofAMR-HTGRscould significantly cut emissions from processes such as cement, paper, glass and chemical production in the UK’s industrial heartlands.

Ministers are today inviting views from industry and the public on the government’s preference to explore the potential ofHTGRsfor itsAMRdemonstration project.

Minister of State for Energy, Anne Marie Trevelyan, said:

While renewables like wind and solar will become an integral part of where our electricity will come from by 2050, they will always require a stable low-carbon baseload from nuclear. That is why, alongside negotiations with the developers of Sizewell C in Suffolk, we are pressing ahead with harnessing new and exciting advanced nuclear technology.

Advanced modular reactors are the next level of modern nuclear technology and have the potential to play a crucial role not only in tackling carbon emissions, but also in powering industry and driving forward Britain’s economic growth, as we build back greener.

Today’s step builds on the commitment made in theEnergy White Paperand the Prime Minister’sTen Point Planfor £170 million of investment in anR&Dprogramme for Advanced Modular Reactors, as part of a £385 million package to accelerate the development of more flexible nuclear technologies.

AMRsuse new types of fuel and coolants compared to conventional reactors, which tend to use water for cooling. Internationally, there are 6 main types ofAMRtechnology, which could play a role in achieving net zero, with some potentially re-using spent nuclear materials as new fuel. However, with one of the highest temperature outputs,HTGRsare being considered for the demonstrator programme.

Independent research from the University of Manchester’s Dalton Nuclear Institute, Royal Society and the Energy Systems Catapult have concluded thatAMRscould play a vital role in supporting a future clean energy system.

While today’s reactors are already extremely safe,AMRsalso seek to build even further on the high safety features of conventional reactors.

Fellow at the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering, Dame Sue Ion, said:

This proposal is extremely welcome news and demonstrates the tremendous potential of advanced nuclear power, which could be expanded safely to improve the overall efficiency of our energy system, but also help decarbonize difficult to help heavy industry, to help meet the UK’s net-zero goal.

This Advanced Modular Reactor demonstration plays to the UK strengths in nuclear fuel and gas cooled reactors in building a technology platform forHTGRsfor the UK to exploit and potentially export internationally.

The government continues to support the development of a wide variety of nuclear technologies, and is today also announcing the piloting of an Advanced Nuclear Skills and Innovation Campus, being developed by the National Nuclear Laboratory. Located in Preston, it will serve as an innovation hub, bringing together industry and academia to collaborate on projects which help develop and commercialise advanced nuclear technologies.

Meanwhile, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) is preparing to submit a summary of evidence on nuclear energy to the Energy Working Group (EWG), which will help inform how to address nuclear energy in the Green Taxonomy.

The Green Taxonomy will be a common framework setting the bar for investments that can be defined as environmentally sustainable, helping clamp down on greenwashing – unsubstantiated or exaggerated claims that an investment is environmentally friendly. It will make it easier for investors and consumers to understand how a firm is impacting the environment to encourage greater investments in funds that will help the UK achieve net zero.

ThisCall for Evidenceseeks to strengthen the government’s evidence base around the potential of advanced modular reactors (AMRs) and high temperature gas reactors (HTGRs) in particular, to support net zero by 2050, as committed in the Ten Point plan and Energy White Paper. Feedback will be used to support the development of anAMRR&Ddemonstration programme.

There are many possible types ofAMRsbut 6 have been selected by the Generation IV International Forum for further research and development:

Read the Royal Society’sreport on the benefits ofAMRsandHTGRsin particular.

AMRsare one of 2 types of advanced nuclear technologies being explored by the government. The other is small modular reactors (SMRs), which use existing pressurised water reactor (PWR) technology, and which are likely to be able to be mass-produced and transported, flat-pack-style, to parts of the country that need them.

The government is also to extend theAdvanced Fuel Cycle Programme, delivered in co-operation with the National Nuclear laboratory (NNL). This will continue to build world-leading capability in advanced nuclear fuels for use in more near-termSMRsandAMRs."

The most significant democratic reform of policing in our lifetime will be about to come to life as 41 elected Police and Crime Commissioners in England and Wales take office.

‘Police and Crime Commissioners will need to be outstanding leaders. They will be hugely important figures and the role will be demanding and challenging. The first set of elected PCCs will be pioneers, driving through changes in relatively uncharted territory. They will need a firm resolve and commitment to engage with the public, listen and respond to their needs’ he added.

Individual Police and Crime Commissioners will be directly elected by local communities to be the voice of the people and hold the police to account on behalf of the communities they serve.

They will determine how crime fighting resources are allocated and, in many cases, be responsible for budgets of tens of millions of pounds. They will determine how much local taxpayers should pay for their police force and, in consultation with their chief constable, decide the priorities for their police force.

They will also appoint, and if necessary dismiss, the chief constable.

‘These are big jobs for big figures’ the Policing Minister said today.

Nick Herbert went on to set out his vision that PCCs be made up of people from all walks of life to stand and make a difference for local communities. He reiterated that candidates don’t have to be politicians to stand and could be independent of political parties.

He also called upon people from all sides of the debate to now come together to support this radical reform of policing in England and Wales and play a part in ensuring it is a success. Setting out the vigorous discussion and scrutiny of the government’s plan that has taken place over the last eighteen months, as well as the steps the government has taken to listen to concerns and make sure the British model of impartial policing is preserved, the Minister concluded: ‘Parliament has now spoken’.

‘It is time for everyone to move on from the debate about the merits of reform, and work together to ensure the reforms are a success not just for the sake of the police, but above all for the sake of the public’ the Minister said.

Today we have launched a dedicated section on the Home Office website for members of the public and those interested in finding out more about the role of PCCs."

The Prime Minister will launch the innovative new Ayrton Fund to give developing countries access to the latest cutting-edge tech to help reduce their emissions and meet global climate change targets.

British expertise is already at the forefront of clean energy and global efforts to fight climate change. In the UK we have harnessed the power of renewable energy to cut our emissions by over 40 per cent – faster than any other G20 country – while growing our economy by more than two thirds.

British engineers are also helping revolutionise zero-emission transport at home and abroad. Last year, one in five electric vehicles sold in Europe was made in the UK.

The new fund is named after leading British scientist and suffragette Hertha Ayrton – a pioneering physicist, mathematician and inventor whose work contributed to major scientific advancements at the turn of the 20th century, including in electricity.

Her research into the flow of water and air also inspired the Ayrton fan which was used on the Western Front in the First World War to dispel poison gas from British soldiers in the trenches.

The UK is home to some of the world’s best innovators in clean energy technology. Through the Ayrton Fund they and other scientists from around the world can work in partnership with developing countries to transform their energy sectors and reduce emissions by:

Speaking ahead of today’s climate change event at the UN, the Prime Minister said:

Britain is a nation of innovators. Our scientists have been at the forefront of technological advancement for generations, pioneering world-changing inventions like the jet engine, the television and the lightbulb.

I have always been deeply optimistic about the potential of technology to make the world a better place. If we get this right, future generations will look back on climate change as a problem that we solved by determined global action and the prowess of technology.

The new fund I’m launching today rightly honours Hertha Ayrton – one of Britain’s most extraordinary minds who drove relentlessly to improve our scientific understanding and left a legacy of innovation and creativity for which the world owes an immeasurable debt.

This innovative use of aid money benefits all of us and shows how we can use our aid budget to tackle climate change. The Ayrton Fund will back scientists and our world-leading tech industry – reducing emissions in the poorest countries with the help of our home-grown talent.

Business and Energy Secretary Andrea Leadsom said:

The UK is leading the world in tackling climate change – cutting emissions further than any other G20 country, becoming the first major economy to legislate to end our contribution to global warming and being nominated to host crucial UN climate talks next year.

Having successfully decarbonised while growing our economy, we’re proud to work with the poorest countries, who suffer most from the impacts of climate change, to develop and deploy wind, solar and battery technology to help drive the clean energy transition.

International Development Secretary Alok Sharma said:

Climate Change will hit the poorest communities hardest and fastest. The UK’s pioneering work through the Ayrton Fund will find innovative ways to develop clean energy solutions for homes, which will transform the lives of the most vulnerable."

Currently in its 2nd year with the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Bath and Imperial College London, the pilot will streamline the process for international students looking to study on a Masters course of 13 months or less in the UK.

It also provides greater support for students who wish to switch to a work visa and take up a graduate role, by allowing them to remain in the UK for 6 months after they have finished their course.

Universities taking part are given responsibility for eligibility checks, meaning that students can submit fewer documents than required in the current process alongside their visa applications.

Applicants that do not meet immigration rules will be refused. All students will continue to require Home Office security and identity checks.

The additional 23 universities to benefit from the pilot include 2 in Scotland, 2 in Wales and 1 in Northern Ireland as well as universities from across England.

Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis said:

I am delighted to announce the expansion of this pilot which is part of our ongoing activity to ensure that our world-leading institutions remain highly competitive.

The UK continues to be the 2nd most popular destination for international students and the number coming to study at our universities has increased by 24% since 2010.

This is a clear indication that genuine students are welcome and there is no limit on the number who can come to study in the UK.

The most recent Home Office statistics show that the number of students applying for visas increased by 8% over the past year, and there has been a 9% increase in the number of students applying to Russell Group universities.

The 23 additional universities will be able to apply the pilot to their 2018/19 intake. The universities were selected as their visa refusal rates are consistently the lowest in their area or region.

The final structure, a holding area for the site’s solid remote handled waste, was pulled apart remotely using a robotic demolition machine (Brokk 180). It has allowed the facility ventilation system to be shut down in order to complete the last phase of decommissioning before the building structure is demolished later this year.

Project Manager Bill Lambie said:

“This marks the end of a lengthy campaign to decommission the DMTR complex and allows us to demolish the support building.  It is a significant achievement, made possible through the skills, ingenuity and hard work of the engineers, supervisors and decommissioning operatives who are part of the project team, and also by working closely with other support functions.”

The extension, until the end of September, comes alongside further support to help local businesses plan for economic recovery following the coronavirus pandemic.

A newcode of practicehas been developed with leaders from the retail, hospitality and property sectors to provide clarity for businesses when discussing rental payments and to encourage best practice so that all parties are supported.

These interventions are in addition to the comprehensive financial package provided by the UK government to businesses during this difficult time and is in recognition of the strain that the sector is currently under.

The code is voluntary for businesses and is relevant to all commercial leases held by businesses in any sector which have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.

It encourages tenants to continue to pay their rent in full if they are in a position to do so and advises that others should pay what they can, whilst acknowledging that landlords should provide support to businesses if they too are able to do so.

The suspension of the forfeiture of evictions will come as a relief in particular to pubs, cafes and restaurants, after the hospitality sector called upon the government for action in this area.

Communities Secretary, Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:

As our high streets come to life and our town centres open for business, it is crucial that both landlords and tenants have clarity and reassurance as they seek to keep their finances stable and bounce back.

That is why we are extending measures to protect those who are unable to pay rent from eviction so that businesses have the security they need to plan for their futures.

And in recognition of the strain that the virus has had on our high streets, our new code, backed by leaders across the industry, will help unlock conversations on rent and future payments whilst ensuring best practice is displayed across the board as we confront the challenges of this pandemic.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma MP said:

From clothes stores to our local book shop, we want as many high street businesses as possible to emerge from the pandemic, in the best position to bounce back.

During this particularly challenging time for businesses, our retail stores are safely welcoming shoppers back and taking the necessary steps to drive economic recovery.

By putting a stop to unreasonable evictions, these measures will protect jobs and provide further flexibility to our high street businesses that were trading successfully before the COVID-19 emergency, so they can focus on continuing to deliver for their customers and communities.

Across the UK, the code will encourage tenants and landlords to be transparent in their discussions and to act reasonably and responsibly whilst recognising the impact that coronavirus has had on businesses’ finances.

The UK government has confirmed the following changes to the existing package of measures for the commercial sector:

UK Finance has alsoconfirmedits members’ continued support for commercial landlord customers including amendments to facilities and capital payment holidays.

The UK government’s financial package of measures to support businesses during the economic emergency includes:

View thecode of practice.

It was developed and coordinated by the UK government alongside a working group of the following, who have all endorsed the code; British Chambers of Commerce, British Property Federation, British Retail Consortium, the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council, Revo, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and UKHospitality.

The working group was also supported by Trowers & Hamlins LLP who provided expert legal advice during the code’s development.

To date, a number of other organisations have also endorsed the code including; Agricultural Law Association; Association of Convenience Stores; British Beer and Pubs Association, British Independent Retailers Association, Central Association of Agricultural Valuers, Country Land Association, Federation of Small Businesses, Property Owners Forum, Scottish Property Federation, Tenant Farmers Association and Tenant Farmers Association Cymru, UKActive and UK Major Ports Group.

Jane Gratton, Head of People Policy, British Chambers of Commerce said:

The pandemic has created severe cashflow problems for many SMEs, who will need time to rebuild and recover.  This code will help landlords and tenants to work together constructively to find solutions that keep businesses open and people in work.

Melanie Leech, Chief Executive, British Property Federation said:

The majority of property owners and occupiers are already working well together, creating shared solutions to mitigate the impact of coronavirus on their businesses. The code of practice published today builds on the many examples of good practice and reinforces the importance of constructive collaboration – not only over the next few months and once the government’s temporary legislative interventions come to an end later this year, but for the long term.

The success of landlords and tenants working together as economic partners is vital to the UK’s recovery and to help ensure that viable businesses in distress as a result of coronavirus are supported, to protect both people’s jobs and the local authorities, savers and pensioners who own the majority of our town centres.

Helen Dickinson, Chief Executive, British Retail Consortium said:

The ongoing pandemic presents an enormous threat to the survival of thousands of retailers, and the millions of jobs they support. The necessary closure of most shops during lockdown has created a gaping hole in many retailers’ finances. This has been exacerbated by continued rent demands on stores around the country, even where most have been closed for business. A solution is needed.

This code is a first step toward improving the dialogue between retailers and their landlords. An extension to tenant protections against aggressive behaviour from some landlords is essential to underpin it, and we warmly welcome the government’s commitment to this.

However, all parties should recognise that the code does not provide a solution for those retailers who are simply unable to pay what is being demanded, and we now look forward to continuing our constructive dialogue with government and other parts of the property sector to address these unpayable rents. Without further action, both retailers and landlords remain in a precarious situation that could lead to substantial numbers of redundancies as soon as tenant protections expire.

Peter Cosmetatos, Chief Executive, Commercial Real Estate Finance Council said:

Commercial real estate investment and finance markets are a complex, interconnected ecosystem; the pandemic-related stress affecting so many rent-paying businesses also threatens their landlords, and their investors and their lenders, with potential implications for economic recovery.

This code cannot magically plug revenue holes, but it sends a strong signal that good faith engagement and financial transparency are essential if commercial tenants and landlords are to find their way through this crisis.

Vivienne King, Chief Executive, Revo said:

Revo is pleased to support the government code of practice, which offers guidance to property owners and occupiers in navigating temporary rent arrangements through the pandemic, whilst underwriting the sanctity of existing contractual terms.

There are many cases of owners and occupiers collaboration in managing loss of income, which the code of practice reflects and we will continue to support government in identifying the potential measures to address this loss of income, which not only impacts owners and occupiers, but the wider economy including the savers and pensioners who depend upon it.

Paul Bagust, Global Property Standards Director, Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said:

We are pleased to have helped government in shaping this code which will increase constructive engagement and transparency between landlords and tenants at this challenging time. We believe it will provide a basis for negotiated measures which recognise the mutual importance and interdependence of landlords and tenants in contributing to the economy.

Kate Nicholls, CEO, UKHospitality said:

The near-total wipeout of income from the hospitality sector has left it unable to meet its rent obligations. This code goes some way to bringing together landlord and tenant in the pursuit of a negotiated solution to allow hospitality businesses to move on and revert to the new normal, but this must be recognised as a first step that needs to be built on by all parties.

We remain of the view that further time and support is needed to facilitate a recovery for the hospitality sector, that is at the heart of our social lives and communities. The extension of the moratorium on aggressive enforcement and forfeiture is a welcome measure to allow this process to take place.

After a primary course of AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, effectiveness against symptomatic disease appears to wear off with time. Overall, vaccine effectiveness against severe outcomes such as hospital admission remains high for several months after completing the primary course, but greater waning has been seen in older adults and those with underlying medical conditions compared to young, healthy adults. As a result, the JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) recommended a booster vaccine programme to eligible groups, including adults aged 50 years and above on 14 September 2021. This was extended to adults over 40 on 15 November 2021.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation atUKHSA, said:

Our findings demonstrate the protection provided by the booster dose against symptomatic infection in those at highest risk from developing severe COVID-19. We know that in older age groups, protection from the first 2 vaccines is beginning to wear off, leaving millions that need extra protection as we head into winter.

That is why it is critical that you come forward for your booster as soon as you become eligible so we can drive down hospitalisations and deaths over the winter.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/japanese-comedians-top-tips-for-fans-travelling-to-the-rugby-world-cup,Press release,Japanese comedian’s top tips for fans travelling to the Rugby World Cup,Comedian Yuriko Kotani is offering advice to help British fans avoid running into trouble in Japan during the Rugby World Cup.,Foreign & Commonwealth Office,8 August 2019,"Award-winning UK-based Japanese comedian Yuriko Kotani has teamed up with the Foreign & Commonwealth Office to produce some special advice for fans travelling to the Rugby World Cup in Japan this autumn.

Yuriko’s humorous tips are designed to help the 50,000 or more British fans expected to attend the tournament to support Wales, Scotland, England and Ireland to avoid pitfalls.

In a series of short videos the comedian uses her knowledge of both cultures to provide answers to some vital questions like: ‘do people sing and dance in public in Japan?’; ‘can I use my credit card?’; and should rugby fans ‘hug, bow or shake hands?’.

Here are Yuriko’s six top tips to help British rugby fans stay out of trouble in Japan:

Fans can find all our advice and guidance on theForeign Office Rugby World Cup Travel Advice page.

Travelling supporters can alsosign-up for email alertswhich will mean they receive essential updates straight into their inbox.

Yuriko Kotani, stand-up comedian, said:

I’ve been living in the UK for a while now and see the similarities as well as differences between Japan and the UK. I’m really excited to be part of this project.

I thought about what would be helpful to know before going to Japan especially for many of whom might never have been to Japan before, and I did my best to make the messages as fun as possible.

I hope that they are useful and everyone has a fantastic time at the Rugby World Cup in Japan!

Julia Longbottom, Director for Consular Services, Foreign & Commonwealth Office, said:

The Rugby World Cup in Japan provides an amazing opportunity for fans from England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales to explore Japan and experience a new culture.

Along with the basics of taking out travel insurance and looking after your passport, we know that doing some research into the culture of your travel destination can make all the difference when it comes to staying out of trouble.

In the last year, our consular teams around the world have helped over 20,000 British people from all four of the Home Nations when things have gone badly wrong.

We want all of our proud Welsh, Scottish, English and Irish supporters to have a safe trip, and to know that we will have teams on the ground at each Home Nation game to help anyone in difficulty.

British Ambassador to Japan, Paul Madden CMG, added:

As the British Ambassador I am privileged to have four teams to support; England, Scotland, Wales and together with the Irish Ambassador, Ireland, and I look forward to welcoming all Home Nation fans to Japan.

I know that the Rugby World Cup will be a huge success and the travelling fans will enjoy the fantastic Japanese hospitality.

We want to draw rugby fans’ attention to some of the differences in local laws and customs to ensure their trip is enjoyable and without incident. I’m really grateful to Yuriko Kotani, the comedian, for helping to get these messages across.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/latest-statistics-on-animal-research-published,Press release,Latest statistics on animal research published,The annual statistics on the use of animals in scientific research were published today by the Office for National Statistics. The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Division (ASPD) and Inspectorate (ASPI) have also published their joint annual report for 2009.,Home Office,27 July 2010,"Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals 2009, compiled from returns provided by 100 per cent of project licence holders, show:

Home Office Minister Lynne Featherstone said:

‘The figures released today highlight the important work being done in regulating animal research and testing in this country.

‘This government is committed to continuing with the highest standards of animal protection. We are also committed to ending the testing of household products on animals and to working to reduce the use of animals in scientific research, and work is currently underway to see how this can be achieved whilst maintaining the UK’s position as a leader in scientific advancement.

‘The UK already has one of the most rigorous systems in the world to ensure that animal research and testing is strictly regulated. We ensure procedures are only carried out where completely necessary, and that suffering is kept to an absolute minimum.’

The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Division (ASPD) and Inspectorate (ASPI) have also published theirjoint Annual Report for 2009. The report provides a collective account of the activities of the Home Office staff who regulate this work.

During 2009 the combined efforts of the division and inspectorate:

The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 regulates the use of animals in scientific experiments and ensures their use is limited to only where there is a clear potential benefit to either people, animals or the environment; and when there is no means of obtaining these benefits without animal use, or at a lesser animal welfare cost.

The ASPD operates the licensing system on behalf of the Secretary of State and provides policy advice and support, whilst the statutory role of the ASPI is to advise on proposals for work under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and to monitor compliance with authorities under that act.

All scientists and researchers undertaking animal research in the UK are required to take into account the ‘3Rs’ (measures to replace, reduce, and refine animal use) when devising their programmes of research proposals. Furthermore the Secretary of State may not authorise animal use when the scientific objectives can be met by means not using animals; and, when work is licensed, all reasonable steps must be taken to minimise the numbers of animals used and any suffering likely to be caused. The National Centre for the 3Rs provides a focal point and resources for such activities.

In November 2008 the European Commission published its proposal to revise Directive 86/609/EEC in order to strengthen and harmonise the regulation of the use of animals used in scientific experiments across Europe. The government continues to be actively involved in the ongoing negotiations on the revisions to the Directive."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/british-culture-and-history-at-heart-of-new-life-in-the-uk-test,News story,British culture and history at heart of new Life in the UK test,An updated Life in the UK test handbook that focuses on British culture and history will be released tomorrow.,Home Office and The Rt Hon Mark Harper,27 January 2013,"The new book is essential reading for candidates sitting the revised Life in the UK test, which is being introduced in March.

The new handbook and test are part of the government’s reforms to the immigration system to help reduce net migration to sustainable levels while ensuring that Britain continues to attract the brightest and the best migrants from across the world.

The Life in the UK test is taken by migrants wanting to settle permanently in the UK who already speak English to a sufficient standard.The test and handbook have been completely re-written, removing questions on topics that those living in the UK should already be aware of like public transport, credit cards and job interviews. Instead it focuses on British culture, history and traditions as well as the events and people who have helped make Britain a great place to live.

Minister for Immigration Mark Harper said: ‘We’ve stripped out mundane information about water meters, how to find train timetables, and using the internet. The new book rightly focuses on values and principles at the heart of being British. Instead of telling people how to claim benefits it encourages participation in British life.

‘We have made radical changes to the immigration system and are determined to reduce net migration from the hundred of thousands into the tens of thousands by the end of the Parliament. The latest figures show these reforms are working, with net migration falling by a quarter in the last year.’

In the past, historical information was included in the book but was not tested, meaning that migrants did not have to show they had an understanding of how modern Britain has evolved. The new book and test will focus on events and people who have contributed to making Britain great.

This includes writers like William Shakespeare and Robert Burns, the great scientists Isaac Newton and Alexander Fleming, engineers and industrialists like Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Richard Arkwright and politicians including Winston Churchill and Clement Attlee."

From 31 October local authorities will have the discretion to:

Figures reveal that almost half (44 per cent) of all violent crime is carried out by people under the influence of alcohol and 67 per cent of violent incidents occur in the evening.Minister for crime prevention Jeremy Browne said:

‘These measures are not about stopping responsible drinking but designed to tackle the minority who cause alcohol-related crime and disorder in our local communities.

‘It is reasonable to expect those profiting from the sale of alcohol to help pay the costs of policing, rather than expecting taxpayers to foot the entire bill.’

Both powers have been introduced as part of the police reform and social responsibility act 2011 and our estimates suggest that these measures could generate approximately £17m per year in England in Wales, with at least 70 per cent of that figure going to police and the remainder to local authorities.

Jeremy Browne added:

‘The new measures form part of the government’s alcohol strategy which aims to turn the tide against irresponsible drinking. Our plans include the introduction of a minimum unit price for alcohol and a ban on multi-buy promotions. We will consult on these measures later this autumn.’

Notes to editors:

1. An EMRO is an un-commenced power in the licensing act 2003 that will enable licensing authorities to restrict sales of alcohol in the whole or a part of their areas for any specified period between 12 midnight and 6 am, if they consider this appropriate for the promotion of the licensing objectives.

2. The late night levy will enable licensing authorities to raise a contribution from late-opening alcohol suppliers towards policing the night-time economy. It will be a local power which licensing authorities can choose whether or not to exercise. It must cover the whole of the licensing authority’s area. However, the licensing authority will also choose the period during which the levy applies every night, between midnight and 6am, and decide what exemptions and reductions should apply (if any) from a list set out in regulations.

Communities are also able for the first time to access information on offences of public disorder and possession of weapons, shoplifting, criminal damage and arson, theft and drugs recorded on every street.

This information on offence rates has been published as part of the government’s commitment to drive greater transparency across the criminal justice system.

Communities will be able to look up levels of crime and antisocial behaviour in their area which they can use to hold their local police, and in time their elected police and crime commissioner, to account in a meaningful way.

Minister for policing and justice Nick Herbert said: ‘Our crime mapping website,police.uk, has attracted phenomenal interest since its launch earlier this year with more than 430 million hits to date.  We want to build on this success and deliver a more transparent and accountable criminal justice system. The addition of further crime categories and easy access to police force performance data will give people the information and power they need to hold their local forces to account and ensure that crime in their area is driven down.’

Nick Herbert added: ‘Ahead of the introduction of elected police and crime commissioners, crime mapping is just one way in which the government is empowering communities and strengthening the link between the police and the public.’

The government is also working on a number of further improvements to the site which will be brought forward by the end of the year. These include:"

They include:

Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said:

The government is making a record investment to improve our motorways and major ‘A’ roads across the country to get motorists to their destinations more quickly, easily and safely.

These vital schemes in the East of England will not only help relieve congestion, they will also link people with jobs and businesses with customers, helping boost the region’s economy and improving lives.

Over the next few months public consultations will be held to give drivers, residents and businesses their chance to comment to ensure the best possible improvements are taken forward.

The schemes were announced in the government’sRoad Investment Strategyin December 2014 and are worth up to £1.1 billion in total.

Today’s announcement follows the start of works on the £1.5 billion A14 upgrade between Cambridge and Huntingdon and the government’s announcement to develop the Oxford to Cambridge expressway with £27 million of funding.

As part of the Autumn Statement in November 2016 a separate £1.2 billion was also announced that is available to councils across England to improve roads, relieve congestion and provide important upgrades to ensure our roads are fit for the future.

The first of consultation, due to start on Monday 23 January, will be about an upgrade on the A12 between Chelmsford and the A120 junction in Essex.

Highways England Chief Executive Jim O’Sullivan said:

These improvements are made possible by the Government’s £15 billion investment in our strategic roads.  They are much needed by the half a million drivers who use them every day.  Each scheme has been developed by working with local partners and through this consultation we are welcoming views on them.  I encourage anyone with an interest in these roads – whether they drive on them, live near them or depend on them for trade – to get involved.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dounreay-team-begins-to-empty-reactor-of-nuclear-material,News story,Dounreay team begins to empty reactor of nuclear material,Work is underway to retrieve the last remaining radioactive fuel elements that have been stuck for decades inside the iconic Dounreay Fast Reactor (DFR).,Dounreay,12 September 2017,"The experimental dome-shaped nuclear reactor once led the world in fast breeder technology and after it closed in 1977 most of the core fuel was removed. But work to remove elements from the breeder zone came to a halt when some were found to be swollen and jammed. Almost 1,000 – around two-thirds of the total – were left in place.

Decommissioning the 58-year-old reactor is one of the most technically challenging projects in the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) estate and removing the breeder elements has been a top priority.

Now, after many years of designing and testing remotely-operated equipment, a decommissioning team has started to recover the elements.

It is expected to take around three years to remove them all, after which work can begin on the final dismantling of the landmark reactor.

David Peattie, NDA Chief Executive, said:

“Dealing with this material is one of the highest priorities anywhere for the NDA, not just at Dounreay but across our UK sites. The safe and timely retrieval of the breeder material is crucial to both the site’s closure programme and the national defueling programme.  I am very pleased with this achievement which is a great example of how the Dounreay team and the NDA can work together to deliver results of national importance.”"
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/london-violence-arrests-have-been-made,News story,London violence: arrests have been made,Theresa May says that those responsible for violence will be made to face the consequences of their actions.,Home Office and The Rt Hon Theresa May,8 August 2011,"Police are continuing to respond to criminal activity across London, following riots in Tottenham on Saturday.

More than 100 people have been arrested after looting and violence broke out in a number of boroughs of north, east and south London overnight.

Speaking this morning, Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘Last night, police officers again put themselves in harm’s way to protect Londoners and their property.

‘Those responsible for the violence and looting will be made to face the consequences of their actions. Many have been arrested and further arrests will be made.

‘Londoners have made clear that there are no excuses for violence, and I call on all members of local communities to work constructively with the police to help them bring these criminals to justice.’"
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/police-reform-one-year-on,News story,Police reform: one year on,"A raft of measures will save an estimated 2.5 million police hours – the equivalent of 1,200 police officer posts a year.",Home Office and The Rt Hon Theresa May,9 May 2011,"At a major speech at Church House in London Theresa May told the audience of police officers: ‘These reforms are a watershed moment in policing, showing that we really mean business in busting bureaucracy and allowing police to police and not fill in forms.’

Read the speech in full.

Police should no longer expect police to be scrutinised by the Home Office or given top down targets she said.

Instead, they will be given the autonomy to manage themselves and be encouraged to come up will innovative ways to save time, money and cut crime.

Mrs May spoke about radical new time saving measures - for example, a process which allows police to inform defendants via post that they have been charged.

This will require the defendant to attend court on a specific date to answer the charge rather than calling the suspect back to the police station for charging. This would only happen in specific cases, she explained, but would save around 40,000 police officer hours annually.

Simplified crime recording process will also be championed, with forces encouraged to simplify their practices.

A review of crime statistics which is currently taking place could see the number of crime categories being reduced. This would reduce the amount of time spent filling out crime reports, saving around 95,000 hours of officer time each year.

And more efficient call handing processes, carried out by staff rather than police officers, should mean more efficient prioritising of incidents.

Meanwhile, a review by Sara Thornton, Thames Valley chief constable, is likely to see a reduction in the police service’s guidance by 2012.

This is likely to reduce current guidance from around 600 pieces of police guidance to fewer than 100, leading to significant savings for officers because they will no longer have to learn all of the guidance.

The Home Secretary congratulated chief constables in forces such as Avon and Somerset, Essex and Kent, and Hampshire and Thames Valley, who have achieved significant savings from outsourcing processes and sharing resources.

‘These are all examples of chief officers using their professional judgement to best deploy their resources in the fight against crime,’ she said."

Estimated net migration was 252,000 in the year to September 2011, compared to 255,000 in the year to September 2010.

The Home Office statistics also released today show more up to date figures and reveal significant reductions in the number of visas issued. These figures show that the reforms introduced by the government are starting to bite.

Immigration Minister Damian Green said: ‘Our tough new rules are now making a real difference with a record 62 per cent drop in student visas in the first quarter of 2012, and overall falls in work visas, family numbers and people settling.

‘As these policies start to bite we are seeing an end to the years when net migration was consistently on the rise. But the hangover from the old system of weak controls means it is still too high and we will continue our programme of reforms to bring net migration down from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands.’

The Home office figures also showed that:

The number of Tier 4 student visas issued has decreased by 62 per cent in Jan-March 2012, compared to Jan-March 2011. And for the year to March 2012 the number of student visas issued has decreased by 21 per cent compared to the year before.

Work visas are also down by 8% and family visas down by 16 per cent in the 12 months to March 2012, compared to the same period to March 2011.

The number of grants of extensions to stay has also fallen by 10 per cent for the year ending March 2012, compared to the year before.

Settlement also fell by a third in the year ending March 2012, compared with the previous 12 months

Today marks the 100th anniversary of International Women’s Day.

Key actions from the plan include:

Home Secretary Theresa May said: ’International Women’s Day is an excellent opportunity to highlight the many ways women are making a positive impact in this country and around the world. However more needs to be done to ensure that we provide the best possible start for future generations.

‘I want to see an end to all forms of violence against women and girls. Our comprehensive and detailed action plan sets out how we are going to tackle these crimes - supporting those at risk, helping victims and ensuring offenders are brought to justice.

‘Most importantly we need to prevent these crimes occurring in the first place. That is why we are challenging and where necessary working to change, attitudes and behaviours.’

Baroness Stern said: ‘I welcome the government’s response to the recommendations in my report. Particularly in a time of financial stringency it is good that the government recognises the importance of a specialist and supportive response to rape victims.’

The detailed action plan follows the Home Office’s announcement of £28 million of funding until 2015 for tackling violence against women and girls and the Ministry of Justice announcement of more than £10.5 million of funding for three years for rape crisis services.

The action plans focuses on four key areas: the prevention of violence including reducing repeat victimisation, the provision of support, the bringing together of groups to work in partnership and action to reduce risk by ensuring perpetrators are brought to justice.

1. To view the ‘Call to End Violence Against Women and Girls - Action Plan’ and the government response to the Stern Review visit theviolence against women and girlspages of this website.

2. Baroness Stern was commissioned in 2009 to conduct an independent review into how rape complaints are handled by public authorities. She was asked to consider how to encourage more victims to report rape, how to improve the response of the criminal justice system, the conviction rate, and how to build confidence and satisfaction in the handling of rape cases.

3. The British Crime Survey reports that every year more than one million women experience domestic abuse and one in four women will be affected by domestic abuse. More than 300,000 women are sexually assaulted and 60,000 women raped; and more than one in twenty women will be stalked."

It will also significantly downgrade the security status of the site once complete.

The NDA inherited a variety of nuclear fuels and materials when it took over responsibility for the legacy of the UK’s early atomic research, including approximately 100 tonnes at Dounreay.

It consulted on a strategy of ‘co-location’ of these materials at fewer sites and in summer 2011 announced its decision to remove approximately half of the inventory at Dounreay – the breeder from the Dounreay Fast Reactor.

The first of approximately 90 movements of this material from Dounreay to Sellafield by train took place in December 2012.

Now, following publication a year ago of options for the remainder of the stock at Dounreay, known as ‘exotics’, the NDA has announced these should also be transferred to Sellafield.

Transport arrangements have been identified in consultation with relevant authorities. The first moves are expected to commence around 2014/15 and continue for six years.

Alex Anderson, deputy project director for fuels and waste at Dounreay, said:

The NDA’s decision will allow us to refine the site closure plan and the vision of what the site will look like in 2022-25 when decommissioning is complete.

We will now work with Sellafield Sites Ltd and the NDA’s own transport companies to plan and implement this decision, obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and remove the last of the nuclear fuel from the site. The safety and security of this material will be paramount throughout."

Key recommendations include putting an end to:

Read the press notice here.

Control orders will be replaced with a more focused regime.

Legislation to introduce the regime will be put before Parliament in the coming weeks.

There will also be increased efforts to deport foreign nationals involved in terrorist activities in this country, while fully respecting human rights.

Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘The threat from terrorism remains serious and complex and I have always said that this government’s first priority is to protect public safety and national security.

‘But for too long the balance between security and British freedoms has not been the right one.‘The measures we are announcing today will restore our civil liberties while still allowing the police and security services to protect us.

‘They are in keeping with British traditions and our commitment to the rule of law. I also believe they will restore public confidence in counter-terrorism legislation.’

The counter-terrorism review was launched in July last year and was asked to look at the issues of security and civil liberties in relation to the most sensitive and controversial security powers.

The aim was to ensure that the powers and measures were necessary, effective, and proportionate, while meeting the UK’s international and domestic human rights obligations.

TheOffice for National Statisticsfound that over the same period, employment for non-UK nationals was 2.64 million, up 75,000 on the previous year. This represents an increase of 2.9 per cent compared to a 6.8 per cent rise between 2010 and 2011.

Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: ‘These figures show we are building a better immigration system that works in the national interest and is supporting growth. The rise in numbers in employment has benefitted British citizens first, but our system is still allowing skilled migrants to come to the UK where they are needed by British businesses.‘This follows significant changes to the immigration rules, clamping down on bogus students who only came to the UK to work, often in low skilled jobs, while remaining open to the brightest and the best.‘We have also seen falls in net migration and the number of visas issued is at its lowest since 2005. We will continue to work hard to ensure net migration is reduced from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands by the end of this Parliament.’

Of the extra people in work over the last year, nearly nine out of ten are British. The figures show there are more people in work than ever before, with the number of people in employment rising by 154,000 to 29.7 million. All of the increase was in full-time work. The UK employment rate is now higher than in the United States and is well above that in the Eurozone."

Today’s announcements build on the largest pay rise in nearly a decade for over a million public sector workers last year, which included a multi-year deal for NHS nurses.

Prime Minister, Theresa May, said:

Whether it’s keeping us safe, saving lives or educating the next generation, our public sector workers deserve this pay rise in recognition of the brilliant job they do on a daily basis.

In 2017 we ended the public sector pay cap and I’m pleased that we can build on this today by giving almost a million of our dedicated public servants an above inflation salary increase.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, said:

Public sector workers deliver Britain’s world class public services and should be properly rewarded which is why I’m confirming a second year of above inflation pay rises today.

This is in recognition of the hard work of millions of people, including soldiers, teachers and doctors, and will help us recruit and retain the best staff.

We are able to afford these pay rises because our balanced approach means we have reduced our debt while investing in public services, including pay.

Each workforce is different and reaches its own settlement with the government. All six deals finalised today hand pay rises higher than the current 2% rate of inflation (CPI June 2019, ONS) for the 2019/20 financial year.

The pay rises will be backdated to the start of each work force’s financial year and mean a rise of 2.75% for school teachers, 2.5% for consultants and dentists, 2.5% for police officers, 2.9% per cent for personnel in the Armed Forces, at least 2.2% for Prison Officers and 2% for senior Civil Servants and senior military staff.

Pay for most public sector workers also rose above inflation last year after the Government ended the across-the-board 1% pay rise cap in September 2017. Earnings growth for public sector workers reached 3.6% last year.

Around a quarter of all public spending goes on pay. In 2018/19, the Government spent £190.95 billion on pay, up from £171.59 billion in 2015/16.

Independent pay review body recommendations for teachers, consultants and dentists, police officers, prison officers and the Armed Forces are being accepted and announced in full today."

The Home Secretary and lead Home Office minister Lynne Featherstone were joined by representatives of charities Missing People and Parents and Abducted Children Together (PACT), and also Child Exploitation and Online Protection (CEOP), who marked the event with the launch of new advertisements for the MissingKids website on London taxis.

Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘Missing children are vulnerable and deserve the best support and protection we can provide.

‘We in government have played our part with our Missing Children and Adults Strategy, which sets the direction for local services. And on last year’s International Missing Children’s Day we announced that we were strengthening our response by moving operational responsibility for missing children to CEOP from 1 July last year.

‘I am delighted that, a year on, we are able to support the launch of the new MissingKids website in partnership with PACT, as well as Missing People’s new 116 000 helpline. Both services will bring much needed support to those most in need of help.’

Home Secretary Theresa May was among those who addressed the group about progress made since the government transferred responsibility for missing children to CEOP last July.

These new tools are part of that progress and are in direct response to the government strategy on missing people, launched last December.

The confidential helpline, provided by charity Missing People, is a 24 hour support service which missing children and their families can call or text to get access to advice and support.

The website provides the latest information on missing children, for missing children and for parents or carers of missing children. It has been created jointly by CEOP, PACT and Missing People."

This joint initiative between the government and Companies House will mean businesses can prioritise managing the impact of Coronavirus.

There are approximately 4.3 million businesses on the Companies House register, and all companies must submit their accounts and reports each year. Under normal circumstances, companies that file accounts late are issued with an automatic penalty.

As part of the agreed measures, while companies will still have to apply for the 3-month extension to be granted, those citing issues aroundCOVID-19will be automatically and immediately granted an extension. Applications can be made through a fast-tracked online system which will take just 15 minutes to complete.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma said:

We have outlined a business support package on an unprecedented scale, backing companies and their employees through these challenging times.

But it is important that our support is not limited to financial assistance. We are determined to help businesses in any way we can, so that they can focus all their efforts on dealing with the impact of Coronavirus, and this new offer of a 3 month extension for filing accounts is part of that.

Companies House Chief Executive, Louise Smyth said:

We recognise that these are uncertain times for businesses and that’s why we’re doing all we can to help.

By easing the burden, we can help businesses through this period and enable them to thrive in the future. I would encourage companies who believe they would benefit from this new flexibility to make an application in good time.

Head of Corporate Governance, Institute of Directors, Roger Barker said:

These measures will be welcomed by directors impacted byCOVID-19. Our members will be pleased to see government taking proactive steps to support them through this difficult time. By easing the administrative burden that comes with running a business, the government is supporting businesses to focus on the fundamentals during this exceptional period.

The government is also in close consultation with company representative bodies, legal practitioners and others, to look at solutions for the impactCOVID-19may have on companies’ ability to hold Annual General Meetings. Updated guidance on this matter will be published in due course."

You should wash your hands for 20 seconds, using soap and water or hand sanitiser.

You should also cough or sneeze into tissues before binning them.

The campaign will appear in the print media, radio, online and in public places, including billboards.

It has been brought forward in response to the current global situation.

Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said:

The UK is a world-leader in preparing for and managing disease outbreaks and I have every confidence in our nation’s ability to respond to the threat of COVID-19.

We all have a role to play in stopping this disease and that’s what this expanded campaign is all about – making sure the public knows exactly what they should be doing to keep themselves and others safe. Washing hands regularly is the single most important thing that an individual can do.

Public safety remains our top priority. The government and the NHS are working 24/7 to fight this virus. It’s imperative that everyone follows clinical advice by contacting NHS 111, and not going to A&E if you develop symptoms.

The first phase of the campaign began in February 2020, in response to the rising number of confirmed cases of coronavirus globally and in the UK.

On 3 March the Prime Minister published acoronavirus action planfor the UK, which sets out plans for a range of situations.

Since January, public health teams and world-leading scientists have been working continuously on the coronavirus response.

The NHS, Public Health England (PHE) and local authority public health across the country are working hard to support everyone in need of advice, testing or treatment.

The government has been working with partners across the country to provide advice to the public, travellers coming into the country and those most at risk from COVID-19.

PHEhas already got the results of more than 13,000 tests, and all but 51 have been negative.Latest figuresare published daily.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/consultation-launched-on-doubling-maximum-sentence-for-assaulting-an-emergency-worker,Press release,Consultation launched on doubling maximum sentence for assaulting an emergency worker,"Anyone who assaults or attacks emergency workers could face longer jail terms, as a consultation on doubling the maximum penalty for the offence is launched today.",Ministry of Justice,13 July 2020,"Consultation seeks views on increasing maximum penalty from 12 months to two years in prison

Ministers deliver on manifesto commitment to consult on tougher sentences

Maximum sentence could be doubled for the second time in two years

In 2018 this Government changed the law (Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Act 2018) so that anyone found guilty of assaulting a police officer, firefighter, prison officer or paramedic faced a maximum of 12 months in prison. Judges must also consider tougher sentences for more serious offences – such as GBH or sexual assault –  if the victim was an emergency worker.

Now the Government is seeking views from stakeholders, including representative bodies from the emergency services and the judiciary, on whether the maximum penalty should be doubled to two years behind bars.

It delivers on a manifesto commitment to consult on tougher sentences, with ministers determined to recognise the debt of gratitude the public feels towards our emergency workers –  for the courage, commitment and dedication they show every day in carrying out their duties, including during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Justice Secretary & Lord Chancellor, Rt Hon Robert Buckland QC MP, said:

Being punched, kicked or spat at should never be part of the job for our valiant emergency workers who put their lives on the line to keep the public safe.

Now more than ever they must be able to do their extraordinary work without the fear of being attacked or assaulted, which is why we’re determined to look at how our laws can protect them further.

We will continue to do everything in our power to protect our police, prison officers, firefighters and paramedics - and ensure those who seek to harm them feel the full force of the law.

Home Secretary, Rt Hon Priti Patel MP, said:

Our police officers, firefighters and other emergency workers go above and beyond every single day – running towards danger to protect us all.

They are our frontline heroes who put their lives on the line every single day to keep us safe, and yet some despicable individuals still think it’s acceptable to attack, cough or spit at these courageous public servants.

This consultation sends a clear and simple message to the vile thugs who assault our emergency workers – you will not get away with such appalling behaviour and you will be subject to the force of the law.

The consultation will run for four weeks and, depending on the response to the consultation, legislation could be brought forward – which would see the maximum sentence for assaulting an emergency worker doubled for the second time in two years.

Assault can cover acts such as a push, shove or being spat at. When an emergency worker is seriously injured, prosecutions will take place under more serious offences such as ABH, GBH, or attempted murder that have far longer sentences.

The CMA is launching a market study into housebuilding, and will start a separate consumer protection project related to rented accommodation.

The market study comes following concerns builders are not delivering the homes people need at sufficient scale or speed. The CMA’s consumer protection work will seek to shed light on the experience of renters and explore whether more could be done to help landlords and intermediaries to understand their obligations.

Sarah Cardell, Chief Executive of the CMA, said:

The quality and cost of housing is one of the biggest issues facing the country. Over the last few years, the CMA delivered real change for leaseholders, with tens of thousands of homeowners receiving refunds after being overcharged unfair ground rents.

With that work nearly finished, we’re now looking to probe in more detail two further areas – the housebuilding and the rental sectors.

If there are competition issues holding back housebuilding in Britain then we need to find them. But we also need to be realistic that more competition alone won’t unlock a housebuilding boom.

In the same vein, we want to explore the experiences people have of the rental sector and whether there are issues here that the CMA can help with.

We will of course be guided by the evidence, but if we find competition or consumer protection concerns we are prepared to take the steps necessary to address them.

The CMA’s market study into housebuilding will focus on 4 areas:

A market study allows the CMA to use compulsory information-gathering powers to probe the entire market. As well as helping develop a deeper understanding of how and when housebuilders decide to deliver new homes and the interaction of that with local authority housing targets, the study will consider the issues faced by smaller, regional firms.

More information can be found on thehousebuilding market studycase page.

The CMA’s consumer enforcement work in housing will focus on:

Following a period of targeted stakeholder engagement across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the CMA will report on its initial findings and proposed next steps this summer.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hundreds-of-thousands-of-women-experiencing-menopause-symptoms-to-get-cheaper-hormone-replacement-therapy,Press release,Hundreds of thousands of women experiencing menopause symptoms to get cheaper HRT,"Around 400,000 women across England will get better access to menopause support - saving hundreds of pounds and making treatment more accessible.","Department of Health and Social Care, Maria Caulfield and The Rt Hon Steve Barclay MP",21 February 2023,"From 1 April 2023, women prescribedHRT- the main treatment for menopause symptoms - will have access to a new scheme enabling access to a year’s worth of menopause prescription items for the cost of 2 single prescription charges (currently £18.70).

As part of commitments to reduce the cost ofHRTfor menopausal women, thePPCwill be valid for 12 months. It can be used against alist ofHRTprescription items, and a patient can use this against an unlimited number ofHRTitems, such as patches, tablets and topical preparations. There will be no limit to how many times the certificate can be used while it is valid.

Reducing the cost ofHRTis just one of the steps being taken by the government to improve access toHRT, alongside continuing work with suppliers to encourage and support them to boost supply to meet growing demand.

The introduction of the certificate delivers one of our year 1 priorities for theWomen’s Health Strategy for England. Published last summer, the strategy sets out an ambitious new agenda for improving the health and wellbeing of women and girls and to improve how the health and care system listens to women. Menopause was announced as a priority area within the strategy.

Health and Social Care Secretary Steve Barclay said:

This new certificate will makeHRTmore accessible than ever before - helping around 400,000 women save hundreds of pounds a year.

This is another step in our drive to improve support for millions of women experiencing the menopause, delivering on our Women’s Health Strategy.

Minister for Women, Maria Caufield, said:

Around three-quarters of women will experience menopause symptoms, with a quarter experiencing severe symptoms - which can seriously impact their quality of life.

Reducing the cost ofHRTis a huge moment for improving women’s health in this country, and I am proud to be announcing this momentous step forward.

In our Women’s Health Strategy, we made menopause a top priority. By makingHRTmore accessible, we’re delivering on our commitment to women.

Women’s Health Ambassador, Dame Lesley Regan, said:

The menopause is an inevitable stage in a woman’s life course. As a gynaecologist, I’ve witnessed first-hand the symptoms that women experience, which can have debilitating impacts on their daily lives.

MakingHRTmore affordable will have a hugely beneficial impact on the lives of so many women. This prepayment certificate is a major step forward in prioritising the health and wellbeing of women.

Around 15% of women aged 45 to 64 in England are currently prescribedHRT, which has increased rapidly in the last 2 years from around 11% and continues to increase.

The government has accepted the recommendations of theHRTTaskforce, including encouraging and supporting manufacturers to boost supply to meet growing demand and continuing to issue serious shortage protocols (SSPs) when needed to even out distribution. This involved allowing alternative products to be dispensed when necessary, and reducing the need for the patient to return to their GP.

The department engages with suppliers on a weekly basis, closely monitors the supply ofHRT, and regularly meets with individual suppliers, including hosting quarterly roundtables with industry to ensure a continuous supply ofHRT.

Women will need to apply for thePPCthrough the NHS Business Services Authority or in person at a pharmacy registered to sellPPCs. Once it has been granted, it will be available for use immediately on or after 1 April 2023. When collectingHRTproducts, patients will be able to simply show the digital or paper copyHRTPPCto the pharmacist and complete the exemption declaration on the NHS prescription form.

Dr Ranee Thakar, President of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said:

We know that cost can be one of the barriers that women face in accessing treatment to manage their symptoms during menopause, and the introduction ofHRTPPCsis a positive step to improve access toHRT. This announcement is an important first step, and we hope that more will be done to address the challenges and inequalities faced in accessing menopause care and treatment.

Dr Janet Barter, President of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, said:

We welcome the introduction ofHRTPPCsby the Department of Health and Social Care. This is a big step towards improving women’s access to menopause treatment in England and reducing inequalities in access to this essential healthcare. Improved access toHRTwill improve the lives of millions of women, allowing them to easily take control of their own menopause.

Janet Lindsay, CEO of Wellbeing of Women, said:

HRTis a first line treatment for women who may need help with managing menopause symptoms which can be debilitating. Improving access toHRT, by reducing the prescription costs, is absolutely the right thing to do and will help to empower women during this life stage.

TheHRTPPCis in addition to the existing help with prescription charges, including the3 and 12 monthPPCs.

For people who need multiple medicines, the existingPPCsmay remain a more cost effective method of paying for prescriptions.

The red list and quarantine system remain vital in protecting our borders and as we’ve said we will not hesitate to take action by adding countries to the red list if necessary.

The government keeps its border measures under review, including the red list, and will impose restrictions should there be a need to do so to protect public health.

TheWHOEULProcedure was brought in during the 2014 Ebola outbreak to assess vaccines for use and to support countries in accessing vaccines (and other selected products) during public health emergencies.

“With more young people than ever before looking to start their own business, Start Up loans will provide the support they need to help get their business ideas off the ground.

“The scheme is not just about money. They will also get access to professional mentors who will pass on their knowledge and expertise about running successful enterprises. Money is going out of the door now, so those who want to take advantage should apply today.”

The scheme is being led by the newly formedStart-Up Loans Company, led by entrepreneur James Caan. So far 1,200 people have registered an interest in applying for a loan.

James Caan said:

“Start-Up Loans are exactly what young people need to get them on their way to launching their own businesses.

“Through the Start-Up Loans Company, we are encouraging young people to be more entrepreneurial by taking their future into their own hands and creating their own opportunities.”

The latest list of service providers that will work alongside Start-Up Loans Company have also been announced today. They include:

This year the Government is running theBusiness in You campaignto inspire more people to start or grow their business backed by a range of existing business support services provided by the public and private sectors.

The Business Secretary was in Yorkshire to celebrate the positive impact that entrepreneurs and SMEs have on the economy. Following the MADE festival he will visit Gripple, a growing business in Sheffield that produces wire joining and tensioning devices used in the agriculture and construction sectors. He also met young entrepreneurs from Gripple’s ‘Incub’ project, an ideas incubator aimed at helping budding entrepreneurs fast-track their concepts to market.

Since the launch of the original product in 1988 more than 300 million devices have been sold across 75 countries. The company has also been growing by 15 per cent each year.

Vince Cable said:

“Businesses like Gripple are exactly the kind of enterprises that will help boost our economy - hi-tech, highly skilled with an impressive export record.

“Sheffield is a hotbed for these kinds of success stories. The Yorkshire region has a wide range of growing businesses, particularly in the manufacturing sector, and we want to see more.”"

This will give thousands of children the opportunity to learn leadership skills, volunteer in their communities and build their self-confidence.

Over the next three years, the new cadet units will be created through partnerships with existing units in schools or by creating completely new units. The £10.85m will go towards essential equipment and training of staff.

Interested schools will simply need to demonstrate they are able to provide the adult volunteers and third-party funding to maintain the unit.

Research has found that cadets tend to have high levels of respect for authority and high levels of self-esteem. They are likely to be committed citizens, with high aspirations and a greater sense of community. The vast majority, nearly 80 per cent, said being a cadet has helped them stay out of trouble.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said:

Cadet Forces offer a great opportunity to gain life skills and we are determined to ensure that we open that opportunity up to as many young people as possible.

The funding announced by the Government today will kick-start an exciting new phase in the development of our Cadet Forces - fostering greater social mobility and raising awareness of the values and ethos of our Armed Forces among local communities.

Education Secretary Michael Gove said:

Cadet Forces provide an exciting and challenging way for young people to learn teamwork, self-discipline and respect. They have made a hugely positive impact, especially in boosting standards and discipline.

By extending the scheme in state schools, more young people can benefit from the cadet experience. It will help them develop into well-rounded, accomplished adults fully-prepared for life beyond school.

We know many schools with Cadet Forces have a partnership or collaboration arrangements with neighbouring schools to allow more young people to take part. We want to see more partnerships to allow schools to share their expertise and facilities for the benefit of all.

Interested schools can apply before 30 September 2012 via the Department for Education website - see Related Links.

There are four major MOD-sponsored Cadet Forces: the school-based Combined Cadet Force and the community-based Sea Cadet Corps, Army Cadet Force and Air Training Corps.

Between them our 26,000 adult volunteers deliver life-changing training to some 140,000 young people a year. There are currently 3,280 cadet units across all four Cadet Forces in the UK, 324 of which are in state schools.

The first of the 100 new units has already been organised and is being funded by the charitable side of the Honourable Artillery Company, a historic Territorial Army unit in the City of London. It will be based at the City of London Academy - Islington and will be formed in September 2012.

The four Cadet Forces are military-themed youth organisations (not Junior Armed Forces) with a strong emphasis on social inclusion. They are subject to government legislation and do not have the legal exemptions enjoyed by the Armed Forces.

Cadets follow a structured syllabus and many gain externally-recognised qualifications like St John Ambulance first aid certificates, Duke of Edinburgh’s Awards (Bronze, Silver and Gold), and vocational qualifications in public service and music.

Popular activities vary across the different Cadet Forces but include climbing, flying (powered and glider), sailing, power-boating, target-shooting, fieldcraft, overseas expeditions, community work and diving.

Priority will be given to schools and academies with a ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ Ofsted (Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills) rating with a high rate of ‘free school meal pupils’, but this will be balanced by MOD’s ability to support extra units in that area.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/education-secretary-michael-gove-announces-review-of-14-to-19-vocational-education,Press release,Education Secretary Michael Gove announces review of 14 to 19 vocational education,"Education Secretary Michael Gove announces review of 14 to 19 vocational education, to be carried out by Professor Alison Wolf.",Department for Education and The Rt Hon Michael Gove,9 September 2010,"Education Secretary Michael Gove today announced a major independent review of vocational education for 14- to 19-year-olds, which is to be led by Professor Alison Wolf of King’s College London.

Mr Gove said that for too long vocational qualifications had not been properly valued and that a gap had been left in the country’s skills base as a result.

Professor Wolf will look at the organisation of vocational education and its responsiveness to a changing labour market, and consider ways to increase incentives for young people to participate. The review will also take explicit account of good practice in a selection of developed economies.

Professor Wolf will examine

She is due to submit a final report in spring 2011, which will include recommendations on how vocational education can be improved.

Michael Gove, who today announced the review in a speech to the independent education foundation, Edge, said:

For many years our education system has failed properly to value practical education, choosing to give far greater emphasis to purely academic achievements. This has left a gap in the country’s skills base and, as a result, a shortage of appropriately trained and educated young people to fulfil the needs of our employers. To help support our economic recovery, we need to ensure this position does not continue and that in future we are able to meet the needs of our labour market.

To enable us to achieve this long-term aim, we are currently developing a new approach to qualifications, considering all routes which are available to young people, to ensure the qualifications they study for are rigorous, relevant and bear comparison with the best in the world.

Professor Wolf is highly experienced in this field and has all the credentials required to lead this review.

Professor Wolf said:

Our current arrangements for 14-19 education are highly bureaucratic and inflexible. They also make it very difficult to encourage excellence in anything which is not conventionally academic: writing about people doing things gets rewarded more than actually doing them.

Rigid systems are particularly undesirable at a time when the labour market and the economy are in a state of constant change. We need to make it possible for vocational education, and educators, to respond easily to the real requirements of the labour market. I hope this review will identify principles and institutions which promote this and help all young people to progress in the world of work, throughout their lives.

Lord Baker, the Chairman of Edge, said:

We welcome this review; it is high time that we are able to ensure that all young people have both choice and quality in their education allowing them to pursue their own individual path to success. This start must include high-level vocational courses, ones that are taught to high standards in high class institutions. One such example is the university technical colleges, which will recruit young people at 14 and allow them to study a highly regarded, technically oriented course in a specialist college. We look forward to seeing the results of the review and playing our part in changing the educational landscape for the better.

Professor Wolf will conduct a public call for evidence, which will be made by the end of September.

Professor Wolf is the Sir Roy Griffiths Professor of Public Sector Management at King’s College London. She specialises in the relationship between education and the labour market, and has particular interests in training and skills policy, and universities. She has been a specialist adviser to the House of Commons select committee on education and skills; is the Council Member for the UK on the Council of the United Nations University; writes widely for the national press and is a presenter for Analysis on BBC Radio 4.

Edge is an independent education foundation dedicated to raising the stature of practical and vocational learning. Its chairman is Lord Baker, who held a number of senior positions in Margaret Thatcher’s Government, including Secretary of State for Education and Science when he introduced the National Curriculum, city technology colleges and grant-maintained schools. He became a member of the House of Lords in 1997. As co-founder of the Baker Dearing Educational Trust, Lord Baker is leading the introduction of university technical colleges. He firmly believes that it is vital for our young people and our economy that students should have access to high-quality education combining academic, practical and vocational learning.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ex-service-personnel-to-become-mentors-to-young-people,News story,Ex-service personnel to become mentors to young people,Ex-service personnel will be fast-tracked into schools to help young people achieve.,"Department for Education, The Rt Hon Liam Fox and The Rt Hon Michael Gove",28 February 2011,"Former members of the armed forces will become mentors to young people in schools across England following a £1.5 million grant to the charitySkillForce, Education Secretary Michael Gove announced today.

Through three pilot programmes, ex-service personnel will be fast-tracked into schools, using the skills and experience gained on the frontline to help young people achieve. SkillForce will be funded to set up the three programmes from September 2011:

Military to Mentors: 100 ex-service personnel will be trained to work as mentors for young people in and out of schools across England. SkillForce will work alongside two other organisations – Endeavour and the Knowsley Skills Academy on this programme.

Zero Exclusion Pilot: SkillForce will provide intensive support to 100 young people at risk of exclusion from school. This will take place in five regions across England (areas to be confirmed), over a 12 month period.

Expand SkillForce Core Programme: investing in the existing SkillForce programme that uses teams of instructors from military backgrounds to work with disadvantaged young people, helping them gain qualifications. Over a year, the charity will support 340 additional young people from parts of the country with high unemployment and deprivation.  Part of this will include elements of the Zero Exclusion pilot.

Michael Gove, Secretary of State for Education, said:

There is a huge opportunity for those people who have served their country in uniform to serve their country in our schools. They have many of the virtues that parents across the country feel have disappeared from our schools and need to be restored: self-discipline, a sense of purpose and a belief in the importance of working as a team.

That is why I want to offer people leaving our Armed Forces an opportunity to enter the classroom, and I am delighted to support SkillForce in doing so.  Ex-Service personnel will act as inspiring role models for the next generation. They will help to instil in young people, often from some of the most disadvantaged backgrounds, discipline, self-respect and a sense of purpose.

Peter Cross, Chief Executive of SkillForce, said:

SkillForce is delighted to be asked to expand its work with disadvantaged young people. Our programmes effect positive and permanent change in their lives as evidenced by 60 per cent on Free School Meals going into Further Education compared with nine per cent nationally. The use of former military mentors enables them to serve their communities following a first career of service to their country.

Dr Liam Fox, Secretary of State for Defence said:

The men and women who have served in Britain’s Armed Forces have a great deal to offer their local communities. The SkillForce programme is a great example of Big Society in action and will allow former Service personnel to make a real difference to young peoples’ lives. At the core of our Armed Forces are the values central to a successful society such as loyalty, self discipline and motivation. I am certain that the nation’s children will thrive under the mentorship of these courageous individuals.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-reveals-plans-to-improve-disabled-people-s-lives,Press release,Government reveals plans to improve disabled people's lives,New plans to improve the lives of disabled people have been set out by the Government today (Tuesday 18 July).,Department for Work and Pensions and Disability Unit,18 July 2023,"Immediate and practical measures proposed in the fully accessible consultation include ensuring businesses are aware of disabled people’s needs – including Guide Dog access needs – to allow all disabled people to live, work and shop freely and support for local authorities to ensure the playgrounds they build or refurbish are accessible for disabled children.

The proposals will inform the Government’s Disability Action Plan later this year, laying the foundations for longer term change.

Other measures in the proposed Plan include:
- Raising the profile of assistive technology to ensure more disabled people have access to life-changing tech
- Legislating for mandatory disability awareness training for taxi and private hire drivers to unlock greater travel freedom for disabled people
- Encouraging more autism-friendly programmes in the cultural and heritage sectors to drive greater inclusivity 
- Improving reasonable adjustments in the courts system so more disabled people can be on juries improving diversity and breadth of experience 
- Implementing the British Sign Language (BSL) GCSE, over a year after theBSLAct was introduced, giving thousands of pupils communication and visual memory skills that will be an advantage to them for the rest of their lives 
- Exploring the feasibility of Great Britain hosting the Special Olympics World Summer Games in 2031.

The Disability Action Plan sits alongside the Government’s National Disability Strategy which sets out our longer-term vision to improve disabled people’s lives for the better.

Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work, Tom Pursglove MP, said:

Our Disability Action Plan will lay out practical measures we can implement here and now to improve the lives of disabled people.

From leading the way globally with assistive technology to improving inclusivity and accessibility across sport, travel and culture, the Plan will also be important in setting the stage for longer term change.

We want disabled people to be at the heart of decision making and I would encourage anyone interested to respond to this consultation so the views of disabled people across the country are front and centre of our final Disability Action Plan.

The Plan builds on the Government’s achievements over the last year on education, work, leisure, and rights for disabled people. This includes supporting the passage of landmark legislation: the Down Syndrome Act and British Sign Language (BSL) Act – and a consultation to support the introduction of a newBSLGCSE.

The overarching focus on disability has also ensured over 2,000 miles of King Charles III England Coast Path is accessible, while the government has delivered an additional £1 billion for the education of children and young people with more complex needs.

The consultation will run for 12 weeks and be open for anyone to comment. This will ensure the Plan is informed by the experience and views of disabled people, disability organisations and charities as well as other interested parties.

Chair of the Disability Unit West Midlands Regional Stakeholder Network, Louise Mckiernan said:

I welcome the Government’s commitment to their new Disability Action Plan and their intention to take immediate and practical actions to improve the lives of disabled people across the UK.

The launch of this consultation is an important opportunity for disabled people in particular to have their say and to help shape the Government’s short-term plans.

I would encourage as many disabled people, disability organisations and other interested parties as possible to take part in this consultation exercise to ensure their voices are heard.

I would like to thank Dr Ian Craig, the Chief Schools Adjudicator, for his annual report, which raises a number of important issues.

It is absolutely right that every parent should want their child to go to an excellent school, so school admissions will continue to be a controversial and sensitive issue as long as there are too few good school places.

I am committed to driving up educational standards so all parents have that choice of high-quality schools close to home, which is why we are encouraging providers to set up new schools and turning round under-performing schools. And so no child is disadvantaged because of their background, I am introducing the pupil premium.

I also intend to make the school admissions framework, including the School Admissions Code, simpler and fairer, and I have asked my officials to start speaking with key stakeholders.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/michael-gove-announces-review-of-key-stage-2-testing,News story,Michael Gove announces review of key stage 2 testing,The Education Secretary appoints Lord Bew to review assessment and accountability procedures.,Department for Education and The Rt Hon Michael Gove,5 November 2010,"Education Secretary Michael Gove today appointed the cross-bench peer, Lord Bew, to chair the external review into Key Stage 2 testing, assessment and accountability.

Lord Bew will lead a small review panel consisting of two education experts, a number of primary headteachers and one secondary school head. The panel is due to launch a 12-week call for evidence, following which it will publish a progress report summarising the evidence gathered. The panel will publish its final report by June 2011.

The review will look at a number of issues, including:

Education Secretary Michael Gove has acknowledged the current system can be improved to ensure concerns - such as children being ‘drilled’ at the expense of broad learning - are overcome while the information parents want is still provided.

Michael Gove said:

We know parents support clear, rigorous and transparent testing at the end of primary school, and the OECD has concluded that external accountability is a key driver of improvement in education and particularly important for the least advantaged. So we must continue to allow parents to know how their local primary schools are performing.

Raising standards and narrowing gaps are the central goals of the Government’s education policy. It is not our intention that the accountability system should be punitive or unfair to schools working in difficult circumstances but it must be able to identify and tackle cases of sustained underperformance.

Equally, I recognise concerns from heads and teachers about the current system. That is why I have ordered a review - to see whether there is a better way to give parents the information they want and hold schools to account, while overcoming the concerns.

I am delighted that Lord Bew, a hugely experienced, cross-bench peer, has agreed to lead the review, and I look forward to considering the panel’s findings next year.

The Education Secretary also announced today new arrangements for delivering National Curriculum tests and assessments following the abolition of the QCDA. Working within the Department, an executive agency will oversee statutory tests and assessments for children up to age 14. Its exact remit will be confirmed following consideration of the recommendations of Lord Bew’s review.

Michael Gove said:

It is essential that the statutory assessment arrangements put in place following our review are delivered in a timely and effective way. It is right that accountability for ensuring this rests with ministers, and that is why I am establishing an executive agency within my department that will be accountable to me for the secure delivery of its functions.

As the independent regulator, Ofqual will continue to have an important role, as it does now, in keeping under review the agency’s functions relating to National Curriculum tests and assessments.

Mr Booker is completely wrong to suggestin his article (13 February 2011)that I have taken no interest in the issues he raised at our private meeting, that he first publicised, not me. I spoke at length with him about his concerns, and have been pursuing ways of introducing more effective safeguards within the Department for Education and with the head of the court system, Sir Nicholas Wall.

What I said to Mr Booker at our meeting is that his campaign, based on a limited number of worrying cases, is undermining and misrepresenting the entire care system and adoption in general. This is deeply damaging to hard-working professionals protecting our most vulnerable children, and to those children who desperately need a stable family.

I am the first to admit there are issues that need to be addressed - that is why we are carrying out independent reviews of both the family justice and child protection systems.

Sensationalist stories about exceptional cases distort the reality of the thousands of children waiting in care for a loving, stable home with adoptive families, and the thousands for whom adoption has been a lifesaver.

The current qualification - the National Professional Qualification for Headship (NPQH) - is to be overhauled to allow prospective head teachers from all types of schools the chance to develop the best skills for the job.

All first-time headteachers in the maintained sector are currently required to hold the NPQH. As signalled in the Schools White Paper ‘The Importance of Teaching’, the National College was asked to review the qualification to ensure it matches the best in the world, learns from other leading qualifications such as MBAs, meets the highest standards for leadership development and is based on what is required to be an effective head teacher.

In the light of the review, Ministers have today announced that:

Schools Minister Nick Gibb said:

The highest-performing education systems are those where government knows when to step back and let heads get on with running their schools.

Our reforms are centred on giving great head teachers the skills they need and the professional autonomy to make a difference to thousands of young lives.

We want to create a qualification for those about to become head teachers that will help them develop the key skills needed to take on this challenging and rewarding role. It will start them on the journey to becoming outstanding lead professionals. We also want to ensure the NPQH remains a highly regarded and sought-after qualification.

Steve Munby, Chief Executive at the National College, said:

Raising the bar will help to drive up the standard of school leadership in this country even further.

The current NPQH is already highly regarded and sought-after but, in a rapidly changing education sector that is becoming increasingly diverse and autonomous, no qualification can stand still.

We believe the new non mandatory NPQH will be ranked alongside the best leadership development in the world and become the mark of quality that governing bodies and academy boards choose to rely on when appointing head teachers and principals, as only the most talented candidates will get through.

The NPQH was introduced in 1997 to prepare those keen to become head teachers. In 2008, the qualification was revised to target those within 12 to 18 months of becoming a head teacher and then became mandatory in 2009 for all first-time head teachers working in the maintained sector.

To date, around 35,000 have graduated with the qualification and just over half - around 58 per cent - of current heads in maintained schools hold the NPQH.

The National College, working with key stakeholders including existing head teachers, will revise the content of the new NPQH:

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/bailey-review-of-the-commercialisation-and-sexualisation-of-childhood-final-report-published,Press release,Bailey Review of the Commercialisation and Sexualisation of Childhood: final report published,Report recommends clampdown on sexualised ‘wallpaper’ surrounding children.,"Department for Education, Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (2018 to 2021), Sarah Teather and Ed Vaizey",6 June 2011,"A six-month independent review into the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood, which reports today, calls on businesses and media to play their part in ending the drift towards an increasingly sexualised ‘wallpaper’ that surrounds children.

Reg Bailey, Chief Executive of Mothers’ Union, who led the independent review, has listened to parents’ concerns about the barriers they face in bringing up their children. They are particularly unhappy with the increasingly sexualised culture surrounding their children, which they feel they have no control over. They singled out sexually explicit music videos, outdoor adverts that contain sexualised images, and the amount of sexual content in family programmes on TV.

Reg Bailey’s recommendations are based on parents’ concerns and are intended to support them, make sure their views are taken more seriously by businesses and broadcasters, and help children understand the potential dangers they face. They will put control back in the hands of families.

The recommendations include:

Reg Bailey said:

Society has become increasingly full of sexualised imagery. This has created a wallpaper to children’s lives. Parents feel there is no escape and no clear space where children can be children.

I want to put the power back in parents’ hands so they can better manage the pressures on their children and make it easier for them to bring up their children the way they want.

Parents need encouragement to feel they can change things and that their voices will be heard. Regulators, businesses and broadcasters should do more to connect with parents - it’s not enough for them to work out what is acceptable from what people complain about afterwards. I hope that they see that it’s good business if you look out for families. Then we can all help to make Britain a more family friendly place.

Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said:

I’m very grateful to Reg for his insightful and thorough review, and for recommending a set of practical measures to help parents protect their children in the increasingly sexual and commercial world we live in.

It is not government’s role to interfere in family life. But parents often tell me that they would like more support so that they can navigate the rapidly-changing technological and commercial world. Reg’s review shows the way for business and government to give them this support.

I know that Reg has encountered a lot of goodwill from the broadcast, retail and advertising industries throughout his review. I am looking forward to working together to implement his proposals.

Ed Vaizey, Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries, said:

We know that many parents are concerned that their children could be exposed to content that seems too adult, be it online, on TV, through adverts or in music videos. I welcome the collaborative way that regulators and industry have engaged with Reg Bailey. For our part, we are committed to consulting on whether age ratings on music videos would provide effective protection for children.

Many of the actions suggested in the report are for businesses and regulators rather than for the government. Reg Bailey is recommending that the government should monitor the implementation of his recommendations and do a stock-take in 18 months’ time. To make sure that good progress is made quickly, the prime minister and children’s minister will invite a wide range of businesses and regulators into Downing Street in October and ask them to report on steps they have taken to address the issues raised in this report.

The British Retail Consortium (BRC) has today published new family-friendly guidelines which Mr Bailey welcomes as a clear example of how industry can respond positively and voluntarily to public feeling. He recommends all retailers should sign up to the guidelines.

Jane Bevis, Director of Public Affairs at the BRC, said:

This has been an important review in considering the needs of children and families in an increasingly complex world. We have been delighted to work closely with Reg and his team as they have examined some real and challenging issues and debunked a number of urban myths.

It has highlighted the excellent practice already in place in responsible retailers - and the need to share this more widely so that parents can be confident when shopping.

Our good practice guidelines on childrenswear, launched alongside Reg’s report today, aim to ensure that the highest standards are maintained across the sector.

Guy Parker, Chief Executive of the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), said:

The protection of children from harmful or inappropriate advertising is one of the Advertising Standards Authority’s top priorities and to do this we know we need to reflect the views of parents and young people in our work.

We welcome Reg Bailey’s recommendations on advertising and we’re committed to making sure that parents have the confidence to raise their concerns and to know that they’ll be heard.

Chris Woolard, Group Director of Content at Ofcom, said:

Protection of children is one of Ofcom’s most important statutory duties and we therefore welcome Reg Bailey’s review of this significant area.

Ofcom recognises the critical importance of parents’ views about what children watch on TV. We will continue to focus on exploring parents’ views in our enforcement of broadcasting standards relating to the protection of children.

The Bailey review listened to the views of parents, children and young people through a range of ways including face-to-face surveys, a call for evidence and focus groups. The Office of the Children’s Commissioner for England also submitted the views of 552 children and young people, published in a report today.

TheBailey Review of Commercialisation and Sexualisation of Childhood - Letting Children be Children, was published on Monday 6 June 2011.

Reg Bailey was asked to lead the independent review on 6 December 2010.

Contributions to the review included:
* 1000 parents completed an online call for evidence.
* 1025 parents of five to 16-year-olds and 520 children and young people aged seven to 16 took part in a face-to-face survey.
* 70 parents took part in qualitative research, including focus groups.
* 552 children and young people took part in a survey by the Office of the Children’s Commissioner for England.
* 120 organisations and businesses submitted written evidence.
* Over 40 organisations and experts held individual meetings with Reg Bailey.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/department-for-education-responds-to-criticisms-of-clauses-within-the-education-bill,News story,Department for Education responds to criticisms of clauses within the Education Bill,The DfE responds to concerns from the National Secular Society about protection of staff in faith schools converting to academy status.,Department for Education,18 February 2011,"Responding to a letter from the National Secular Society to the Secretary of State, shared with the media, about the protection of non-religious staff in faith schools, a Department for Education spokeswoman said:

We are disappointed with the misleading claims from the National Secular Society (NSS). The clause highlighted by the NSS is in fact there to ensure that the statutory rights of staff are protected when a school converts to Academy status.

The Education Bill does not reduce protections for teachers within faith schools that convert into Academies and we are confident that the Bill does not breach any domestic or European law.

A combination of provisions within the Bill, the Academies Act Commencement Order, Funding Agreements and the Equalities legislation provide protection for teachers when schools convert to academy status.

If, as can only happen with the agreement of the Secretary of State, an academy later changes from a model similar to voluntary-controlled to voluntary-aided teachers will be protected through a transitional provision. There have been six such conversions in the since 2007.

Where a voluntary controlled or foundation school with religious character converts to Academy status, clause 58 of the Education Bill continues the protection of non-reserved teachers that existed before the conversion. The protection is afforded to such schools in the meantime by way of transitional provisions in the Academies Act 2010 (Commencement and Transitional Provisions) Order 2010. Therefore it is not right to say that teachers in such schools are not currently protected if their schools convert to Academy status. The position of future staff is also protected in the funding agreement.

After conversion, it is possible for such an Academy to change its governance arrangements so that they reflect the maintained school voluntary aided model, in the same way that it is possible for a voluntary controlled or foundation school in the maintained sector to become a voluntary aided school. In practice this is rare - there have been 75 incidences of conversion from VC to VA model over the last 10 years.

Just as that process requires consultation in the maintained sector, we would expect any Academy wishing to make such a change to set out their business case fully and ensure a wide and thorough consultation was carried out. The Secretary of State would only approve an amendment to the Funding Agreement or the Memorandum and Articles  if he was satisfied that sufficient consultation had taken place in the case of such a change and that the responses to the consultation showed that such a change was supported. If the Secretary of State agreed to change the governance arrangements of an Academy a deed of variation would be needed to make these amendments.

The Bill enables the Secretary of State to make an Order to disapply new section 124AA of the 1998 Act in the case of such a change, which would mean that section 124A of the 1998 Act would apply so that the school could lawfully discriminate in respect of up to 100% of its teachers on religious grounds. However, any Order made would include transitional provisions to continue the protection of existing non-reserved teachers. In the case of any change of category from voluntary controlled to voluntary aided in the maintained sector, it is secondary legislation that provides for the protection of non-reserved teachers, not primary legislation (The School Organisation (Prescribed Alterations) Regulations 2007, paragraph 55 of Schedule 3). Therefore, we do not see any need to put this on the face of primary legislation.

The protections afforded to staff at community and secular voluntary and foundation maintained schools against discrimination on grounds of religious opinions etc. in current legislation are not applied to independent schools. Academies have existed since 2000 and we are not aware that this issue has been a problem in practice in this time. We are content to rely on the general Equality legislation in respect of such teachers.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/childrens-minister-launches-a-charter-for-children-in-foster-care,Press release,Children's Minister launches a charter for children in foster care,Tim Loughton aims to dispel myths surrounding foster care to give children in the care system the same opportunities as their peers.,Department for Education and Tim Loughton,18 March 2011,"Children’s Minister Tim Loughton will today put an end to the persistent myths and red tape around fostering that have undermined foster carers for too long, in a new Foster Carers’ Charter published today.

Currently, many foster carers and children in care are facing obstacles to everyday activities, like going for haircuts and sleepovers, which can make children’s lives more difficult and put off those wanting to foster. The new Charter sets out clear principles on how foster carers should be treated, recognises their invaluable work and aims to encourage more people to sign up to be foster carers.

In particular, the Charter is designed to:

The Charter is backed up by new slimmed-down fostering regulations and guidance, published last week, which make clear to local authority fostering services what their statutory duties are and reduces unnecessary burdens placed on them.

The number of children coming into care has risen in recent years. There are currently 64,400 being looked after in England - over 70 per cent of these children are looked after by foster families. With a shortage of suitable foster families, the Government is clear that the status and experience of fostering needs to improve so more people will come forward to foster and will carry on doing so.

The Charter has been jointly produced by Government, fostering organisations, charities and young children. It is part of the Government’s wider programme of reform to improve the entire care system - including reducing barriers and delays to adoption and improving the quality of children’s homes. The overall aim is to make sure that all children in care have greater stability, less upheaval and a better chance at a stable family life.

Children’s Minister Tim Loughton said:

Foster carers are the unsung heroes of our care system. They do a fantastic, selfless job helping often vulnerable children build stable relationships that can endure into adulthood. Too often I hear stories about foster parents feeling isolated, unsupported, and facing endless red tape when all they are trying to do is enjoy everyday activities with their foster child - like taking them on holiday or even for a haircut.

The new Charter will help to change that. It underlines the huge value we place on foster carers. Not only as role models to the children who look up to them, but also as pushy parents who put those children first. The Charter sets out clear principles of what support should be available and what foster carers can expect.

I hope every local authority and fostering agency will sign up to the Charter. I particularly want local areas to sign up to the spirit of the Charter and build on and develop it in their own way to reflect the needs of the local community.

Listening to young people’s views is central to this Government’s vision for improving the care system. To help support this, the Department is also today launching a new web tool, Tell Tim, where young people in care, those who have left care or those working in the care system, can send their thoughts, ideas and experiences direct to Children’s Minister Tim Loughton.

Both the Charter and Tell Tim represent a new approach to inclusive, responsive Government. The Minister wants to hear about what works and what doesn’t and what changes the Government should be considering to make the system better. The Minister will also continue to hold regular quarterly meetings with groups of children in care and separately with care leavers.

The revised fostering guidance published last week:

In addition, the Government has invited local authorities to bid for funding to provide intensive support to looked after children with complex needs - including those on the edge of care. LAs are invited to bid for between £50,000 and £200,000 to run the following programmes: Multi-dimensional Treatment Foster Care (MTFC), Keeping Foster and Kinship Carers Safe and Supported (KEEP) for looked after children, Multi Systemic Therapy (MST) for children on the edge of care or custody and Functional Family Therapy (FFT) for young people with conduct and offending behaviour.

Robert Tapsfield, Chief Executive of the Fostering Network, said:

We welcome the Government’s new Foster Care Charter and its continued support for fostering. Foster carers must always be regarded as equal members of the team working with a child and they need the full support of their fostering service. A Charter that is agreed by fostering services and their foster carers will help to make this a reality. We will be working with fostering services as they put this Charter into practice, so that foster carers get the recognition they deserve and need to provide children with the best possible care.

Peter Liver, Director of ChildLine, said:

We have seen a 30 per cent increase in fostered and other looked-after children contacting ChildLine over the past five years.  They have often been through extremely traumatic experiences and are among the most vulnerable children in society.

For the first time, Tell Tim will give all looked-after children a way to speak directly to government and policy-makers, the people who can influence the quality of their lives in care. We are pleased to see the government opening up this channel of communication and its commitment to listening to these children.

Dr Roger Morgan, Children’s Rights Director said:

I welcome what this Charter says. A Charter must first make sense, and then must happen. This one makes sense to children - the Minister has put a lot of what they told him they wanted into it. Next, what it says must actually happen and then be monitored.

David Holmes, Chief Executive of BAAF said:

The role foster carers play in supporting some of our most vulnerable children should not be underestimated. Put simply, they transform children’s lives. BAAF welcomes the Foster Carers’ Charter as a helpful addition to existing legislation and guidance.  We hope that it will encourage and support existing foster carers and lead directly to the recruitment of new carers.

David Oldham, CEO of Foster Care Associates said:

As the leading independent foster care agency, Foster Care Associates (FCA) fully supports the Foster Carers’ Charter and welcomes the positive impact this will generate not least of all for foster carers but for those involved in all aspects of fostering. As part of the Steering Group, FCA believes the Charter is an important step forward in raising the bar to achieve positive outcomes for looked after children and young people as well as recognising the vital role our foster carers undertake. In today’s tough economic climate the need to support vulnerable children is ever more important.

Harvey Gallagher, Chief Executive of the Nationwide Association of Fostering Providers (NAPF) said:

Foster carers are the amazing people who care for children and young people when things get tough. Independent and voluntary sector fostering providers understand the huge contribution that their carers make to the lives of children in care, often children with the most complex and challenging needs. But it is the support we give to foster carers that enables them to play their part; it is what enables them to provide stability and calm for children who have often had very chaotic lives.

Children need foster carers to be there for them 24/7, and we have to be there for foster carers, whenever they need us. NAFP embraces this Charter. We will be taking its message out to all our foster carers, and anyone thinking about becoming a foster carer, so that we can be sure they know how much we value what they do for children.

Kevin Williams, Chief Executive of The Adolescent and Children’s Trust (TACT), said:

TACT welcomes the Foster Carers’ Charter as an important step in raising awareness of the importance of foster care and of the support that carers and the children they look after are entitled to. Local authorities signing the Charter will need to ensure that cuts do not affect the standards that are expected of them.

John Kemis, Chief Executive of Voice said:

Voice welcomes the launch of the Foster Carers’ Charter. Foster carers are so important to give children in care a family home and the care and stability they need. They deserve all the recognition and support we can give. The Charter will complement the Children’s Pledge that every local authority should now have for all the children they look after.

Andrew Christie, from the Association of Directors of Children’s Services (ADCS) said:

The Foster Carers’ Charter reminds us that carers are at the heart of any plan for the child in their care, that they should be involved in decision making and be clear about the support available to them. The Charter provides a clear and easily understandable set of principles to guide the relationship between foster carers and the local authority in providing for the needs of some of the most vulnerable children.

Jane  Haywood, Chief Executive at the Children’s Workforce Development Council (CWDC), said:

Foster carers play a unique role and rarely get the level of recognition they deserve. This charter will help to emphasize the importance of making sure foster carers are supported so that they can then be confident in fulfilling their role and responsibilities and can get access to the right learning and development, to enable them to have a positive impact on the experiences of the children and young people in their care.

This Charter is a great opportunity to reinforce the importance of building strong partnerships around children and young people in care. We believe it will provide a forum at the local level for services to be more proactive and include foster carers in planning for stability and quality in placements.

Children and young people in care have told us how important it is for them to feel that their foster carers are supported and valued to help them to make the most of their lives. They also tell us they want the people who work with them to share information and work together.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/schools-minister-nick-gibb-responds-to-key-stage-2-attainment-statistics,News story,Schools Minister Nick Gibb responds to key stage 2 attainment statistics,"Gibb: ""We want to raise academic standards for all young people and to close the attainment gap.""",Department for Education and The Rt Hon Nick Gibb,9 December 2010,"Nick Gibb has today commented onstatistics showing key stage 2 attainment by pupil characteristics.

Schools Minister Nick Gibb said:

These figures reveal that our education system is letting down half of all 10- and 11-year-old boys who qualify for free school meals. It is not acceptable that at the end of primary school these children are still not reaching the standard in English and maths they need to flourish at secondary school. After 7 years of primary school, children need to be fluent in these basic skills which is why the government is putting such an emphasis on improving pupils’ reading ability in the first years of primary school, with a focus on phonics.

It is also why we are giving such a priority to raising standards of behaviour in schools and supporting teachers and headteachers in their effort to instil a zero-tolerance approach to poor behaviour and low level disruption in class.

We want to raise academic standards for all young people and to close the attainment gap between those from poorer and wealthier backgrounds, so starkly demonstrated by today’s figures.

The Statistical First Release showing the key stage 2 results broken down by pupil characteristics are available on the DfE’s data, research and statistics website.

Just over 4,000 schools - 26% - did not administer the tests this year. In all about 420,000 pupils took the tests, and results were returned to schools on time on 6 July 2010. As well as national results, statistics for key stage 2 tests are published for government regions and local authorities. The Department’s Head of Profession for Statistics has confirmed that today’s results are representative of the national picture and comparable to previous years. The results for 20 local authorities have not been published as it was considered that the schools that took part were unrepresentative of the profile of schools in the area as a whole.

Science was not included in the national curriculum tests this year. Instead a 5% sample of schools took science sampling tests to estimate national attainment in the subject. National results for this were published on 10 August 2010.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/fair-funding-for-all-schools,Press release,Fair funding for all schools,Headteachers today welcomed a 2-part government consultation seeking views on how school funding can be made fairer.,Department for Education and The Rt Hon Lord Hill of Oareford CBE,13 April 2012,"Headteachers today welcomed a government consultation on how school funding can be made fairer.

It seeks the views of parents, teachers, schools, unions and local authorities about the current system, and asks whether a new system would result in a fairer outcome for schools.

The consultation launched today is the first part of a two-stage process. Taking into account these views, further proposals will be published for consultation later this year.

As it stands, the school funding system creates large variations in how much money similar schools in different parts of the country receive. Funding is based on historic calculations - some dating back to at least 2005 - that bear little resemblance to the needs of schools and their pupils today.

For example:

Ministers believe this is unfair, which is why the government is consulting on whether we should try to make school funding fairer.

Ideally a new funding system for all schools would:

More than £35 billion of revenue is spent on schools each year. It is crucial that the funding system provides good value for money and that resources are distributed fairly.

The consultation asks questions including:

Schools Minister Lord Hill said:

Headteachers tell us that the current funding system is unfair and illogical. In some cases it means a child living in one part of the country can be funded up to £1,800 more than a child with similar needs living elsewhere. Having a fairer system is not just right in principle. It would enable parents to see more clearly how schools are doing with the funding they receive.

Addressing the disparities and inequalities within our school system is a top priority for the coalition government. For standards to improve, all pupils must get the support they are entitled to. This consultation is the first step to ensuring fairer funding for all.

Brian Lightman, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said:

ASCL has long argued for a reform of the funding system and the development of a new funding system. We are therefore very pleased to see that the government is launching this consultation.

What we have known for some time, and was obvious following the department’s release of financial data on schools in January, is that the current funding method is inequitable and indefensible. Funding between similar secondary schools can vary by up to £1,000 per pupil; this situation surely cannot be allowed to continue. A continuation of the current ‘spend plus’ methodology would actually increase the level of unfairness in school funding, making this review absolutely essential.

Implementation of a change of this magnitude will need to be very carefully planned and we welcome the opportunity to contribute to this consultation.

Russell Hobby, General Secretary of the NAHT, said:

The time is right for a debate on a new funding system. The significant differences in funding between schools of the same size and intake cannot be justified and the current system is far too complicated. Funding must be consistent across schools if accountability is to be fair. We are under no illusions about the challenge and risk, especially in times of financial constraint, but it is a conversation worth having.

The early framework for consultation asks many of the right questions and suggests some workable principles. As an association, we endorse the need to recognise the differing characteristics of pupils and for simplicity and transparency. School leaders must be able to plan over the long term.

We need to think carefully about how we protect small schools that are so clearly valued by their communities, how we avoid turbulence and how we manage any transition.

These are the early days of a very long run process and we welcome the commitment to a genuine dialogue from first principles.

The government is also consulting on potential options for funding academies next year, as an immediate step towards making the funding system simpler. This consultation will run for 6 weeks.

At present, academy funding replicates the funding that other schools in the local authority receive. But this system was designed for a much smaller number of academies. As more schools choose to convert, the current system is becoming increasingly clumsy and needs to change. 629 academies are now open, compared to 203 in May 2010.

The current academy funding system has a number of flaws:

The Government is consulting on three different options for funding Academies in the school year 2012 to 2013.

David Wootton, Chair of the Independent Academies Association, said:

We in the academy movement are committed to a funding formula that is fair for all schools and all children. The present system is innately unfair and has for a long time disadvantaged many youngsters. The funding system has not kept up with the pace of change or indeed changes in localities.

A new funding system has the potential to create a fairer and simpler way of funding schools. This consultation offers everyone the chance to explore and consider in some detail the opportunities and challenges in moving from the current highly complex arrangements to a simpler, transparent system.

The intention to consult on the benefits of a new funding system was set out in the Schools white paper.

The report says that the best education systems around the world

These are the very policies we are taking forward in our white paper, learning from the best of what works from around the world and applying it here.

Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove said:

Today’s PISA report underlines the urgent need to reform our school system. We need to learn from the best-performing countries.

Other regions and nations have succeeded in closing the gap and in raising attainment for all students at the same time. They have made opportunity more equal, democratised access to knowledge and placed an uncompromising emphasis on higher standards all at the same time. These regions and nations - from Alberta to Singapore, Finland to Hong Kong, Harlem to South Korea - should be our inspiration.

While each of these exemplars has their own unique and individual approach to aspects of education, their successful systems all share certain common features. Many have put in place comprehensive plans for school improvement which involve improving teacher quality, granting greater autonomy to the front line, modernising curricula, making schools more accountable to their communities, harnessing detailed performance data and encouraging professional collaboration. It is only through such whole-system reform that education can be transformed to make our nation one of the world’s top performers.

England has continued to fall in the PISA rankings, meaning that in just nine years we have dropped from 7th to 25th in reading, 8th to 27th in mathematics and 4th to 16th in science. We have been overtaken by countries such as Poland, Iceland and Norway. This is despite England spending far more on education than comparable nations such as Germany.

And the report worryingly shows that England has relatively high numbers of low-performing pupils compared to countries like Australia, Canada and Finland. We are also less successful at overcoming the effects of social background than countries such as Canada and Japan, meaning that the poorest children in England are up to 2 full years behind their wealthier peers.

Schools minister Nick Gibb added:

I’m concerned that almost 40% of pupils in England never read for enjoyment. The difference in reading ability between these pupils and those who read for 30 minutes per day was equivalent to a year’s schooling.

By far the most popular activities recorded for our 15-year-olds involved communication either through email or online chat. Of course this has its place and it’s good that our young people have these skills in the computer age, but we cannot allow our youngsters to neglect the basic hobby of picking up a book and reading it simply for the enjoyment of it.

We need to reform English. The great tradition of our literature should be at the heart of school life. Our literature is the best in the world and we should be proud if it. But thousands of children - including some of our very brightest - leave school unable to compose a proper sentence, ignorant of basic grammar, incapable of writing a clear and accurate letter. We will change this as an absolute priority.

The most striking high performer is the newcomer to PISA, Shanghai China, which tops the tables across all three subjects. Their pupils are a full two-and-half years ahead of ours in mathematics.

OECD PISA 2009 results

PISA 2009: achievement of 15-year-olds in England

The full report, including a UK note, can be found on the OECD website. Further details on England’s performance in the assessments can be found on the NFER website.

OECD PISA has taken place every three years since 2000. It assesses the knowledge and skills of pupils coming towards the end of compulsory schooling (Year 11 equivalent) in reading, mathematics and science, using specially developed tests. Participating pupils also complete a background questionnaire which yields data about their socio-economic background, study habits and attitudes to reading, while headteachers complete a questionnaire about their schools.

PISA 2009 focused on reading. The study was carried out in England on behalf of the Department by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER). A total of 4,081 pupils across 165 schools in England participated, including independent schools and academies in proportion to their numbers nationally.

The headline results for England are:

2009:Reading: 18% are below level 2Mathematics:  20.2% are below level 2Science: 15% are below level 2

This compares in reading to:Finland     8.1%Canada    10.3%Korea        5.8%

In 2006 (England):Reading: 18.9% were below level 2Mathematics: 19.9% were below level 2Science: 16.7% were below level 2.

From the UK briefing note, para 76:

Effective school systems require the right combination of trained and talented personnel, adequate educational resources and facilities, and motivated students ready to learn. But performance on international comparisons cannot simply be tied to money, since only 7 OECD countries spend more per student than the United Kingdom. Among the successful PISA countries, Canada, Finland and Shanghai-China invest the money where the challenges are greatest rather than making the resources that schools get a function of the wealth of the local communities in which schools are located, and they put in place incentives and support systems that attract the most talented school teachers into the most difficult classrooms.

Vol IV, p106

The bottom line is that the quality of a school system cannot exceed the quality of its teachers.

Have clear standards, high expectations, and external exams

Vol IV, p105

In countries where schools have greater autonomy over what is taught and how students are assessed, students tend to perform better.

…schools that enjoy greater autonomy in resource allocation tend to do better than those with less autonomy.

From the UK briefing note under, para 30:

Results from PISA suggest that, across OECD countries, schools and countries where students work in a climate characterised by high performance expectations and the readiness to invest effort, good teacher-student relations, and high teacher morale tend to achieve better results, on average across countries.

From Vol 1V, p104/105

Setting standards and showing student how to meet them matters.

Most high-performing countries have developed world-class academic standards for their students and almost all have incorporated those standards into a system of external examinations that are used to construct clear paths into the workforce and good jobs or to the next stage of education or both. Indeed, PISA shows that the existence of such external examinations is positively associated with overall performance of school systems.

From the UK briefing note, para 57

Many of the successful countries have developed elaborate support systems to foster the motivation of the full diversity of students to become independent and lifelong learners. They tend to train teachers to be better at diagnosing learning issues so that they can address them by personalised instruction methods. Second, they help individual teachers to become aware of specific weaknesses in their own practices, which often means not just creating awareness of what they do but also changing the underlying mindset. Third, they then seek to provide their teachers with an understanding of specific best practices and, last but not least, motivate them to make the necessary changes with instruments that go well beyond material incentives.

From Vol 1V, p105

Autonomy matters when combined with Accountability

Within countries where schools are held to account for their results through posting achievement data publicly, schools that enjoy greater autonomy in resource allocation tend to do better than those with less autonomy.  However, in countries where there are no such accountability arrangements, the reverse is true.

In countries that use standards-based external examinations, students tend to do better overall.

Nick Gibb emphasises the government’s commitment to tackling the causes of absenteeism.,Department for Education and The Rt Hon Nick Gibb,26 August 2010,"Latest statistics for spring term 2010 show a decrease in overall absence rates in both primary and secondary schools compared to spring term 2009. This follows decreases in spring 2008 and spring 2009.

Authorised absence rates decreased in both primary and secondary schools. Unauthorised absence rates increased in primary schools and decreased in secondary schools.

Schools minister Nick Gibb said:

The small fall in the overall absence rate in all schools, and in unauthorised absence in secondary schools, in spring term 2010 is very welcome, but the level of absenteeism in schools is still too high.

The Government has committed to tackling the underlying causes of absenteeism, raising academic standards and ensuring every child can meet their potential, regardless of their background. It’s crucial that children are not missing out on valuable lessons that could leave them vulnerable to falling behind. We are putting in place a series of measure to raise standards of behaviour, to put head teachers and teachers back in control of the classroom, and to get tougher on parents and pupils who do not abide by the rules.

We are also introducing the first ever pupil premium to provide additional funding for more disadvantaged pupils so that they benefit from the same opportunities as their more affluent peers. We need to ensure that all pupils have the basic skills of reading, writing and maths before they reach secondary school.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/free-schools-55-to-open-this-month-twice-as-many-as-this-time-last-year,Press release,Free schools: 55 to open this month – twice as many as this time last year,Fifty-five new free schools will open in September 2012. They will raise standards and increase choice for parents.,Department for Education and The Rt Hon Michael Gove,3 September 2012,"The government has today announced that 55 new free schools will open this September. The first 24 free schools opened in September 2011 while a further 114 have been approved to open in 2013 and beyond.

Free schools aim to achieve higher standards and offer a genuine alternative. They are funded by the government but have greater freedoms than local authority-run schools. They are run by teachers - not local councils or Westminster politicians - and have freedom over the length of the school day and term, the curriculum and how they spend their money.

The schools opening this month include:

Of the new free schools opening this September:

Education Secretary Michael Gove said:

Every child should have the choice to go to an excellent local school. These new schools have been set up by idealistic people who are determined to give parents the kind of choice that only the rich can currently afford. The first 24 free schools are enormously popular and I expect this second wave to be equally successful.

Liam Nolan, executive head teacher of Perry Beeches II, Birmingham, said:

This is a fabulous opportunity for us to expand our brand of success into a new community and to work with a new group of young people in the heart of Birmingham. This is one of the beauties of free schools, that the very best schools can extend their outstanding practice.

Marina Gutierrez, Chair of the Bilingual Primary School Trust, Brighton, said:

I am delighted that this project has now become a reality and that Brighton & Hove’s children will have bilingualism as an educational choice.

Free schools have proved hugely popular with parents. All 24 which opened last year have filled, or almost filled, all their places for this year. Many have expanded to meet demand and many have large waiting lists.

New York charter schools, one of the inspirations behind free schools, have been shown to substantially narrow the attainment gap between rich and poor - by 86% in maths and 66% in English. In Chicago they halve the achievement gap between inner-city students and their wealthier suburban counterparts.

In England academies, which have the same freedoms as free schools, improve at a faster rate to state secondary schools - between 2010 and 2011 the proportion of pupils achieving five or more GCSEs at A* to C including English and maths rose by 5.7 per cent in academies, compared to 3.1 per cent in state secondary schools.

This press notice relates to England only.

Groups that were successful in applying to open a Free School went through a robust process to make sure they were suitable and capable to run a school. They had to:
* provide evidence of demand for the particular new local school they wanted to set up;
 * set out in detail the curriculum the school would offer, the type of teachers it would recruit, and how the school would run its pupil admissions to make sure they are fair;
* develop robust plans for how the school planned to run its finances (which then were scrutinised to make sure the school was financially viable);
* secure an appropriate site for the school that provided value for money for the taxpayer; and
* be CRB checked and undergo in-depth vetting by the Department’s Due Diligence Unit.

Like other state-funded schools, free schools are inspected by Ofsted, will have their exam and test results published and will have to teach a broad and balanced curriculum. Action will be taken if results slip or if teaching isn’t up to scratch. Free schools also have to abide by the same rules for pupil admissions as other schools - making sure that these are fair and inclusive of children from different backgrounds.

Applications to open free schools in 2014 (or later) must be submitted to the Department for Education between Monday 17 December 2012 and Friday 4 January 2013.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pupil-premium-awards-celebrate-schools-helping-disadvantaged-pupils,Press release,Pupil Premium Awards celebrate schools helping disadvantaged pupils,"Headteachers and deputy heads from schools across the UK came to Admiralty House, London, today to receive Pupil Premium Awards.","Deputy Prime Minister's Office, Department for Education and The Rt Hon Nick Clegg",8 July 2013,"The Deputy Prime Minister made the awards to schools for their work helping disadvantaged pupils get on and improve by innovative use of the pupil premium.

Winning schools took home cash rewards of up to £10,000, in recognition of the way they have pioneered the use of the pupil premium - a £900 payment to schools for every pupil who is eligible for free school meals - to help those children reach their potential and reduce educational inequalities. Today’s awards ceremony was a chance to showcase the work they do so other schools across the country can learn from their impressive results.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said:

We’ve got to do everything we can to reduce the inequalities in our education system. I’m determined to help pupils who start school behind other children in their class to catch up. Everyone deserves the chance to do well and get on in life.

Since April we’ve been investing £900 in each and every one of those pupils. School leaders and teachers are the frontline professionals working hard to come up with ideas to make a real difference to them, so it’s great that we are recognising what works best.

From the south west to the north east, the judges were impressed with the work schools are doing. The pupil premium is giving children and young people the best possible start in life, so that when they finish their education they can go for the jobs they have always dreamed of.

There were 3 overall winners - 1 primary school, 1 secondary school and a special school. There was also a runner-up in each category, each taking home £3,000. The schools will be able to spend their prizes however they want to.

TES worked closely with the Department for Education and Deputy Prime Minister’s Office to design the awards so that schools that had made a measurable difference in educational attainment were short-listed and recognised for their achievements. TES chief executive, Louise Rogers, presented the awards with the Deputy Prime Minister.

The national winners were Longford Park School in Stretford in the special school category, Pakeman Primary School in Islington, and Westminster Academy in London in the secondary school category. These schools are exemplifying how the pupil premium can be used to give all schoolchildren the start they need in life.

Longford Park used the pupil premium to invest in new IT, put on extra art classes and introduce new therapies. They also bought new music equipment and established a brass band which competes against mainstream schools.

Pakeman Primary School used the pupil premium to provide more support for reading and to employ intensive one-to-one teachers for intensive learning.

The Westminster Academy has seen most of its pupils massively improve, performing significantly above the national average for all students getting 5 A* to C grades including English and maths at GCSE. They used their pupil premium to invest in small group teaching, especially in English and maths.

The runners up were:

The Prime Minister said:

“British SMEs are already doing incredible things, but we urgently need more of them to follow that boldness. We need this to be a country where more people think ‘I can start my own business and I can sell to the world.

“Our determination is to come through these difficult times stronger, to trade our way to growth and jobs. We need to show real optimism about the future, and we need to show real aggression about pursuing Britain’s interests in the world. The markets are there to be tapped; the deals are there to be done, the opportunities are there to be capitalised on. Now together we must seize them.”

Business Secretary Vince Cable said:

“Today, not only are we able to announce substantial new measures to support businesses, but also to see the commitment of private sector firms and organisations to tackling the economic challenges we face. We want to reach and help the 80 per cent of SMEs who don’t seek external advice before applying for finance.

“The small firms of today are Britain’s international success stories of our future and it is this success that will build the strong, balanced economy that will secure our economic prosperity.”"
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/written-ministerial-statement-on-school-capital-funding,Press release,Written Ministerial Statement on school capital funding,Education Secretary Michael Gove has issued a Written Ministerial Statement on school capital funding.,Department for Education and The Rt Hon Michael Gove,1 March 2013,"1 March 2013

Today I am announcing details of the capital funding of around £4billion that will be made available to create new school places and to carry out maintenance and repair work to existing school buildings.

The number of pupils in England is rising and is set to continue to rise well into the next parliament. Ensuring that every child is able to attend a good or outstanding school in their local area is at the heart of the Government’s comprehensive programme of reform of the school system. We have previously made available core annual allocations of £800million to help local authorities meet the demand for additional school places together with a further £500 million in 2011-12 and £600 million in 2012-13. Today we are allocating capital funding for basic need of £1.6 billion covering the two years 2013-14 and 2014-15.

It is vital that this money is targeted where it is needed and so we have worked with local authorities to improve the way that funding for new school places is distributed across the country.

Until now, we have not had detailed information about the specific areas within local authorities where the demand for school places is expected to increase. This meant that we could not target funding in the most effective way possible to meet pockets of demand within local authorities.

Over the past 12 months, we have worked with local authorities to ensure that funding is distributed more fairly across the country. Local authorities told us that funding should be allocated based solely on projected shortfalls between the places available and the places required within the smaller planning areas that they use when assessing the need for new school places. They also said that funding should be confirmed for at least two years in order to aid better planning.

We redesigned the annual school capacity survey, which local authorities submit to the Department each year, to ensure that, for the first time, we have detailed information about the pressure points within individual authority areas.

As a result of these changes, the distribution of funding to local authorities for additional school places should be fairer, more accurate and better value for money. Some local authorities will see their funding go up, while others will see funding levels go down. This reflects changes in the number of new school places required in different areas of the country as well as the use of more detailed data and it is right that money is allocated where it is needed.

These changes in allocation will get the best value from our core funding for new places. But, in view of the urgent need for more school places following the steep rise in birth rates in many parts of the country, this extra investment needs further enhancement. That is why, in his Autumn Statement on 5 December, the Chancellor announced that the Government will provide additional investment of £982 million for schools in England over the remainder of this parliament.

With this additional money, we are now launching the Targeted Basic Need Programme to fund the provision of new, high quality school places in the areas that need it most. The programme will offer additional support to those local authorities experiencing the greatest pressure on places and will help them to prepare for further rises in pupil numbers. The programme will deliver new Academies and Free Schools, as well as enabling investment to expand existing good and outstanding schools.

Local authorities will be able to bid for funding to increase the number of high quality school places available in areas with the most acute levels of need.  All new schools will open as Academies or Free Schools and successful local authorities will be required to run a competitive process in order to select the best provider. This will enable greater parental choice where it is most needed, thereby driving up standards across the local area.

This, together with the additional local authority allocations we made in 2011-12 and 2012-13 will bring the total amount of funding allocated to local authorities for new school places over the current spending review period to over £5 billion. This is more than double the £1.9 billion spent by the previous government over an equivalent period. We are also setting out our expectation today of greater transparency so that local authorities’ decisions about where to add places are more transparent and accessible to the public. Local authorities will be required to make available details of how they have used their basic need allocations to create additional places and in which schools.

In addition, we must also ensure that existing school buildings are kept in good condition. In 2013-14, as in the previous two years, an additional £1.2 billion will be made available to local authorities and Academies to maintain and improve the condition of existing school buildings across the country.

The previous government did not collect comprehensive and consistent data about the schools most in need of repair and investment. That is why we are in the process of gathering extensive information about the condition of the school estate through the Property Data Survey.  In the meantime, funding for condition and maintenance will be allocated on a simple and transparent per-pupil basis.  In addition to this £1.2bn in 2013-14, a further £200 million of devolved formula capital funding will be given directly to maintained schools and Academies in 2013-14 to maintain the condition of their buildings.

Today’s announcement also includes capital funding for 16-19 provision. £80 million will be made available for 2013-14 and 2014-15 to maintained schools, Academies, sixth form colleges and independent specialist providers to fund additional places needed as a result of demographic changes. This funding will also support the provision of new places for students with learning difficulties and disabilities.

£61 million of capital maintenance funding will be allocated to sixth form colleges in 2013-14. Alongside this, £15 million of capital maintenance funding will be allocated to independent specialist providers for 2013-14 and 2014-15.

Capital allocations for 2013-14 and 2014-15 have been published on theDepartment for Education’s websiteand I will also place a copy of this and accompanying documents in the House Libraries.

For the first time, guidance includes detailed advice on how firms can measure and report on their impact on wildlife and natural services such as clean air, clean water, food, timber, flood protection and welfare benefits.

Environment Minister Lord Taylor of Holbeach said:

“British firms are world leaders in understanding that improving the sustainability and resilience of their whole business is not only good for the environment but good for the bottom line too. This new guidance is another step towards our aim of corporate sustainability reporting becoming normal business practice by making it as simple as possible for companies to show their environmental impact.”

The proposed guidance will help companies to see where they can make savings in their business model. It will also help meet the increased interest from investors in environmental information that is relevant to investment decisions.

The guidance builds on the agreement at Rio+20 where British firms and Government helped secure international support to encourage businesses to include sustainability information in their annual reporting.

Lord Taylor of Holbeach also today announced further details on the new regulation announced at Rio+20 requiring all quoted companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions. A draft of the regulation has been published to update businesses on what will be required of them from April 2013.

Notes

The consultations on new guidance for corporate sustainability reporting and the regulation on reporting of greenhouse gas emissions are available herehttp://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/economy/business-efficiency/reporting

The proposed guidance shows businesses how they can measure and report on their performance in five areas - air quality and emissions, water, biodiversity and ecosystem services, natural materials and waste.

The survey looked at labels on over 500 meat and dairy products purchased from the major retailers and a number of independent shops.  It is the first evaluation of country of origin labelling since the food industry put in place voluntary standards to provide clearer country of origin information to consumers last November.

All butter in the survey was labelled with either the origin of the milk or the place where it was manufactured, or both, while 77 per cent of cheese showed the origin of the milk or the place it was manufactured.

For liquid milk, 86 per cent of products sampled had some form of origin labelling, with half of all milk showing the origin of the milk, while just over a third showed where it was manufactured.

However with fresh cream, a third of products showed no origin statement, and only one sample in six showed where the milk came from, with half showing where it was manufactured.

All retailers’ own-label liquid milk included a statement about where the milk came from, while 59 per cent of branded milk met the same standards.

For bacon, sausages and other lightly processed meat products, 82 per cent had some form of origin labelling,  with 67 per cent providing information on the origin of the meat ingredient, and 15 per cent only listing where the product was manufactured. Nearly one in five didn’t include any origin statement.

More complicated meat products, such as pies and ready meals, showed that 76 per cent included some form of origin statement.

The food industry expects to see further improvements in meeting the voluntary principles as stocks of old packaging and labelling, manufactured before November, are used up.

Jim Paice said:

“Honest food labelling is a priority for me.  Consumers want to see clear, honest labels that allow them to make a choice about the standards and origin of their food.  They are entitled to believe that if a label says or implies that a product is British, it is British.

“The food industry has already taken the initiative on this, but today’s results show there’s still room for improvement.  People are increasingly eating out so we’ll work with the catering sector to make sure they get the right information as well.”

Clearer origin labeling is a key commitment for the government.  The voluntary code agreed in November 2010 will reduce confusion in the origin of products and make the British consumer the best informed in Europe.

The fund will enable engineering companies to establish training programmes to develop future engineers and boost the number of women in the profession.

£10 million of the fund will be directed to a call to ‘Developing Women Engineers’ and £10 million to a call to ‘Improving Engineering Careers’. A further £10 million will be made available in the autumn to develop engineering skills in smaller companies. The calls have been developed in consultation with professional institutions and leading engineering companies from across the sector.

Speaking at the launch of the Manufacture your Future initiative in the West Midlands, Skills and Enterprise Minister Matthew Hancock said:

Skills are central to the UK economy and our long-term competitiveness. In order to allow UK engineering to grow and compete on the world stage we need a guaranteed supply of highly skilled and talented engineers.

As highlighted in the Perkins Review, the engineering sector is currently failing to draw on the whole talent pool. By supporting employers to develop the workforce of the future and bring more women into the engineering, we’re empowering the industry to unlock its potential.

The announcement forms part of the government’s Employer Ownership Fund that enables employers to design training projects that can address skills shortages holding back their business, providing 50% match funding to employers.

‘Developing Women Engineers’ and ‘Improving Engineering Careers’ are the first of a series of focused calls, centred on priority sectors that play a key role in ensuring the UK’s global economic competitiveness. Prospective bidders are encouraged to explore how they can support employees, particularly women, looking to return to the sector and how individuals with relevant skills can be helped to progress to become fully qualified engineers.

The calls come as a direct response to recommendations made in Perkins Review of Engineering, published in November 2013. Professor Perkins’ review of skills within the engineering sector recommended the government invite employers to put forward innovative proposals to develop engineering skills in sectors suffering acute skills shortages.

The government is working together with industry to address these critical issues and establish the skills training that can guarantee a vibrant and prosperous UK engineering sector. This follows a call to action announced in May 2014 supported by over 170 leading organisations across business, education and the third sector. The call to action will create some 2,000 employment opportunities aimed at increasing diversity and put in place a raft of measures geared towards increasing take-up across science, technology, engineering and maths.

Minister for Women Nicky Morgan said:

I am pleased to announce that the government is providing £10 million to help women progress as engineers. We need to move away from the perception that engineering is a ‘man’s world’. Without women pursuing careers in engineering, UK companies are missing out on a vast pool of talent.

The Employer Ownership Fund empowers employers to work with government to solve skills challenges that cannot be supported through mainstream funding. The fund is focused on combating skills shortages in key strategic sectors such as engineering and automotive due to the role they play in driving growth and the government’sIndustrial Strategy.

Terry Scuoler chief executive of EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation said:

The lack of engineering skills in the UK has become a ticking time-bomb, and manufacturers are investing heavily in their current and future workforces to prevent it from exploding. This must include investing in all sections of our workforce, in particular women where the UK has an especially poor record. What has been needed is extra support to push companies to adopt more innovative solutions to truly tackle the skills shortage and gender imbalance that exists in our industry.

The fund announced today will do just that and we will be encouraging manufacturers to get involved and take this opportunity to tackle the skills challenge head-on."

Mr Paice has asked the British Hospitality Association to advise its membership of hotels, restaurants and other venues of the problems and to ask that they discourage customers from using the lanterns.

Releasing sky lanterns is increasingly popular at festivals, weddings and other celebrations across the UK. But after floating for many miles and falling to earth the burnt-out remnants can hurt livestock and litter fields.

Farmers have reported that sheep, cattle and horses are being injured, and in some cases dying, from eating the metal wire frames, which pierce their internal organs. They also report they are being forced to scour fields to pick up the litter.

The Glastonbury festival, which is based on a farm, already has a policy of discouraging the use of sky lanterns and many other music festivals ban them for revellers’ safety.

Mr Paice said: “Anyone who’s seen sky lanterns at night knows how spectacular they are, but they probably don’t know how they can cut a cow’s insides to ribbons and be devastating to the countryside.

“I don’t want to stop people’s enjoyment but I urge everyone to think twice about the impact of a sky lantern after it leaves their hands, and to find another way to celebrate.”"

A key part of achieving FT authorisation is passing a rigorous assessment of their board capability and capacity by Monitor, the FT regulator. To support aspiring FTs to meet this competency, the Department of Health has developed a mandatory board governance assurance framework in partnership with existing FTs and other stakeholders.

In the past, around half of all NHS trusts whose FT application was deferred during the authorisation process was because of a failure of governance, meaning that there were issues with capacity and capability of the board.

The new system, which takes effect from 1 January 2021, will end free movement, reassert control of our borders and restore public trust.

It will assign points for specific skills, qualifications, salaries or professions and visas will only be awarded to those who gain enough points.

The government has listened to the clear message from the 2016 referendum and the 2019 General Election and will end the reliance on cheap, low-skilled labour coming into the country.

Overall levels of migration will be reduced, with tighter security and a better experience for those coming to the UK.

The new single global system will treat EU and non-EU citizens equally. It will give top priority to those with the highest skills and the greatest talents, including scientists, engineers and academics.

Theglobal talent schemewill also be opened up to EU citizens which will allow highly-skilled scientists and researchers to come to the UK without a job offer.

Home Secretary Priti Patel said:

Today is a historic moment for the whole country.

We’re ending free movement, taking back control of our borders and delivering on the people’s priorities by introducing a new UK points-based immigration system, which will bring overall migration numbers down.

We will attract the brightest and the best from around the globe, boosting the economy and our communities, and unleash this country’s full potential.

The points threshold will be carefully set to attract the talent the UK needs. Skilled workers will need to meet a number of relevant criteria, including specific skills and the ability to speak English, to be able to work in the UK. All applicants will be required to have a job offer and, in line with theMigration Advisory Committee’s (MAC) recommendations, the minimum salary threshold will be set at £25,600.

The new points-based system will also expand the skills threshold for skilled workers. Those looking to live and work in the UK will now need to be qualified up to A level or equivalent, rather than degree level under the current system. This will provide greater flexibility and ensure UK business has access to a wide pool of skilled workers.

In line with the government’s manifesto commitment there will be no specific route for low-skilled workers. It is estimated 70% of the existing EU workforce would not meet the requirements of the skilled worker route, which will help to bring overall numbers down in future.

Professor Alice Gast, President of Imperial College London, said:

British science is global. The new post-study work and global talent visas will help us to attract the world’s brightest students and researchers, wherever they come from.

From the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine to clean energy, British science’s international collaborations drive innovation and excellence.

Student visa routes will also be points-based and be opened up to EU citizens, ensuring talent from around the globe has access to the UK’s world-class universities. Those wishing to study in the UK will need to demonstrate that they have an offer from an approved educational institution, that they can support themselves financially and that they speak English.

In addition, theseasonal workers pilot will also be expanded in time for the 2020 harvest from 2,500 to 10,000 places, responding to the specific temporary requirements of the agricultural sector.

EU citizens and other non-visa nationals will not require a visa to enter the UK when visiting the UK for up to 6 months. However, the use of national identity cards will be phased out for travel to the UK and the Home Office will set out our plans in due course.

Those EU citizens resident in the UK by 31 December 2020 can still apply to settle in the UK through theEU Settlement Schemeuntil June 2021."

The government will publish a report on the Constitution in the summer, and Andrew Lansley has asked Professor Steve Field, leader of theNHS Future Forum- a group of the country’s top health experts, to bring together a special working group to provide expert advice.

The NHS Future Forum Working Group on the NHS Constitution, which met for the first time today, is made up of medical professionals, patient champions, staff representatives and charities. At today’s meeting, the group began to consider what effect the NHS Constitution has had for patients and staff since it was launched in 2009.

Andrew Lansley has also asked the new Future Forum group to advise him whether there is any scope for strengthening the NHS Constitution to support high quality services for patients. A public consultation later this year will give patients and staff the opportunity to have their say about what can be done to improve and reinforce the Constitution.

Steve Field, the independent working group chair, said:

‘Throughout the work of the Future Forum, we have consistently said the NHS Constitution should be embedded into how the NHS works, and so I am pleased that we have been asked to contribute to this review.

‘The experience and - crucially - the independence of the group will ensure a thoroughly professional and balanced insight into what effect the NHS Constitution has made and how it can be improved.’

Anupdated version of the NHS Constitutionhas been published today. Andrew Lansley said:

‘I believe in the NHS Constitution, which enshrines the principles which will always hold true for the NHS. This isn’t about starting from scratch - this is about revitalising these rights and pledges. Patients are at the centre of our reforms, and with the help of the independent panel we will look to strengthen the NHS Constitution to make sure it is working for the benefit of patients and staff.’

As part of a series of measures intended to highlight the importance of whistleblowing in the NHS, the updated Constitution includes:

Health SecretaryAndrew Lansleysaid: ‘We have today made it easier for staff to raise concerns about poor patient care. Whistleblowing plays an important part in creating a culture of patient safety, and this is why it has been added to the NHS Constitution.’

The NHS Constitution establishes the principles and values of the NHS in England.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/environment-regulations-under-the-red-tape-spotlight,Press release,Environment regulations under the red tape spotlight,"It will focus on 287 environmental regulations that apply to businesses, covering issues such as waste, emissions and wildlife protection.","Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs",1 September 2011,"Businesses up and down the country are being invited to contribute ideas on how the Government can cut red tape and regulatory burdens without affecting its responsibilities to protect the environment.

For the next three weeks theRed Tape Challenge(RTC) will be focusing on the 287 environmental regulations that apply to businesses, covering issues such as waste, emissions and wildlife protection.

The RTC asks whether existing regulations are providing the environmental protection that is intended and should therefore be retained, or if they are unnecessarily burdensome or redundant and should be scrapped.

People are also being asked for suggestions on how regulations could be simplified to make them easier to follow and more effective, or if an environmental aim could be better achieved through an alternative non-regulatory way. Environmental policies often aim to encourage people to act in certain ways - and overly complex, burdensome regulation may not be the best way to do this.  Simplifying regulations and removing burdens will also benefit the economy by saving businesses millions in unnecessary costs.

Environment Minister Jim Paice said:

“This is not about reducing our standards. Regulation has an important role to play in protecting the environment and our natural resources, but some of the rules we ask businesses to follow are either too complicated, ineffective or just obsolete. The Red Tape Challenge is a chance to tell us how we can protect the environment in a more effective and simpler way that puts fewer burdens on businesses.

“There are also other ways of providing environmental protection that don’t require regulation, which is why we want to hear ideas for doing things differently without affecting our responsibilities to the natural world.”

Energy and Climate Change minister, Charles Hendry said:

“Avoiding dangerous climate change is crucial to our long-term economic success and quality of life and there is no intention to draw back from our climate change commitments.  Quite the opposite, if we are going to tackle climate change we must work with industry to reduce our emissions. It is vital that we make sure our regulations are supporting that effort, not undermining it with red-tape that is ineffective, burdensome or unnecessary.”

Business Minister Mark Prisk said:

“This Government is determined to reduce the burdens that businesses face every day, and these include those relating to things like waste and emissions and other environmental issues.

“Firms are best placed to understand the effect these regulations can have on the day to day running of a business and I hope they can give us an honest and frank appraisal of where improvements can be made, without compromising the protection that the regulations were designed to provide.

“The Red Tape Challenge has already been used to highlight a number of ways in which compliance problems are getting in the way of businesses, and we want to hear the different views on which environmental regulations can be simplified, improved or scrapped.”

Robert Hunt, Executive Director of at Veolia Environmental Services and sector champion for the environment theme, said:

“Protecting the environment and the natural resources it provides are essential for economic growth. Whilst we all know that industry needs proper regulation; overcomplicated rules, Red Tape and unnecessary bureaucracy can have the opposite effect.  The Red Tape Challenge is an opportunity to put this right - to reduce the amount of unnecessary, overcomplicated regulation that hampers business and make it easier for everyone to do what is needed to protect the environment properly. This is a unique chance for businesses to tell Government which regulations are working, which are not or if there are better and easier ways of achieving the same results.”

Defra is already making progress in simplifying and reducing the number of our regulations, but there is scope for more through the Red Tape Challenge. Examples of environmental regulations that are already being simplified or scrapped include:

Some examples of the areas we are inviting ideas on for simplifying regulation or alternative ways of achieving the same, or better, environmental outcomes are:

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/views-sought-on-cap-reform,Press release,Views sought on CAP reform,Those with an interest in the Common Agricultural Policy will be able to present their views on the European Commission's proposed reforms.,"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs",12 December 2011,"Farmers, environmental groups and others with an interest in the Common Agricultural Policy will be able to present their views on the European Commission’s proposed reforms, as part of an informal consultation in England launched by Defra today.

The European Commission published proposals to reform the CAP two months ago, marking the start of at least 18 months of negotiations between all 27 Member States and the European Parliament.

To understand how these proposals will have an impact on a range of sectors in England, Defra is asking for interested parties to answer an online questionnaire.

Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are holding separate consultations, and all these views will inform the UK’s negotiating position.

Agriculture Minister Jim Paice said:

“We’re absolutely committed to being active participants in the negotiations to get the best possible deal for the UK, both on protecting the environment and encouraging an innovative and competitive agriculture sector. That’s why it’s crucial the people on the ground whose lives and professions will be affected are able to tell us their views.

“CAP covers so many areas of life that it’s important we take everything into consideration and bring it to the attention of the EU during the negotiation process.”

Mr Paice also pledged to make sure that English farmers who are thinking about entering or renewing agri-environment agreements could choose to opt out without penalty if they had to make changes to their  agreements as a result of CAP greening.

He added:

“We’ll do everything we possibly can to make sure farmers aren’t disadvantaged because of having been ahead of the game on environmental management. We’ve already told the Commissioner about this a number of times, and it seems he’s listening to our concerns.

“We strongly believe that stewardship schemes are the best way to get better environmental protection from the CAP, but if changes do have to be made to them, at the very least farmers would be able to opt out.”

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/high-pollution-episode-warning-first-summer-smog-of-2011,Press release,High pollution episode warning: First “summer-smog” of 2011,The high pressure system persisting over the UK is forecast to bring warm and still conditions to the UK over the Easter weekend.,"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs",21 April 2011,"These conditions mean it is likely that the UK will experience a high pollution episode this weekend.

Elevated levels of PM10 and ozone reaching high or moderate are expected from now until at least Sunday. The forecast is therefore for high pollution for PM10 and ozone across England and Wales, and low for other pollutants over the weekend.

Some people are more sensitive to ozone than others and may begin to notice an effect on their breathing. People with asthma are not necessarily more sensitive but, if affected, can use their ‘reliever’ inhaler. The public are urged to take sensible precautions such as:

Regular updates on levels of particulate matter (PM10), sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone and carbon monoxide are available atuk-air.defra.gov.uk(UK Air Information Resource) and from Defra’s freephone helpline (0800 556677), which also offers health advice to those who may be particularly sensitive to air pollution.

Ground level ozone is formed when sunlight acts on nitrogen dioxide and other atmospheric substances close to the ground. The pollutants that cause ground level ozone come from a range of sources, including petrol and other fuels.

Air pollution is described as ‘Low (1-3)’, ‘Moderate (4-6)’, ‘High (7-9)’ or ‘Very High (10)’. The classifications were chosen on the basis of effects on health and are based on medical and scientific research. Full details of the bands for all the pollutants are available on the websiteuk-air.defra.gov.uk/air-pollution/bandings.

In addition to the sources of air quality information described in the information bulletin, the information and the air pollution forecast is also sent by e-mail, free of charge, daily to a variety of outlets including regional and national newspapers, television and radio stations, environmental groups, local authorities, and international organisations (e.g. RIVM in the Netherlands). If you would like to be added to this service, ring the Government’s contractors at AEA Energy & Environment (Paul Willis on 0870 190 6602) or subscribe atuk-air.defra.gov.uk.

The following advice on health applies when air pollution is ‘high’ or ‘very high’:

During episodes of air pollution experienced during the summer in the United Kingdom, levels of ozone, nitrogen dioxide and particles may be raised. Most people will experience no ill effects. Those suffering from lung diseases (including asthma) particularly the elderly should be aware that their symptoms might worsen. They may need to consider modifying their treatment as they usually do when symptoms increase, consulting their doctor if this is not effective.

People who have noticed in the past that their breathing is affected on hot, sunny days should avoid strenuous outdoor activity, particularly in the afternoon. Children with asthma should be able to take part in games in the usual way, although they may need to increase their use of reliever medicines before participating. There is no need for them to stay away from school.

Those suffering from a heart condition and who notice a change in their symptoms should get medical advice as they normally would.

When air pollution levels are presented to the public, an overall summary is provided followed by pollutant specific information. When the overall summary is presented for each region, levels of air pollution are described as those occurring in the highest band for any individual pollutant. For example, if levels of all pollutants in a region were low, with the exception of one pollutant that was high, then in the overall summary the air pollution for that region would be described as ‘high’.

The Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland was published in July 2007.  It aims to:

The UK is currently meeting the air quality objectives in most parts of the country - up to 99.5% in some cases. Some objectives are more challenging to meet at certain locations, for example nitrogen dioxide, ozone and particulates. The UK is working towards achieving these objectives as soon as possible in the locations where they are still exceeded.

The EU Directive on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe (2008/50/EC) was transposed into national law in June 2010. The directive consolidated existing air quality legislation, set new standards for fine particles (PM2.5), and provides some flexibility for Member States in meeting some existing standards in areas where, across Europe, there has been widespread difficulties in complying.

The target values for ozone for the protection of human health and the protection of vegetation, remain unchanged from the Ozone Directive (2002/3/EC; third Daughter Directive).  These are:

Where the target values are not met the UK must put in place plans to achieve them, except where the target values are not achievable through proportionate measures. The Directive also sets long-term objectives for ozone levels for the protection of human health and vegetation with the year 2020 as a bench-mark. The Directive also requires that the public be informed when hourly levels are above an ‘information threshold’ of 180 micrograms per metre cubed or a ‘warning threshold’ of 240 micrograms per metre cubed. The UK complies with this requirement.

The target values in the ozone Directive were developed in line with the national emissions ceilings for NOX and VOCs, ozone precursors, set under the National Emissions Ceilings Directive (NECD).

Emissions of ozone precursors across the EU are controlled by the National Emission Ceilings Directive which sets limits on the amounts of nitrogen oxides and Volatile Organic Compounds that each Member State can emit annually, with ceilings to be met by 2010. The latest UK emissions data shows the UK to be compliant with its 2010 emission ceilings for all four of the major air pollutants. The UK is currently projected to remain compliant with its ceilings in 2010 and beyond. The 1999 Gothenburg Protocol does the same for a larger group of countries under the auspices of the UN Economic Commission for Europe.

The Gothenburg Protocol is currently under review and is expected to set new emission ceilings to be achieved by 2020. The National Emission Ceilings Directive will be reviewed in 2013 and is also likely to set new ceilings.

Delivery of reduced ozone concentrations in ambient air is challenging due to increasing global background levels, changes in atmospheric chemistry, changing climate (hotter summers) and reduced urban emissions of oxides of nitrogen. Evidence suggests that local or short term measures are ineffective at reducing ozone concentrations. Reflecting this, EU air quality legislation sets targets and long term objectives for ozone concentrations (rather than the legally binding limit values set for pollutants such as PM10) and public information requirements should certain thresholds be exceeded.

A short report entitled ‘An estimate of the health impact of the August 2003 Photochemical episode’ by John Stedman at AEA was published on 13 January 2004. This estimated the contribution of ground level ozone and particulate matter (PM10) to the number of deaths brought forward by in the first two weeks of August 2003.

_“We are working closely withFSAandDefrato investigate how horsemeat got into the UK food chain. _

“There is nothing to suggest a safety risk to consumers who may have eaten the products. All of the retailers involved so far have removed potentially affected products from their shelves.

“Phenylbutazone is used to treat some people who suffer from ankylosing spondylitis, a type of arthritis. However, there are international checks to prevent phenylbutazone from entering the food chain because there is a low risk of serious effects - such as aplastic anaemia - in some people.

“As such, it presents a limited public health risk and I support the FSA advice that it should be excluded from the food chain.

“There is currently no indication that phenylbutazone - bute - is present in any of the products that have been identified in this country but the FSA has ordered further tests to confirm this.

“It’s understandable that people will be concerned, but it is important to emphasise that, even if bute is found to be present at low levels, there is a very low risk indeed that it would cause any harm to health.”"

A personal health budget is an amount of money given to someone, to help them design a package of care support from clinicians and others, giving them more control over the nature of the treatment provided.

Personal health budgets have been piloted at 20 in-depth sites for the last three years, and an independent evaluation of the pilot programme published today has found that:

Read the evaluation report on the personal health budgets website

The benefits seemed to be felt more strongly by people with the highest health needs. As a result, the rollout will initially target those who are currently getting NHS Continuing Healthcare. By April 2014 up to 56,000 people on the NHS Continuing Healthcare scheme will have the right to ask for a personal health budget. It is also hoped that clinical commissioning groups will offer a personal health budget to more people with a long term condition who may benefit.

Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb said:

“Independent analysis has now shown that personal health budgets can put people back in control of their care and make a significant difference to their quality of life. It’s inspiring to hear the human stories of success that these budgets have brought to people.

“The evaluation shows that those with the greatest needs benefit most from personal health budgets. That’s why we are giving people on NHS continuing healthcare the chance to get one first. And, I hope more people who could benefit will be given the option of one.” ****

In these films people who participated in the pilot programme talk about what the process is like, what they spend their money on, how they decided on this, and the impact on their health and lives. The eight stories also include the perspectives of family carers and health care professionals.

Nikki from Dorset uses her personal budget to employ three carers on a flexible basis who can provide immediate care for severe flare ups of rheumatoid athritis, meaning few hospital admissions and a better quality of life.

Health staff, including GPs, community nurses and care coordinators, describe how personal health budgets have improved their patients’ lives.

The system will help doctors keep up to the standard expected of them by ensuring they stay up-to-date with the latest techniques, technologies and research. Revalidation will also require a doctor to tackle any concerns about skills such as communication and maintaining trust with patients.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said:

“We want to have the best survival rates in Europe for the major killer diseases. Doctors save lives every day and making sure they are up to speed with the latest treatments and technologies will help them save even more. This is why a proper system of revalidation is so important.”

Medical revalidation will normally happen every five years and will apply to all doctors in all settings in the UK - including doctors working as locums and in the private sector. Doctors will undergo annual appraisals based on the requirements of theGMC’s core guidance Good Medical Practice.

A responsible officer, who is usually the medical director, will make sure that doctors have access to a good quality annual appraisal and that any issues from that appraisal are addressed. They will also review evidence from those appraisals and make a recommendation to the GMC about the doctor’s continuing fitness to practise every five years. This evidence must include examples of quality improvement activity, any significant events, feedback from colleagues and patients and a review of any complaints and compliments from patients.

The decision regarding renewal of a doctor’s licence to practise will be made by the GMC.

Professor Sir Peter Rubin, Chair of the GMC, said:

“This is an historic day for patients and for the medical profession. We are confident that the introduction of revalidation will make a major contribution to the quality of care that patients receive and will give them valuable assurance that the doctors who treat them are regularly assessed against our professional standards.”

The Department of Health has worked extensively with the GMC, the Royal Colleges, employers, patients’ groups and the British Medical Association to ensure that the revalidation strikes the right balance and does not take up a disproportionate amount of a doctor’s time. The GMC will work with employers to implement and manage the system.

The new system has undergone an extensive programme of testing and piloting, involving more than 4,000 doctors.

Sainsbury’s, The Co-operative and Waitrose have already been trialling hiding tobacco displays. Other shops have just one month to find out if they are classified as a large shop, to plan how they are going to cover up their tobacco displays and to train their counter staff on the new law.

Ending open cigarette displays will help people trying to quit smoking and help change attitudes and social norms around smoking.

Chief Medical Officer, Professor Dame Sally Daviessaid:

“More than 8 million people in England still smoke - it is our biggest preventable killer and causes more than 80,000 deaths each year.

“Nearly two-thirds of current and ex-smokers say that they started smoking before they were 18, with 39% saying that they were smoking regularly before the age of 16.

“With only one month to go until large shops need to cover up their tobacco displays, we will soon start protecting children and young people from the unsolicited promotion of tobacco products in shops, helping them to resist the temptation to start smoking. This will also help and support adults who are trying to quit.”

Large shops are defined as having a relevant floor space of more than 280m², as used in the current Sunday Trading law, which is already familiar to many retailers.

Cigarettes and all tobacco products will need to be hidden from view except when staff are serving customers or carrying out other day-to-day tasks such as restocking.

When serving customers or actively carrying out one of the other tasks allowed, each temporary tobacco display must not exceed 1.5 m².

Guidance on the new law is available on Businesslinkor throughlocal authority trading standards departments.

For all other shops, the regulations will need to be implemented from April 2015."

Five new Rural Growth Networks across England will enable businesses in rural areas to reach their potential by breaking down barriers to economic growth, such as a shortage of work premises, slow internet connection and fragmented business networks.

Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said;

“Great business ideas have been held back by the challenges of a rural location for far too long. Rural Growth Networks will fix problems like a shortage of work premises and limited internet access to give rural entrepreneurs the chance to get their business ideas off the ground and achieve their full potential.

“Our £15 million investment will create thousands of new jobs and hundreds of new businesses, boosting the rural economy and supporting thriving local communities. Altogether we’re spending £165 million to support economic growth in rural England, and shows once again that we are firmly on the side of rural communities.”

Five public and private sector partnerships have been selected to each deliver a regional Rural Growth Network. The five pilots will be run over three years in Swindon and Wiltshire; Durham and Northumberland; Devon and Somerset; Cumbria and Coventry and Warwickshire.

As well as transforming business prospects in these areas, each Rural Growth Network will be a pilot to help the Government look at how best to increase the economic potential of rural areas across the country.

Up to £2 million of the Government’s investment in Rural Growth Networks will target rural enterprises led by women.

Home Secretary and Minister for Women and Equalities Theresa May said;

“Women have a vital role to play and we want to encourage them to fully contribute their skills and talents to the economic recovery.  Establishing or growing a rural business presents particular challenges which this £2 million will help overcome.

“Women are about half as likely as men to be engaged in entrepreneurial activity. We want to inspire and help women achieve their potential, which is vital to generating long term sustainable growth.”

The five Rural Growth Networks were selected based on their potential to grow the local economy by creating jobs and providing new business opportunities.

Each application made proposals for supporting rural businesses and tackling local barriers to growth, such as a lack of superfast broadband, a shortage of business premises, fragmented business networks, limited training opportunities and poor infrastructure. Rural Growth Networks will enable businesses to overcome these problems and establish new business hubs at the centre of rural communities.

Rural Growth Networks are part of a £165 million package from the Government to stimulate economic growth in rural businesses and communities. Measures announced in November in the Rural Economy Growth Review include:

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-plans-to-assess-uk-progress-towards-sustainable-future,Press release,New plans to assess UK progress towards sustainable future,Defra has launched a consultation on a new set of Sustainable Development Indicators (SDIs).,"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs",24 July 2012,"The UK’s progress towards sustainable long-term economic growth and social wellbeing will be easier for people to track under new plans announced by Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman.

Defra has launched a consultation on a new set of Sustainable Development Indicators (SDIs) providing an overview of the UK’s progress towards a more sustainable economy, society, and environment.

The indicators will make it easier for people to monitor if the UK is developing in a sustainable way and help Government see where more work needs to be done. Updates will be published annually with a scorecard showing whether progress is in the right direction.

Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said:

“We want to help our economy, our communities and the environment to grow and flourish in a sustainable way for the benefit of future generations. We have put sustainability at the heart of everything that the Government does, and these new indicators will help us take stock of our progress and give the public the means to chart our success.

“At Rio+20 we successfully argued for the need for countries to look beyond their economic performance as a measure of progress. These indicators along with the measures of wellbeing underline our own commitment to going beyond GDP to measure the health and wealth of the UK.”

Assessments on our use of natural resources, and the skills and knowledge we possess, are amongst the new measurements proposed. Twelve headline measures are supported by 25 supplementary indicators.

The revised Sustainable Development Indicators will be used alongside the national wellbeing measures developed by the Office for National Statistics, and work on valuations of our natural resources, to provide a wide set of measures to view how society is progressing. Taken together, these measures demonstrate the UK’s leading role in championing the need to move beyond GDP as the sole measure of progress, which received international recognition at Rio+20.

Previous SDIs have been widely used outside of Government by academics, NGOs and businesses. This consultation will give these groups the opportunity to give us their views and feedback on the new proposed SDIs.

Notes

The consultation on the new Sustainable Development Indicators can be found on the Defra website herehttp://www.defra.gov.uk/consult/open/

The 12 headline indicators are economic prosperity, long term unemployment, poverty, knowledge and skills, healthy life expectancy, social capital, social mobility in adulthood, housing provision, greenhouse gas emissions, natural resource use, wildlife and biodiversity, and water availability.

The indicators proposed in this consultation document relate predominantly to England. However in some cases where it more sensible to do so a UK measure will be used.

The proposed indicators are not binding on the other countries in the UK, which have their own approaches to Sustainable Development."

They demonstrated how they would create jobs and a high level of economic growth in their local communities over the coming years.

The RGF is a £1.4bn fund which is designed to encourage enterprise, growth and jobs in the private sector and support areas and communities that are dependent on the public sector.

The Government expects over 27,000 jobs to be directly created and safeguarded, with close to a further 100,000 jobs in associated supply chains and local economies.

The second round of the fund opens to bids today. This round will aim to allocate the remainder of nearly £1 billion.

Announcing the successful bids, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said:

“I was bowled over by the quality of the bids. This money will now help create and safeguard jobs in some of the communities worst hit by the economic downturn.

“Today is a step towards rebalancing our economy away from an unhealthy overreliance on a small number of industries and a few areas. We need to spread opportunity across the whole country, drawing on our many talents.”

The successful bids include the development of a former eye hospital in Manchester into a biomedical centre of excellence; the construction of a manufacturing plant on Teesside to develop resins for food and drink packaging; development of a cutting edge factory & R&D laboratory for Holroyd Precision Ltd in Rochdale, and a proposal from General Motors to build the next-generation Vivaro van in Luton.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said:

“Supporting job creation in the regions is vital if we are to drive growth in our local communities.

“We have received a large number of ambitious and highly competitive bids to this first round of the Regional Growth Fund, which will help a number of businesses across the country to expand and create thousands of new jobs.

“The Regional Growth Fund is a competitive fund and we wanted to see proposals that created jobs in the private sector, in areas of deprivation and that is at risk of suffering from public sector cuts. I’m confident that the successful bids we have chosen will deliver on this.”"

Mr Todd will take up his position on July 4, in order to play a full role in planning for the executive agency.

The agency, based within the Department for Education, will oversee statutory tests and assessments for children up to age 14.

Mr Todd has held a number of senior public service roles, most recently as chief executive and registrar of the General Dental Council. He has also worked at the Nursing and Midwifery Council and the London Ambulance Service NHS Trust.

He said:

I am delighted to be able to take on this new role at such a key time.  The coming year brings welcome changes to statutory assessment and I am looking forward to the challenges involved and to the next steps in planning for the new agency.

Education Secretary Michael Gove said:

I am delighted that Ian Todd has accepted this vital role. His skills will ensure that the new agency oversees testing and assessment for thousands of our children every year in a thorough, effective and professional manner.

Ian Todd was previously chief executive and registrar of the General Dental Council and before that was director of fitness and practice at the Nursing and Midwifery Council. Prior to entering the world of regulation, Ian spent 13 years in the NHS ambulance service in both clinical and management roles, including at director level.

The appointments process for the appointment of Ian Todd was overseen by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments, with the process chaired by a Commissioner, and the appointment made on merit; political activity played no part in the decision-making process. However, in accordance with the original Nolan recommendations and the code of practice, there is a requirement for appointees’ political activity (if any declared), and other information, to be made public. Mr Todd declared no such activity. Education Secretary Michael Gove approved the appointment but had no formal role in the interview process.

The Standards and Testing Agency is being established to deliver National Curriculum tests and assessments following Ministerial decisions to close the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency (QCDA). QCDA closure is subject to the passage of legislation.

The agency will be responsible for statutory testing and assessment for pupils up to 14. Its exact remit will be confirmed following consideration of the recommendations of Lord Bew’s review of Key Stage 2 testing, assessment and accountability. Ofqual, the independent regulator, will continue to have an important role in regulating to ensure the integrity and impartiality of national curriculum tests. Mr Todd will report to a senior civil servant within the Department for Education and within a Department for Education governance structure accountable to the Secretary of State.

With State Aid clearance from the European Commission in December, this agreement allows Government to press forward with the next step of the procurement, aiming to have a contractor ready to start work in May.

We have previously announced up to £150m funding toimprove mobile coverage and quality across the UK- known as the Mobile Infrastructure Project (MIP). This is intended to improve mobile phone coverage through building additional mobile phone masts in uncovered areas, whilst ensuring technical solutions are compatible with future technological developments. There are areas of the UK where no mobile coverage is provided by any Mobile Network Operator.

In certain areas of the UK, particularly rural areas, there is a limited commercial case for market-driven private investment to improve coverage. Ofcom haveidentified 80,484 premises in complete “not spots”. The aim of the MIP is to cover as many of these premises as we can, as well as ten roads identified in the 2012 Budget.

We have capital funding available to take forward building masts with power and network connections. The procurement underway is to identify a MIP Provider to build, own and operate this infrastructure.

This is only part of the story though. The Mobile Network Operators have agreed to provide the actual network coverage from the masts, as well as meeting the running costs for the sites for their operating life, giving us a sustainable solution to mobile coverage."

This will include:

• awareness, understanding and use of the Acas Code of Practice on Discipline and Grievance.• the idea of compensated no-fault dismissal for micro-businesses with less than 10 employees.

_Take part in the call for evidence_

Business Secretary Vince Cable said:

“The UK already has one of the world’s most flexible, adaptable labour markets, making it one of our strengths and it stands up very well in international comparisons. However, we recognise that there is room for improvement which balances the needs of business while ensuring that the necessary employment protections are upheld.

“We are already implementing a radical package of reforms to the employment tribunal system and increasing the qualifying period for unfair dismissal from one to two years. These are all measures that will help improve the way businesses hire, manage and end a working relationship.

“But we also recognise that not all jobs work out for both parties - the staff member doesn’t quite fit or simply the relationship has irretrievably broken down. And for micros in particular, who often don’t have legal or HR teams, the process to let a staff member go can be a daunting and complicated process.

“We want to give businesses the confidence to hire new staff and make sure when a dismissal needs to be made, they aren’t tied up in red tape. This is an effort to see how extensive the problem is and shed some light on the desire for a change to the rules.”

The Government also published the annual update on the Employment Law Review.

This includes an update to the Employer’s Charter, which now includes pointers on sickness absence and recruitment.

The Charter aims to counter the misconception that employment protections are all one-way - towards the employee. It gives greater clarity to managers on what they can already do to deal with issues in the workplaces, on subjects such as performance, sick leave, maternity leave, requests for flexible working and redundancy."

Born out of the Football Licensing Authority, that has worked to improve spectator safety at football grounds since 1990 the SGSA can now work with other sports, in addition to football, to help maintain the highest standards of spectator safety. The SGSA will also be able to share best practice and expertise beyond England and Wales.

Hugh Robertson said:

“The Football Licensing Authority played a critical role in spectator safety at football grounds over the past two decades. The Sports Grounds Safety Authority will build on that success by taking its expertise and advice into other sports and ensure that spectator safety is properly implemented at all sports grounds.”

Ruth Shaw, chief executive of the SGSA said:

“It’s an extremely exciting time as we become the Sports Grounds Safety Authority. Hundreds of thousands of people attend sporting events in stadia around the world every week, and we have a unique role to play in helping to create the conditions for safe, secure and enjoyable experiences for all spectators. We’ll build on the significant achievements of the Football Licensing Authority, continue to provide world class advice and guidance, and embrace the opportunities and challenges that the new role will bring.”

Paul Darling QC, Chair of the SGSA said:

“These are exciting times for the organisation. We are determined to maintain our contribution to football spectator safety but are equally determined to make that expertise available to other sports and internationally. As an organisation we have achieved a great deal already, but there is still more we can contribute to ensure safety at sports grounds and the SGSA will provide us with the opportunity to do this.”

The Sports Grounds Safety Authority was established through the Sports Grounds Safety Authority Act 2011.

The FLA was set up as an independent public body, under the Football Spectators’ Act 1989 and is funded by the Department for Culture Media and Sport (DCMS). It was charged with implementing some of the Taylor Report’s key recommendations by monitoring local authorities’ oversight of spectator safety at international, premiership and football league grounds in England and Wales, and implementing a system of licensing to deliver the Government’s policy on seated accommodation. The SGSA will continue to carry out the statutory functions under the Football Spectators Act 1989 in England and Wales.

The Sports Grounds Safety Authority Act 2011 provided the vehicle for the FLA to become the SGSA. The Act also expanded the remit of the SGSA to enable it to work with other sports as well as football and in countries outside of England and Wales. The Act had cross party support and received Royal Assent in July 2011. The SGSA will commence 1 November 2011.

The meeting discussed issues around managing traffic on the web and protecting the open Internet as well as the potential of creating an industry-wide agreement or set of principles, which could be used to guide self-regulation.

Web inventorSir Tim Berners-Leeagreed to help theBroadband Stakeholder Groupbuild upon their recently published transparency document to include the rights of consumers and business to connect to whomever they wanted on the Internet without discrimination.

Sir Tim said “While transparency about traffic management policy is a good thing, best practices should also include the neutrality of the net. The web has grown so fast precisely because we have had two independent markets, one for connectivity, and the other for content and applications.”

Mr Vaizeysaid

This was a useful and productive meeting.  It gave all interested parties the opportunity to air their views and discuss these issues.

Internet traffic is growing.  Handling that heavier traffic will become an increasingly significant issue so it was important to discuss how to ensure the internet remains an open, innovative and competitive place.

It is good to see that industry has taken the lead on agreeing greater transparency for their traffic management policies.  I am pleased that someone with the expertise of Sir Tim has agreed to work with industry on expanding that agreement to cover managing and maintaining the open Internet.

That agreement should be guided by three simple principles. The first is users should be able to access all legal content. Second, there should be no discrimination against content providers on the basis of commercial rivalry and finally traffic management policies should be clear and transparent.

The Internet has brought huge economic and social benefits across the world because of its openness and that must continue."

Existing cities can also bid for the award of a Lord Mayoralty or, in Scotland, a Lord Provostship.

The two awards - known as ‘civic honours’ - are rare marks of distinction which are sparingly granted. They will be made in honour of the60th anniversary of The Queen’s accession to the throne.

Civic honours were last awarded in 2002, to mark the Golden Jubilee, when Preston, Stirling, Newport, Lisburn and Newry were awarded city status, and Exeter was awarded a Lord Mayoralty. In 2012, just one award of city status and one award of Lord Mayoralty is expected to be made.

“Marking Her Majesty’s 60 years on the throne in 2012 will be a great opportunity for the nation to come together in celebration, just as it did for her Silver and Golden Jubilees,” saidJeremy Hunt, Secretary of State for Culture. “This competition will be an important part of this and will ensure that there is a lasting legacy that will remain long after the festivities are over. I look forward to hearing who’s won.”

Local authorities should followentry guidelines, published today, when submitting their applications. The results of the compteition will be announced in the first half of 2012."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/judging-starts-on-regional-growth-fund-bids,News story,Judging starts on Regional Growth Fund bids,BIS has received more than 490 bids competing for a share of £950 million from round 2 of the Regional Growth Fund.,"Department for Business, Innovation & Skills and The Rt Hon Nick Clegg",29 July 2011,"These bids were received in response to the second round of the£1.4 billion fund,which is designed to encourage enterprise, growth and jobs in the private sector and support regions that are dependent on the public sector. The bids will compete for a share of £950 million.

Further details on regional spread and total value of the bids.

The 492 bids, asking for £3.3 billion, are being assessed by the Independent Advisory Board, chaired by Lord Heseltine, over the summer. The board will then make recommendations to a board of ministers, led by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, which will make the final decisions as to which proposals should receive funding. It is expected that the successful bidders will be announced in the autumn.

There were 140 bids received for the North West - the highest of all the regions, which account for 28 per cent of all the bids received. More than 330 of the total number of bids received are bidding for between £1 million and £5 million.

The Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, said:

“This vital regional fund uses government investment and multiplies it to give a real boost to local businesses. Round one is already helping local economies across the country and has attracted £2.5 billion of private sector investment.

“This will directly create or protect over 27,000 jobs, and secure around a further 100,000 jobs on related supply chains and in local economies. We welcome the bids received for the second round, and hope we can do even more this time.”

The allocation of funding each successful proposal will receive will be the minimum amount the proposal needs to get off the ground.

Each bid must also demonstrate it is bringing in private sources of funding as well. The public investment in the first 50 successful bids is expected to secure a further £2.5 billion of private investment.

Lord Heseltine said:

“We knew from the road shows there was going to be a huge amount of interest in the second round of the Regional Growth Fund, and we have been overwhelmed by the volume of bids submitted.

“There is clearly a hunger for public support which will allow new and exciting projects to deliver jobs and growth in their local communities to get off the ground, and I’m pleased to see so many people wanting to be a part of this. We now face the difficult task of assessing each of these bids; we have a busy summer ahead of us!”

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/beis-in-the-queens-speech,News story,BEIS in the Queen's Speech,BEIS priorities set out in the 2021 Queen's Speech.,"Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy and The Rt Hon Kwasi Kwarteng",12 May 2021,"Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has today (12 May) welcomed this week’s Queen’s Speech, which reinforced the UK’s commitments to becoming a global science superpower, taking advantage of the UK’s departure from the European Union, and strengthening our energy security as we transition to a net zero future.

The speech set out the government’s legislative agenda for this parliamentary session and affirmed the government’s commitment to deliver on the people’s priorities as the UK builds back better from the pandemic. It follows the government acting on an unprecedented scale to protect jobs, livelihoods, businesses and public services throughout the pandemic, which the government is building on through its flagshipPlan for Jobsthat will increase job opportunities in all parts of the UK backed by £30 billion of investment.

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said:

After such a difficult year, our immediate priority is to continue standing by workers and businesses as we have done throughout the pandemic, backed by an unprecedented £352 billion package of support.

But as we reopen our economy and look ahead to the future with a renewed optimism, the Queen’s Speech shows this government has an ambitious legislative agenda to deliver on the people’s priorities - seizing the opportunities as an independent trading nation, cementing our status as a science superpower, and ensuring we build back better from the pandemic.

The Advanced Research and Invention Agency (ARIA) Bill is going through Parliament following its introduction in March. Backed by £800 million of funding,ARIAwill support cutting-edge research, turning ideas into new technologies that transform people’s lives, and cement the UK’s position as a global science superpower.

Investment in research and development will be critical to the economic and social recovery from the impacts ofCOVID-19, enabling us to build back better for a greener, healthier and more resilient UK.

The government is investing £14.9 billion in research and development in 2021 to 2022. This means governmentR&Dspending is now at its highest level in 4 decades.

The Professional Qualifications Bill will mean skilled professionals from around the world can seek recognition to practise in the UK in areas where their skills are in need.

Supporting the UK’s key regulated professions to deliver the vital services on which we rely is a priority for the government. Regulators are the experts in their field and must have the autonomy to set the standard required to practise in the UK, ensuring quality and safety.

Previously, when part of the European Union, regulators of professions were required to have routes to recognising professionals from other EU countries. Now the UK government, devolved administrations and regulators are being equipped with the tools to put in place recognition routes that meet the demands of individual professions in different parts of the UK.

As the UK is no longer bound by the EU’s bureaucratic and prescriptive state aid rules, the government’s Subsidy Control Bill will create a new, tailored UK-wide subsidy control framework for providing more tailored financial support to businesses - including innovative,R&Dfocused industries to encourage job creation and growth across all parts of the UK.

The new framework will reflect the UK’s strategic interests, strengthen the Union, and help to drive economic growth and level up opportunity and prosperity across the whole of the UK as we build back better from the pandemic.

The Business Secretary has reaffirmed that the UK will not return to the failed 1970s approach of the government trying to run the economy, ‘picking winners’ or bailing out unsustainable companies.

The UK is a world-leader in tackling climate change. Renewable electricity generation has more than quadrupled since 2010, coal’s share of generation has fallen from 40% in 2012 to under 3% in 2019, and the UK has the world’s largest offshore wind capacity.

In 2019, the UK went even further by becoming the first major economy in the world to make a legally binding commitment to end its contribution to global warming by 2050 by reaching net zero emissions.

This parliamentary session will see a Downstream Oil Resilience Bill published in draft form to support a secure transition away from fossil fuels to renewables as we go further to tackle climate change. It will provide the government with a strengthened ability to protect fuel supply resilience and prevent supply disruptions from occurring.

This follows the publication last year of the Energy White Paper, setting out the transformation of the UK’s energy system. This will create new industries, unleash private capital in green innovation and support up to 220,000 jobs by 2030.

The UK will host the vitalCOP26climate negotiations in November this year and the UK government intends to use this role to catalyse ambitious global action to cut emissions further, help communities adapt and increase resilience, and harness growing momentum to take us closer to delivering the goals of the Paris Agreement."

An action plan to help the British tourism industry achieve …","Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport and John Penrose",7 March 2011,"Anaction planto help the British tourism industry achieve its potential as part of Britain’s growth strategy has been unveiled by Tourism MinisterJohn Penrose.

The strategy aims to exploit the opportunities of next year’sOlympicsandDiamond Jubileeto help attract an extra four million overseas visitors over the next four years, bringing in an extra £2 billion of spending and creating thousands of jobs.

Proposals include simplifying the process of getting tourist visas, helping to improve staff skills in the tourism sector and consulting on whether to lengthen the tourism season by moving the May Day bank holiday.

The Government has committed to helping the sector prepare for changes in technology and a task force, led by senior industry figures, will also be established to identify red tape holding back the industry.

“The UK tourism industry is very big business indeed,” Mr Penrose said. “It generates £90 billion for the economy every year, employing 1.36 million people and supporting more than 200,000 businesses, large and small.  So it’s no surprise that the Government sees it as a key element in our plans to grow the economy and get Britain back on its feet.  And by making the most of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee and the Olympics next year, the industry has a fantastic chance to step up a further gear and make an even greater contribution to our national recovery.

“The Prime Minister asked me last year to prepare a report on the industry and to set out positive steps that we could take to promote growth.  This strategy paper is the result - a simple blueprint of practical ideas that show what can be done when government departments and agencies work together towards a common goal. The next four years are set to be the most important and successful for this industry in more than a generation.  The challenge is huge, but the rewards for us all could be greater still.”"

The painting, which dates from c.1718 shortly before the artist’s untimely death at the age of 37, shows a man, dressed as the theatrical character Mezzetin, playing a guitar next to an embracing couple. Watteau was associated with paintings of the fetes galantes, a genre of his invention in which elegant couples converse and flirt in outdoor settings.

The Minister’s rulingfollows a recommendation by the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest, administered by theMuseums, Libraries and Archives Council(MLA). The Committee recommended that the export decision be deferred on the grounds that the painting is of outstanding aesthetic importance.

The decision on the export licence application for the painting will be deferred for a period ending on 6 September 2011 inclusive. This period may be extended until 6 June 2012 inclusive if a serious intention to raise funds with a view to making an offer to purchase the painting at the recommended price of £17,500,000 is expressed.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/primary-schools-test-results-released,Press release,Primary schools’ test results released,News on a bid to improve standards in primary schools.,Department for Education,13 December 2012,"The Department for Education last year introduced new tougher floor targets for primary schools in a bid to drive up standards. As well as being higher, schools not meeting them faced similar consequences to what secondary schools faced.

Now, schools where fewer than 60% of pupils achieve at least the expected level (level 4) in English and maths combined, and are down on progress measures for English and maths, are deemed to be below the floor.

Results published today show that fewer schools are below the floor this year.

In 2011, 1,310 primary schools were below the floor.

This year 476 schools are below the floor. A further 45 were also below the floor but have since closed, 37 of them to become academies.

A Department for Education spokesman said:

This government brought in higher primary school floor targets with one aim in mind - to drive up standards with immediate effect to end years of chronic under-performance.

Today’s figures demonstrate that schools have responded to the challenge. The floor standards we introduced were tougher and have improved performance. Heads, teachers and pupils deserve credit for meeting the challenge head on.

Schools with a long history of under-performance, and who are not stepping up to the mark, face being taken over by an academy sponsor. The expertise and strong leadership provided by sponsors is the best way to turn around weak schools and give pupils there the best chance of a first-class education.

To be deemed below the floor, a school needs to be down on all three of the new measures that make up the primary school floor standard:

Schools below the floor by region:

Local authorities with highest percentage of schools below the floor:

The ‘sponsored academy’ programme is in addition to the hundreds of schools which can convert to academy status (known as ‘converter academies’).

The academy programme was previously focused on under-performing secondary schools. This government is now using academies to tackle weak primary schools as well. It has also allowed schools to take advantage of the freedoms and autonomy on offer by academy status, by converting.

As at December 1, there are now 932 open primary academies in England - 751 are converter academies and 181 are sponsored.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/review-of-ccpr-voluntary-sports-broadcasting-code-launched,Press release,Review of CCPR voluntary sports broadcasting code launched,Sports Minister Hugh Robertson calls for more funding from broadcast deals to filter down to the grassroots.,"Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport and The Rt Hon Hugh Robertson",20 July 2010,"The CCPR is to review its voluntary code of conduct for sports broadcasting with a view to generating a funding boost to grassroots sport, Sports Minister Hugh Robertson announced today.

The Code aims to encourage the reinvestment of revenues from television broadcasting rights of major sporting events to community sport.

National governing bodies, including the Football Association, the Lawn Tennis Association and the England and Wales Cricket Board, are signatories to the code and currently agree to invest a minimum of five per cent of broadcasting rights to the grassroots.

However Robertson would like to see the code changed with the minimum being increased to 30 per cent.

Robertson said:

“I have asked the CCPR to undertake this review as part of my drive to extend the opportunities through sport to the maximum number of people. While 30 per cent may sound ambitious I am optimistic that this can be achieved. National governing bodies have a duty to ensure that they have the strongest community structure possible. A thriving grassroots is only going to help the sport at the top end.”

CCPR chief executive Tim Lamb said:

“The voluntary code of conduct already ensures that tens of millions of pounds are returned to grassroots sports each year. That makes possible all kinds of community programmes which wouldn’t otherwise happen. All signatories reinvest significantly more than five per cent, but a potential increase to 30 per cent would provide even more of a cast-iron guarantee for grassroots sport.

“Governing bodies are uniquely placed to strike an appropriate balance between exposure for their sport and broadcasting revenues. The voluntary code ensures that everyone has a chance to see iconic sporting events on free-to-air television, yet at the same time it allows governing bodies to raise enough money to keep those events and the grassroots of their sports healthy in the current difficult economic times.”

The review of the code will focus on national governing bodies, but will allow some flexibility for other current signatories such as the Premier League and the PGA European Tour.

Under the code the five per cent investment includes expenditure by governing bodies on youth programmes, community sports facilities, education and training, research and development.

Thereport, sub-titled Democratising Philanthropy, by technology entrepreneur and Chair of the Community Foundation Network Matthew Bowcock, shows how arts and heritage bodies could unlock support by engaging broader audiences, and how more individuals can become philanthropists.

Culture SecretaryMaria Millersaid:

Matthew Bowcock believes that everyone is a potential philanthropist.  This reinforces my view that we should not regard philanthropy as solely being about getting the rich to give more.  Everyone has the opportunity to give, whether time or money.

Digital technology means we can strengthen the relationship between artists and their audiences.  A number of far-sighted cultural organisations are already doing so, harnessing digital technology to support their fundraising efforts, but many others are not.  I would encourage all arts and heritage bodies to read this report.

Matthew Bowcock’s work complements the recent reports on ‘Removing Barriers to Legacy Giving’ and ‘Philanthropy Beyond London’ and will help inform the future Government strategy for boosting philanthropy in the cultural sector.  All three reports contain advice on ways to strengthen fundraising for the benefit of artists and audiences across the country.  The Government will respond fully to the recommendations in all three reports in the new year.

Mrs Miller continued:

We have many generous donors in this country, without whom our arts and heritage would be poorer in every respect.  I am profoundly grateful for their support.  Together with public sector investment, earned income and support from the National Lottery, philanthropy has the potential to enable our cultural sector to continue to lead the world.  I share Matthew Bowcock’s desire to democratise philanthropy, and to make use of digital technology as one of the means to that end.

Thisreportis the third of three commissioned by DCMS Ministers to advance key elements of the philanthropy agenda.  Read the previous reports:

Matthew Bowcock makes ten recommendations in his report.

1 - Encourage the industry to collaborate to simplify digital giving systems.2 - Extend the Digital R&D fund3 - Introduce a matching scheme for online donations4 - Joined-up Government policy on philanthropy and giving

5 - Create a repository of shareware applications6 - Provide a digital education programme of case studies of best practice7 - Support the employment of “digital catalysts” in cultural organisations

8 - Develop, document and implement a digital audience engagement strategy9 - Recruit trustees with digital and fundraising skills10 - Encourage interdisciplinary cooperation on digital strategies, led by the Chief Executive and supported by the Board

Lord Inglewood, Chairman of the Reviewing Committee, said:

“It is very encouraging that, thanks to tax relief, institutions had to raise just under £9.3 million in order to purchase items worth over £29 million. This shows the benefits that can arise from the workings of a tax system which encourages the retention of treasures like these in this country. I would encourage the Treasury to look sympathetically and constructively at how the nation in the future can benefit even more from such schemes.”

Many valuable cultural objects over 50 years of age require a licence for export out of the UK. Where the object has been in the UK for 50 years or more, the Reviewing Committee review these items against thethree Waverley Criteriato assess whether the object is of national importance.

The Culture Secretary can then place a temporary export bar on item assessed as of national importance, giving institutions or individuals in the UK time to raise the necessary funds to purchase it.

GBM will also supply volunteers who will help develop and deliver a new financial markets education programme to teach local schoolchildren about London’s financial history and the impact of financial markets on the social and economic climate.

“The partnership between RBS and the Museum of London is a fantastic example of business and culture coming together to make a positive contribution to the lives of young people,” Mr Hunt said.  “The Museum of London is a wonderful institution and thanks to the generosity of RBS, many more children will be able to use its world class resources to further their education.

Speaking at theOxford Media Convention, Mr Hunt said the initiative would offer communities a “new voice” and provide local perspectives directly relevant to them.

The Action Plan, which builds on theShott report published last month, proposes broadcasting the channels on Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) and displaying them prominently on the Electronic Programme Guide (EPG).

New and existing media providers have been invited toregister their interestby 1 March and come forward with suggestions on how a channel dedicated to local news and content could work best.

Mr Hunt said the goal was to award licences by the end of 2012 and for local TV to be “up and running” soon after.

“For consumers, what this will mean is a new channel dedicated to the provision of local news and content - one that will sit alongside other public service broadcasters, offering a new voice for local communities, with local perspectives that are directly relevant to them,” Mr Hunt said. “So I am inviting all potential providers to register their interest with my department by 1 March, with the formal process scheduled to begin early this summer.”

He added that the Government will not be prescriptive about the number of areas around the country that will be involved and will wait to see what commercially viable proposals come forward.

The Culture Secretary also told the conference that a thorough review of media and communications will be carried out, leading to a new Communications Act.

The new act will aim to allow the UK’s digital and creative industries to move to the next stage and play their fullest possible role in promoting competition, innovation and economic growth. Mr Hunt said Government would talk to industry about the key issues in the coming months and publish a Green Paper at the end of the year that will set out the full scope of the Bill."

Norfolk has been selected to pioneer anew approach to the roll out of superfast broadband, which will help ensure the smooth delivery of the county’s broadband scheme.

With the nationwide roll-out of superfast broadband already well under way, Government, Local Authorities and suppliers are keen to ensure that delivery is not hampered by any complications arising at individual locations. TheFast Startinitiative will see local representatives from all parties involved in the roll-out convene at the very beginning of the process, identify any concerns and agree a course of action.

“Norfolk is on track to double access to superfast broadband for homes and businesses, and by having these discussions now, we can help ensure that the people of Norfolk will receive all the benefits that superfast broadband has to offer at the very earliest opportunity,” saidVaizey.

The benefits of this new approach to the Norfolk pilot should become rapidly apparent, and Government will then look to adopt this scheme throughout the UK.

Norfolk has been selected to pilot the scheme as it is one of the first areas in the UK to procure its wholesale rural broadband infrastructure contract."

Bushy Park, The Green Park, Greenwich Park, Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens, The Regent’s Park including Primrose Hill, Richmond Park and St. James’s Park cover around 5,000 acres in London, and celebrate their 160th anniversary of free public access this year.

In aWritten Ministerial Statementto Parliament, John Penrose said that he intended to:

The Royal Parks will remain in Crown ownership, under the overall responsibility of the Culture Secretary.

John Penrose said:

“It is right and fair that Londoners have a greater say in how the Royal Parks in their city are run. For too long they have been managed by central government, with MPs from across the UK having the power to micro-manage what they do. It’s time to put this right.  Fortunately we won’t need primary legislation to do so and we will shortly be announcing the arrangements we will use to bring it about.”

London Mayor Boris Johnson added:

“London’s 8 Royal Parks are world-class attractions, brimming with historic and horticultural delights. It is vital that these precious assets are managed in a way that balances the interests of all those who enjoy them. We welcome this announcement confirming that Londoners and their elected Mayor will have a far greater and more direct say in how these crown jewels of the capital are run. This process is getting underway in a pragmatic and cost effective way.

“We will now work closely with all concerned to ensure a smooth and collaborative transition of responsibilities.”

Following advice from English Heritage, theApollo Pavilion, in Peterlee, County Durham, is now among the top five per cent of all listed buildings in England, Heritage MinisterJohn Penroseannounced.

The pavilion was completed in 1969 but was subjected to vandalism and neglect in the late seventies and the eighties. It escaped demolition and was refurbished following a grant from theHeritage Lottery Fund.

“This is a striking example of how abstract art and ‘brutalist’ architecture can come together to make a building that is quite unique, and all the more so now that it has been rescued from dereliction in a highly successful project supported by Lottery funding and driven by the commitment of local people,” Mr Penrose said.

Nick Bridgland, Designation Team Leader atEnglish Heritage, said: “Named in homage of space exploration, the pavilion showed the bold optimism of those building the new town of Peterlee. Designed by Victor Pasmore, one of Britain’s leading post-War artists, the pavilion is as much an abstract sculpture as it is a building, providing a focal point to the small park at the centre of the community.”

The listing means that the pavilion’s status will have to be taken into account in any future development proposals."

Addressing more than 100 hoteliers, businesses and tourism bodies from across the East Midlands, the Secretary of State hailed the region’s stunning natural beauty and great historical significance. He said there were big wins to be had in 2012 for the East Midlands, in particular its tourism industry.

He also revealed that the region would feature in major international and national marketing campaigns to promote UK tourism in 2012 and urged local tourism firms to sign up to a new 20.12 per cent discount scheme.

The event, which was hosted by Derek Brewer, Chairman ofExperience Nottinghamshire, showcased the business, tourism, cultural and sporting opportunities that the Games bring.

Other speakers includedJohn Penrose(Tourism Minister),Deborah Hale(Torch Relay Producer at London 2012) andJames Berresford(Chief Executive ofVisitEngland).

Mr Hunt said:

“As the whole country cheers on Rebecca Adlington next year, I want them to know her home county with its amazing countryside is a stunning place to visit for a holiday.  With the Torch Relay going right through Sherwood Forest and the Peak District, we have a chance to tell the world about the treasures in this part of the country - and will do so with our biggest-ever tourism marketing campaign”.

VisitEngland’s Chief Executive, James Berresford said:

”I’m delighted to be here in the East Midlands with the Secretary of State, Jeremy Hunt, and Tourism Minister John Penrose.  This exciting tourism roadshow launches England’s most high profile campaign to boost domestic tourism and is designed to highlight the fantastic experiences Britons can enjoy literally on their doorsteps.

“2012 offers the tourism industry a number of unprecedented opportunities.  Not only will England be showcased to billions of people all over the world, but we have the opportunity to grow domestic tourism by inspiring Britons to rediscover England and take a holiday at home next year. Spear-heading the promotion will be a high profile TV campaign and specially devised discounted offers. Our job as the national tourist board is to work with the industry to harness the pride we know is felt by local residents and to inspire them to act as ambassadors for their destinations for next year and beyond.”

Derek Brewer, Chairman ofExperience Nottinghamshire, said:

“We welcome the Secretary of State and the Tourism Minister to the East Midlands at a time when we have much to be proud of in our sporting and cultural offering. We are delighted to be hosting the event at Trent Bridge where Ashes Tests will be played in 2013 and 2015. We have a rich heritage, of which we are immensely proud, and considerable ambition and drive to attract more visitors to experience the best of our region.”

Mr Hunt, with Sports and Olympics Minister Hugh Robertson, also visited Ellis Guilford School and Sports College in Nottingham. They hosted a school sport summit, along with Nottingham native and Olympic cycling medallist, Bryan Steel.  At the event Mr Steel spoke about how sport was his inspiration and urged schools to sign up for the new School Games school sport competition.  Using the inspiration of London’s Olympics, the competition is helping to transform competitive sport in schools and get more young people playing sport. Pupils from the school’s dance group also performed at the morning’s business summit.

Mr Hunt added:

“The School Games will leave a real lasting legacy from London’s Olympic and Paralympic Games.  They will transform sport in school, bringing back competition and getting rid of ‘prizes for all’.  There is still time for schools to sign up for the competition, which will have its first finals in the Olympic Park next year.”

Mr Hunt’s tour today also included a visit to Nottingham Playhouse to see some of the cultural opportunities that are available in the city.

Bryan Steel, said:

“Through the School Games more young people will have the opportunity to go on to be the best they can be at sport. As a Sporting Champion I work with young people who grow in self-esteem and confidence because they set themselves competitive challenges and strive to meet them. Coming from a disengaged background and facing learning difficulties at the age of 14 the course of my life was changed by sport. I will be encouraging as many young people as possible to get involved in one of the sports competitions - I dare you to break new boundaries and mark your mark.  You never know it may change your life too!”

Mr Hunt’s visit to Nottingham today is the second in a series of events being held around the country to help all parts of the country make the most of the opportunities of the Games and to urge schools to sign up to the School Games competition.

Nottingham-born Bryan Steel is a former Olympic cyclist and is currently representing Sporting Champions, a Sport England initiative. He represented Great Britain at the 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2004 Olympics.  He holds a host of Olympic, World Championship and Commonwealth Games medals - in both team and individual competitions.

The annualPortable Antiquities reportandTreasure report, published today, show that 97,509 finds were recorded by thePortable Antiquities Scheme(PAS) in 2011 - eight per cent more than in 2010.

“It never ceases to amaze me that such incredibly important objects have survived in the ground for many hundreds of years, waiting to be found by everyday people,” Culture MinisterEd Vaizeysaid.

“Not only are these objects extremely exiting discoveries, but once reported as Treasure or recorded with the Portable Antiquities Scheme they have great potential to rewrite the history of this country, and enrich local and national museums.”

In July this year the ITV show Britain’s Secret Treasures highlighted some of the finds recorded through the PAS.

“The ITV series this year shows just how much these finds have captured the public’s imagination and changed our understanding of the past, said Neil MacGregor, Director of theBritish Museum. “It is a scheme which is envied the world over.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/culture-minister-launches-support-programme-for-libraries,Press release,Culture Minister launches support programme for libraries,A new support programme that will secure a place for public libraries at the heart of the Big Society was unveiled by Ed Vaizey today.,"Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport and Ed Vaizey",20 February 2012,"Speaking at the Remodelling Libraries Conference, Mr Vaizey launched a new, expert support programme led by the Museums Libraries and Archive Council (MLA) and the LGA Group (Local Government Association Group). They will work together to support councils as they adapt to the current economic challenge, helping them to deliver the key services valued by communities while driving down costs.

The programme will initially undertake intensive, proactive work with around 10 library authorities. The best learning from those projects will then be shared throughout the wider public library network so that everyone can benefit from the work.

The Minister reinforced the Government’s commitment to a high quality library service with a radical rethink in how it is delivered. He urged consideration of options including shared services, merging functions, staffing across authorities, support from volunteers or the use of other community buildings. New governance models and greater cooperation across library authority boundaries are already emerging, such as the London Library Change Programme, which estimates potential savings of £20 million simply through sharing best practice. Mr. Vaizey emphasised that the programme will not be a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach and is based on the principle that local services know their communities best and that the solutions should be owned and driven by councils.

The statutory Advisory Council for Libraries will be wound down via the Public Bodies Bill.

Mr Vaizey also announced - in collaboration with the Society of Chief Librarians - a public library promise to Race Online 2012, the campaign led by UK Digital Champion Martha Lane Fox, that the library network will  help half a million people gain digital skills by the end of 2012.

“Public libraries have a unique place in society where anyone can go without judgement to learn, read, access information, get online or find entertainment.  And the library service’s ability to reach out and engage with groups who might otherwise be on the outskirts of the community makes their role in the Big Society all the more vital.

“Today’s economic challenge means people need library services more than ever, to help them back to work, to access learning and as a central plank of community cohesion. So I am delighted that public libraries have promised to help half a million digitally excluded people become confident digital citizens as part of Race Online 2012.

“But to do all of this in a time of reduced public spending means fresh thinking on how services are delivered. That’s why greater leadership is so important, and why I am announcing a support programme for libraries- led by local government - to work with councils and spread learning throughout the library network. We need to ask tough questions, like whether there is scope for savings in reducing the number of library authorities through voluntary alliances. It’s precisely because I believe so strongly in the value of public library services that I want to secure a sustainable future in the challenging times ahead.”

“Libraries are fantastic sources of information, advice and support for the communities they serve. They provide internet access for anyone, in an environment that feels safe and secure. I am delighted that the Society of Chief Librarians has pledged that the library network will help half a million people gain digital skills by the end of 2012. That’s a major step on the road to getting all 10 million people in the UK who’ve never used the internet online, and I hope it will inspire more people to pledge to help people get online through raceonline2012.org. Thank you!”

“Library services are rising to the double challenge of improving services for customers and contributing to the difficult discussions as to how councils make major savings and changes.

“A collaboration between local and national government aiming to ensure the public has a library service fit for the changing times is very timely. We look forward to working together to ensure that the universal right to access to books, information and support comes out strongly, but delivered in locally determined, modern and innovative ways.”

“Here in Cumbria we have an excellent library service, one that has developed a reputation for innovation and delivering a high-quality customer service - often in sparse, rural locations. However, if the service is to maintain this reputation in future, it will need to meet the challenges now facing local government head on.

“We want a library service that properly meets the needs of 21st century society, and shows innovation in delivering more with less. This will involve changes and challenges. Cumbria is ready to play its part in the Government’s library initiative and help shape the libraries of the future.”

The exhibition brings together 44 musical instruments from the collections of theV&AandHorniman Museums, presenting the captivating story of European classical music from the 16th to 19th centuries.

Many of these instruments have fascinating individual stories: from connections to prominent historical figures and events to tales of skulduggery and deception. A highlight of the display is one of Antonio Stradivari’s iconic violins, an example of his virtuosic craftsmanship which remains highly prized by top musicians today.Louis, le Grand Dauphin of France- famously “Son of a king, father of a king, but never a king” - reputedly owned the ornate kit (a compact violin used for dance lessons) which forms part of the ‘Salon’ display.

Alongside the display of instruments, the exhibition sheds light on the history of the two musical instrument collections, from the great exhibitions of the Victorian era that both fed and inspired them, to the intriguing individual collectors themselves.

The exhibition was funded by a £65,000 grant from theMLA’sDesignation Development Fund.

Commenting on the joint exhibition, Janet Vitmayer, Director of the Horniman said “We are thrilled to be able to focus the Horniman’s curatorial expertise on these exceptional instruments from the V&A as they complement our own collections so well.

The support from the Department for International Development will challenge misinformation in South East Asia and Africa, which is then spreading worldwide, and direct people to the right advice to help stop the spread of the virus.

False claims and conspiracy theories have spread rapidly on social media, touting ‘cures’ like drinking bleach or rubbing mustard and garlic into your skin. These pose a serious risk to health and can speed up the spread of the virus, by stopping people taking simple practical, preventative steps like washing their hands.

DFID’s £500,000 support will go to the Humanitarian-to-Humanitarian (H2H) Network, which has extensive experience addressing the spread of misinformation during epidemics, for example following the 2015 Ebola outbreak.

The work of the H2H Network will complement UK initiatives by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and the NHS to tackle misinformation online.

International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said:

Misinformation harms us all. By tackling it at source we will help stop the spread of fake news – and coronavirus – worldwide, including within the UK.

H2H will work with partners BBC Media Action and Internews to create verified information in various languages to tackle specific mistruths spreading in South East Asia and Africa. Their work will also support journalists in these regions to write more accurately about the virus using information from the World Health Organization.

Support will also go to Translators without Borders, which monitors false information in various languages and translates validated content from WHO and other health agencies, and Evidence Aid which updates a database of research on diseases each day.

The initiative will analyse social media and online content to identify where the misinformation is coming from and how it is spreading – so victims of fake news can be sent the correct information and directed to official health advice.

H2H will also work with social media influencers – vloggers and bloggers – to help spread accurate health information and reach younger online audiences that are more susceptible to fake news.

Some of the social media influencers being engaged include:

Bianca Gonzalez, a health expert and YouTube vlogger from the Philippines with over 7 million followers on Twitter @iamsuperbianca

Dr Jahangir Kabir, a Bangladeshi health expert and popular TV presenter with over 1 million Facebook followers @DrJahangirkabircmc

@KlikDokter – An Indonesian health blog with over 4 million Facebook followers

Some of the more damaging mistruths being targeted include:

‘Miracle cures’ for the virus, such as drinking chlorine dioxide, an industrial bleach, or urine, eating garlic, gargling saltwater or spreading cow dung and mustard paste. In Myanmar, news websites have reported false claims supposedly from health officials, advising people to sleep next to chopped onions claiming this will “absorb the virus” or to drink ginger juice. It is also falsely claimed you cannot catch coronavirus if you have a mosquito bite. Scammers pretending to be health officials in Myanmar have been selling black pepper seeds as a cure.

Undermining health officials: In Tanzania, people have received a WhatsApp message claiming to be from the health ministry and telling them drinking warm water every few minutes will prevent infection. The exact same message has also appeared in French throughout West Africa, claiming to be from the Canadian Health Ministry. Messages like this are undermining the efforts of real health officials to contain the virus, damaging trust in official advice and confusing people.

Promoting violence: Rumours that the virus was created or spread deliberately have already led to reported attacks on Chinese nationals across South East Asia as well as in the UK. A video claiming to show Chinese officials shooting coronavirus victims and alleging tens of thousands were executed went viral on social media sites worldwide, after the celebrity sister of a prominent Bollywood actor in India shared them. The video was in fact edited from four completely unrelated clips, including one of Chinese police shooting a rabid dog.

Public Health England is regularly updating its advice on coronavirus, including how people can help stop the spread of infection.  Individuals are also being advised to call NHS 111 or contact the NHS dedicated 111 online coronavirus service if they are concerned about any symptoms or any contact they may have had with someone who might be infected.

The H2H Network consists of approximately 50 organisations, which provide specialist services to the humanitarian aid sector, including tackling fake news in the wake of disasters and epidemics. The H2H Network is supported by UK aid and hosted by the Danish Refugee Council (DRC). This support is a new allocation of UK aid support from the UK’s aid commitment.

The World Health Organization warned in February about an ‘infodemic’ of false information which risked worsening the spread of the virus

The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport earlier this week announced the creation of a new cross-Government counter disinformation unit bringing together expert teams to help provide a comprehensive picture on the potential extent, scope and impact of disinformation on coronavirus in the UK.

The DCMS-led unit will have regular and robust engagement with social media companies to monitor interference and limit the spread of disinformation.

NHS England has also partnered with social media sites and search engines to ensure that official health advice is shown in online searches about the virus, as well as to verify or remove accounts claiming to be from local health authorities

The new UK aid-backed initiative announced today will complement these efforts, by challenging misinformation beyond the UK, targeting the source of fake news spreading in and from Africa and South East Asia

Communications MinisterEd Vaizeytodaypublished a documentasking industry for information and views on where the not-spots are, the best approach to tackling them, the different infrastructure options and ensuring the chosen solution can be used by all mobile operators.

Mr Vaizey said: “Mobile phones have changed our lives.  In just a couple of years they have developed into a device we use to shop, watch films, access the Internet and spawned an entirely new industry dedicated to developing apps.

“But for as many as one in ten people a mobile is little more than an expensive paperweight in their own home.

“The Government is determined to provide the UK with the communications infrastructure we need to live, work and drive economic growth in the digital age.

“The views of industry experts will be invaluable in ensuring we use this £150million to bring mobile coverage to as many people as possible.”

Industry are being asked to respond to the questions in the document within 30 days so procurement can begin in spring this year, with users seeing the benefit from early 2013.

A separate question document will be published shortly to seek the views of Local Authorities and Devolved Administrations.

The investment will be used to deliver voice and basic text services to areas where there is poor or no coverage.  However we will seek to make any new infrastructure suitable for upgrading so it could be used for new services such as 4G.

More than 600 pages of guidance cut down to 50

Top headteacher given new role in Department for Education to improve discipline

Today the Department for Education announces new and clearer guidance for teachers on how they should deal with bad behaviour.

The Department is also appointing a new Expert Adviser on Behaviour - headteacher Charles Taylor - who has a track record in radically improving behaviour in some of the most troubled schools.

Behaviour in good schools is not a serious problem but overall it remains a big concern for parents. Evidence shows there is much to do. For instance:

Previous behaviour and search guidance was more than 600 pages long. It left teachers confused about their powers under the law. It also made it much harder for schools to have clear and effective discipline policies.

The Government’s new guidance is 50 pages long. It clearly sets out the roles and responsibilities for governing bodies, headteachers and teachers regarding behaviour and discipline. It unequivocally restores adult authority to the classroom.

The new guidance clarifies teachers’ powers. It makes clear the following:

The guidance also protects teachers from malicious allegations and strengthens their authority in the classroom. It makes clear:

The new Education Bill going through the Commons now will also:

Charles Taylor, the Department’s new Expert Adviser on Behaviour, is currently headteacher at the Willows School, a special school for children with behavioural, emotional and social difficulties in Hillingdon, West London. As a behavioural specialist for over ten years, he has taught every age group, from nursery to 16-year-olds, working in tough inner city primary and comprehensive schools.

His job is to make sure schools put Government reforms into practice and includes:

There are other aspects of Government policy concerning behaviour:

Education Secretary Michael Gove said:

Improving discipline is a big priority. Teachers can’t teach effectively and pupils can’t learn if schools can’t keep order. These changes will give teachers confidence that they can remove disruptive pupils and search children where necessary.

The appointment of a head of Charlie Taylor’s calibre shows how serious we are about dealing with this issue. He has an excellent track record in improving discipline in some of the most challenging schools in the country.

Charles Taylor, the new Expert Adviser on Behaviour, said:

I am passionate about improving behaviour in our schools and looking forward to my role in putting behaviour at the heart of all the work of the Department.

For far too long, teachers have been buried under guidance and reports on how to tackle bad behaviour. I am determined to make sure I help schools put policy into practice. I want teachers to be able to do their job without lessons being disrupted and schools to feel confident when they address behaviour issues.

Jerry Collins, Principal at Pimlico Academy in London, said:

Excellent behaviour must be the norm in every school if children are to learn in stimulating and challenging environments.

At Pimlico Academy every child is expected to behave in a manner that enables them to engage in an academically rigorous curriculum. All barriers to excellent behaviour are addressed through a no excuses culture and high level therapeutic support.

Other headteachers welcomed the new guidance and powers.

Peter Barnes, headteacher at Oakgrove School in Milton Keynes, said:

The proposals outlined by this Government to improve behaviour in schools show a determination to support teachers and education professionals in maintaining good discipline and order.

Reducing the bureaucracy surrounding school behaviour policies allows schools to control their own agendas and apply what works for them in their individual contexts. It is about placing decision making in the hands of those people best placed to make those decisions.

Dame Yasmin Bevan, headteacher at Denbigh High School in Luton, said:

Uncertainty and confusion create bureaucracy. We need to clear the decks because we’re currently drowning under the weight of all the guidance and regulations. If heads were able to have a clear list of what they have to do and read it would make the job much more attractive. Just hearing about the raft of things you think you need to do can be very off-putting for an inexperienced head.

Andrew Fielder, Principal at Sandy Hill Academy in St Austell, said:

I am delighted to see that the Government has responded so well to our concerns in dealing every day with complex disciplinary and behavioural issues in schools. These areas are getting harder to manage all the time.

The clarity that this document brings will help to reduce uncertainty in schools. It more clearly highlights rights and responsibilities. What we needed was concise, easily accessible support and guidance, not huge policy documents filled with copious amounts of prescriptive and largely irrelevant text. Whilst that may have ticked boxes at the centre, it provided absolutely no help to the schools grappling with some of the most extreme behaviour problems imaginable.

Charles Taylor has been a behavioural specialist for over 10 years. He has taught every age group, from nursery to 16-year-olds, working in tough inner city primary and comprehensive schools. He is currently the headteacher of The Willow, a special school for children with behavioural, emotional and social difficulties in West London. Within a year of joining, the school received an ‘outstanding’ Ofsted report. He also works as a freelance behaviour consultant, coaching teachers in behaviour management techniques, and holds regular workshops for parents. He lives in London and is married with three children.

The new guidance published today is subject to an eight week consultation and can be found on the Department for Education’sconsultation website. The consultation will close on 30 May 2011. The guidance will be revised again if the Education Bill is passed.

The athletes will go into local schools and sports clubs up and down the country as a condition of receiving Exchequer and National Lottery funding for the four years leading up to theRio Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2016.

Maria Miller said: “In schools and clubs across the UK our Olympic athletes will be dedicated to helping the next generation shine as they themselves have shone this summer.”

Weannounced in August that the elite sport body UK Sport will receive around £125 million a year of public money(Exchequer and Lottery combined) over the next four years, providing sports’ governing bodies with the certainty they need to put long-term plans in place to try to emulate, or even better, the 2012 medal haul achieved by British athletes at both the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Rio in four years.

The funding means Britain’s elite athletes are able to train full time and focus on performing at the top of their game in world-class competition."

The four items which have been acquired by British institutions for the public to access and enjoy are:

Lord Inglewood, Chairman of the Reviewing Committee, said:

It is very encouraging that, thanks to tax relief, institutions had to raise just under £9.3 million in order to purchase items worth over £29 million. This shows the benefits that can arise from the workings of a tax system which encourages the retention of treasures like these in this country. I would encourage the Treasury to look sympathetically and constructively at how the nation in the future can benefit even more from such schemes.

Most cultural objects over 50 years of age, and valued above certain thresholds, require a licence for export out of the UK, whether on a permanent or temporary basis. Where the object has been in the UK for 50 years or more, the Reviewing Committee, administered by Arts Council England, review these items against the three Waverley Criteria, which are used to assess whether the object is of national importance.

Where the Committee finds that an object meets one or more of the criteria, it will normally recommend to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport that the decision on the export licence application should be deferred for a specified period. The Secretary of State can then place a temporary export bar on the item, giving museums, galleries, libraries and private individuals in the UK time to raise the necessary funds to purchase it.

Between 1 May 2011 and 30 April 2012, eleven items were considered by the Reviewing Committee, seven of which were referred to the Secretary of State. The seven items cover a diverse range of fields, from fine art, to a draft score by one of Britain’s most famous composers. Four items were bought by public institutions. Matching funds could not be raised for paintings by Watteau, Guardi and an early 19th century Italian classical tripod (see notes to editors).

Alan Davey, Chief Executive, Arts Council England, said:

It is wonderful that these rare and beautiful objects have been saved for the nation and are available for everyone to enjoy.

This wouldn’t have been possible without the support of the Heritage Lottery Fund, The Art Fund and various other charitable trusts - and, of course, individual donations from people across the UK.

That so many individuals made donations shows the value that people in this country place on art and culture; that they believe our cultural heritage is something worth preserving and investing in.

Ed Vaizey, Culture Minister, said:

It’s fantastic that these four treasures are now on permanent public display in the UK and I congratulate all those involved in the fundraising efforts to keep them in Britain.  The export licensing system is a valuable tool in preventing items like these from disappearing abroad and ensuring they will be enjoyed for generations to come.

The Reviewing Committee is an independent body, serviced by the Acquisitions, Exports, Loans and Collections Unit (AELCU) of Arts Council England. The AELCU safeguards and enriches the cultural property of the nation by:

We are confident that despite the current economic climate, alternative bodies will be keen to take on the sponsorship of these museums, which will make excellent additions to their activities.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/broadband-roll-out-moves-into-top-gear,Press release,Broadband roll-out moves into top gear,Government plans get the green light from Brussels,"Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport and The Rt Hon Maria Miller",20 November 2012,"The Government’s plans to roll-out high speed broadband to every home and business in the UK were boosted, following a green light today from the EU.

The approval paves the way for the UK’s £530 million rural broadband scheme to start in earnest, meaning that work can commence laying the cables for local authority broadband projects all around the UK.  The programme is part of the Government’s commitment to deliver the best superfast broadband network in Europe.

Today’s decision follows a direct intervention from the Culture Secretary in Brussels last week, after several months of delay in Europe.

Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport Maria Miller said:

“Finally getting the green light from Brussels will mean a huge boost for the British economy. Superfast broadband is essential to creating growth, jobs and prosperity and the delay has caused frustration within Government.  Today’s announcement means that we can crack on with delivering broadband plans, boosting growth and jobs around the country.

“Britain is in a global race today. To succeed in that race we must have the infrastructure to match our aspiration, providing people who work hard with the tools they need to get on and prosper; this green light will benefit both businesses and communities across the UK.

“Our broadband plans are hugely ambitious - to connect 90 per cent of homes to superfast broadband and ensuring the rest have access to at least 2Mbps. The Government will not allow parts of our country to miss out on the digital age.”

State aid approval means that local authorities can now sign procurement contracts with contractors and begin delivery work on their new broadband infrastructure projects.   Broadband Delivery UK (BDUK) has planned a ‘pipeline’ of local authority projects which are currently going into procurement at a rate of approximately one a week.

The projects which will be affected first by this clearance, and whose residents will be the first to connect to superfast broadband, are Wales and Surrey. Projects in Cumbria, Rutland and Herefordshire and Gloucestershire are expected to follow shortly afterwards.

Cambridgeshire, Oxfordshire and Highlands & Islands are still progressing their procurements.  North Yorkshire’s project began implementation in July as it already has state aid approval. Lancashire’s project has completed procurement and is currently awaiting the Commission’s decision on its own separate notification of state aid.

A further eight projects are currently undertaking their procurements using the Broadband Delivery Framework (Norfolk, Suffolk, Wiltshire, Devon & Somerset, Northamptonshire, Kent & Medway, Lincolnshire and Hampshire).  The first four of these launched their invitations to tender at the beginning of July and are now nearing the point of agreeing a contract with their supplier.

Shropshire will launch its procurement next week.

All the remaining rural broadband projects are expected to complete their procurements by summer 2013.

State Aid refers to forms of assistance from a public body, or publicly-funded body, given to selected undertakings (any entity which puts goods or services on the given market), which has the potential to distort competition and affect trade between member states of the European Union.  The European Commission monitors and controls State Aid in the EU.  Member States are obliged to notify and seek approval from the Commission before granting State Aid. This gives the Commission the opportunity to approve or refuse to approve the proposed measure.

The Government allocated £530 million to help take superfast broadband to rural areas.  In August last year weannounced how much each English county had been allocatedto help roll-out superfast broadband.  Details of the progress being made by each local authority is availablehere.

The Government is also investing £150 million in creating ‘super-connected cities with 80-100 Mbps broadband and city-wide high-speed mobile connectivity.  In March the Chancellor announced the UK’sfirst ten ‘super-connected cities’as well as inviting applications to be part of a second round of cities.

DCMS defines ‘superfast broadband’ as broadband with potential headline download access speeds greater than 24 Mbps.

The market will provide superfast broadband to around two thirds of the country.  It is essential the whole country shares in the benefits of high-speed internet access.  The Government is providing additional funding to make it economically viable for telecoms companies to roll-out broadband to the whole of the UK.  Our investment will help provide 90 per cent of homes and businesses with access to superfast broadband and for everyone in the UK to have access to at least 2Mbps.

To help with the procurement process, BDUK has established a Framework Agreement with those suppliers who were willing and capable of delivering a local broadband infrastructure project.  Two suppliers, BT and Fujitsu, were appointed to the Framework on 29 June.  The Framework aims to provide a consistent approach for Local Bodies for the procurement of broadband infrastructure and in a way which can achieve State aid compliance.

Formally opened by Minister for Culture and the Creative Industries Ed Vaizey and Chief Executive of UK Music Feargal Sharkey today, the space will give young people the chance to develop their talents, confidence and skills through a range of music activities. The wide variety of opportunities range from instrumentation, vocal training, lyric writing, sound engineering and production, through to artist development and live performance.

The centre, in the St Ann’s area of Nottingham, is one of 14 rehearsal spaces opening across the country as part of the music rehearsal space scheme. The scheme was set up with a £500,000 fund from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and supported by the music industry. Instigated by Feargal Sharkey, the scheme has been supported by the Music Industries Association (MIA) whose members have provided cut price instruments.  Within the next few weeks, all 14 spaces will be up and running, and Government and industry will be working together to ensure their continued success.

Aimed at local teenagers and young adults aged 16-25, the spaces provide the opportunity to learn to play and rehearse with a range of instruments from turntables to violins, to use recording and production equipment, and experience live performance. And, as well as providing access to music facilities, the Nottingham centre is a gateway for connecting with local youth services and support and to make links to industry and education.

Ed Vaizey said:

“This new music rehearsal space in Nottingham is a great way to bring together young people from across the local community and to inspire and motivate them through music. This is a great example of the Big Society in action because the young people here are making decisions about what they want in their communities and taking a lead in running their own facility.

“I’m very grateful to UK Music for their help so far, and to the MIA and their members who provided the instruments and equipment at this and the other spaces at discounted prices.  This is a great example of what can be achieved when the private and public sectors collaborate.”

Feargal Sharkey said:

“I’ve always worked on the principle that, if a young person shows interest in banging a drum…then give them a drum.

“The rehearsal space scheme works on the same principle: give young people easy access to a range of music-making equipment, and they will use it. Nottingham will prove no different to spaces in Liverpool, Cornwall, Sunderland or Bristol, where nearly 450 have registered in the short time it has been open.

“For such a small investment, the impact is extraordinary. The spaces may provide a first step for the next global superstar or music entrepreneur. Or they may simply instil a young person with the confidence to think, ‘I can do this,’ and open doors to a career in the creative industries. Going forward, UK Music is committed to working with Government to develop the scheme into a fully-functioning network. And we’ll soon have 14 spaces up and running.”

CRS Studio Manager, Trevor Rose said:

“CRS seeks to realise the potential of young people through music. We are, therefore, tremendously proud to be selected as one of the national Music Rehearsal Space pilots and are grateful for the support given from DCMS, Nottingham City Council, and the music industry. We can now move forward positively to develop the musicality and life chances of Nottingham’s young people for many years to come.”

14 community music rehearsal spaces are being set up in England with £500,000 from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.  In Nottingham DCMS met the full cost of the musical instruments and equipment (£11,000) and paid £37,000 towards the cost of capital works. Nottingham City Council met the balance of the capital works through its Youth Capital Fund.

This initiative, which follows a recommendation made by DCMS’s Live Music Forum, has been supported by a range of partners including UK Music, local authorities, youth music organisations, and the music industry, including the Music Industries Association and their member companies who supported the scheme by providing cut price instruments and equipment.

The other 13 spaces are located in disadvantaged areas in Liverpool, Bristol (2 spaces) , Washington, Birmingham (two spaces), Coventry,  Hastings, Manchester, North and West Norfolk, Cornwall and Rotherham.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/businesses-to-save-millions-in-reporting-and-accountancy-fees,News story,Businesses to save millions in reporting and accountancy fees,Changes to accountancy and administration regulations could save millions of pounds in costs for small businesses.,"Department for Business, Innovation & Skills",6 September 2012,"6 Sep 2012

Currently, to be eligible for an audit exemption in the UK, small companies must be less than a certain size in terms of balance sheet and turnover.

The changes to regulations will align mandatory audit thresholds with accounting thresholds. This means small and medium-sized businesses will be able to obtain an exemption if they meet two out of three criteria relating to balance sheet total, turnover and number of employees. This change will allow 36,000 more companies to choose not to have an audit.

The new regulations are expected to come into force for accounting years ending on or after 1 October 2012.

Vince Cable said:

“Reporting requirements have become increasingly demanding and costly over the years. We listened to business, who made a strong case for reform, and I am delighted that we are now taking this opportunity to make audit more flexible and targeted.

“Tackling these problems will help save UK companies millions every year and free them up to expand and grow their business, which ultimately benefits the entire British economy.”

The Government will also exempt most subsidiary companies from mandatory audit, as long as their parent company guarantees their liabilities. A further 83,000 subsidiary companies will benefit.

In addition, another 67,000 dormant subsidiaries will no longer need to prepare and file annual accounts, provided they receive a similar guarantee.

The new regulations will remove EU gold-plating and ensure UK SMEs are not at a disadvantage compared to their European competitors.

These changes are part of the Government’s wider drive to reduce unnecessary burdens and make the UK one of the best places in the world to start, finance and grow a business.

Commenting on the launch of his review, Doug Richard said:

“No matter who I speak with, everyone agrees that apprenticeships are a good thing - but only when they are ‘true’ apprenticeships.

“With the myriad of learning experiences which are currently labelled as apprenticeships, we risk losing sight of the core features of what makes apprenticeships work so my conclusion is that we need to look again at what it means to be an apprentice and what it means to offer an apprenticeship as an employer.

“Apprenticeships need to be high quality training with serious kudos and tangible value both to the apprentice and the employer. I want to hear about an 18 year old who looked at their options and turned down a place at Oxbridge to take up an apprenticeship if that is the right path for them. And I want to hear that their parents were thrilled.

“We need to make sure that apprenticeships are the success story they deserve to be.”

The government has welcomed the report. Business Secretary Vince Cable said:

“Doug Richard’s review echoes the Government’s current thinking on putting employers in the driving seat of our apprenticeship programme. This will be vital to ensure the skills of our workforce fit with employer needs.

“His recommendations will help us to build on the current successes of our apprenticeships programme and tailor a programme which is sustainable, high-quality and meets the changing needs of our economy in the decades to come”."

The funding will help create around 80 new jobs at the David Brown factory thanks to the funding programme which sees government and the private sector working together to boost regional growth.

The Deputy Prime Minister and Business Secretary visited the factory today to sign the legal contracts that will deliver the money. This follows a period of strict checks by the company and the government to ensure the deal offers the best value for money for taxpayers.

The Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said:

“Not only is it great to be announcing new jobs here in Huddersfield today, but it’s fantastic that David Brown is using the Regional Growth Fund to scale its operations up and out into the new and growing ‘green’ market.

“Creating jobs and growth is our number one priority for Britain right now.

“But it’s not enough just to get us back to where we were. There can be no forgotten areas of Britain. We need to rebalance the economy by supporting growth in every region and across a range of industries. That’s what the Regional Growth Fund is all about.”

David Brown Gear Systems,which is a leading manufacturer of gear systems including those for submarines and trains, will use the funding to extend its reach into the renewable energy market, stepping up production of special gears for wind turbines by creating a wind turbine research and development innovation centre. David Brown will be investing around £2.8 million in addition to the government funding.

Vince Cable also visited the University of Huddersfield for the official opening of theEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Advanced Metrology.

This was established earlier this year when EPSRC awarded funding of £4.7 million to the University’s globally-renowned Centre for Precision Technologies. A consortium of leading UK firms and organisations including Rolls Royce and David Brown Gear Systems, contributed a further £3 million.

The Centre has embarked on a five-year project bringing together leading researchers and businesses. The result will be that companies will be able to fit their existing machine tools with devices that ensure almost total accuracy during manufacture, saving money and improving efficiency.

Vince Cable said:

“This is a great boost to the economy in Huddersfield. The investment of £2 million announced today for David Brown and the support for the Centre of Innovative Manufacturing will help businesses in the area expand their capabilities.

“Support of this kind is vital if we are to help businesses create jobs where they are most needed and lever in important private sector investment. I’m looking forward to making more announcements of this kind in the coming weeks.”"
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-equality-advisory-and-support-service-is-launched,Press release,New Equality Advisory and Support Service is launched,A new advisory service that provides a range of help for people who feel they have been unfairly discriminated against was formally launched,"Government Equalities Office, Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport and Helen Grant OBE MP",15 November 2012,"A new advisory service that provides a range of help for people who feel they have been unfairly discriminated against was formally launched today by Minister for Women and Equalities Helen Grant.

The Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS) is designed to offer bespoke advice and targeted support on issues of discrimination to those who need it most.

Individuals from across the UK can already access help and information from a range of expert advisory services including Citizens Advice and Acas, but where appropriate these organisations will refer more complex cases to the EASS for further tailored assistance.

Where possible the new service seeks to resolve issues informally, but can also offer referrals to mediation or conciliation services, or help to start a legal claim if necessary.

Helen Grant said:

“Discrimination has no place in modern society, but sadly we know it still exists.

“It’s vital that people experiencing unfair treatment can access the right help and support to resolve issues quickly.

“The EASS offers a range of targeted assistance with a focus on seeking informal solutions wherever possible. Over the first month the new service has received numerous calls and I would like to thank all our partners for their help in supporting this important service, which I hope will go from strength to strength.”

Sitel, the leading global provider of customer care services, was awarded the contract for providing the EASS, which has been operating since 1 October.

Lawrence Fenley, Sitel’s General Manager for UK and Ireland said:

“We are delighted to be delivering the EASS, and to be able to provide support to victims of discrimination, when they need help understanding their rights and assistance in dealing with complex and sensitive issues.

“Our approach from day one has been to work with key partners from the voluntary and not for profit sector, such as Disability Rights UK and Law Centres.

“This gives us a depth of knowledge and links to other community and support organisations, enabling us to provide information on complex areas of legislation and support within a network of partner organisations.”

The EASS has been providing expert information, advice and support on discrimination to individuals in England, Scotland and Wales since 1 October. It is an improvement over the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) helpline it replaces, with longer opening hours, providing more active help and significantly better value for money.  It focuses on prevention and informal resolution wherever possible.  Where this is not possible or what the client wants, the new service offers referrals to mediation or conciliation service.  For clients who need or want to seek a legal solution, it will help establish if they are eligible for legal aid and if not, help them find an accessible legal service, or to prepare and lodge a claim themselves.  It is open 9am to 8pm Monday-Friday and 10am to 2pm on Saturday.  It is free to phone from landlines and soon from most mobiles.  For details of how to contact the service please see theEASS website.

From its work it will assemble evidence about discrimination problems, for example trends over time or spikes in particular types of case, and share this with the EHRC, Government and more broadly within the advice and wider voluntary and community sectors.

The EASS was set up following a Government review of information, advice and support on equality and human rights, which was published in March 2011. The review concluded that Government should continue to fund information and advice to potential victims of discrimination and human rights breaches and so it decided to commission a new service.

Following a procurement process carried out under EU rules, the contract to provide the EASS was awarded to Sitel. Sitel will work with Disability Rights UK, the Law Centres Federation, Voiceability, the British Institute of Human Rights and the Royal Association for Deaf People.

Further background information is available on theGovernment Equalities Office website.

An event at the headquarters of Disability Rights UK on 15 November marks the launch of the new service and brings together senior management from the key organisations/ representatives within the advice, pro bono and public sector. The event will highlight strategic direction and foster further cooperation and joint working on discrimination and human rights issues.

Women have traditionally benefited from lower car insurance premiums compared to men, however the move will effect everything from pensions to car and life insurance.

“This change from Europe is disappointing especially in these tough times when budgets are stretched,” said Minister for Consumer Affairs and Minister for EqualitiesJo Swinson.

“Insurers have no choice but to comply with the European Court of Justice’s ruling, but it means that for car insurance women are likely to face higher premiums and it could hit young women drivers particularly hard. So my message to women is simple: don’t take this lying down. Do your homework, shop around and nail the best deals. For motor insurance, new drivers might also consider taking extra qualifications like Pass Plus which can build driving confidence and cut insurance costs, and telematics policies which reward good driving behaviours with lower premiums.”

TheAssociation of British Insurers(ABI), has already been working with the insurance industry to  ensure  consumers are aware of the changes and what they should do to ensure they pick the right deal. TheABI’s guidanceexplains the changes and provides helpful tips and advice to help consumers including:

Jo Swinson continued: “We’ll be keeping a very close watch on this over the coming months to make sure the insurance industry is doing everything it should to ensure it minimises the impact for customers. I spoke with the Association of British Insurers earlier this week to urge their members to ensure consumers do not get a raw deal. We agreed to meet in three months to discuss the changes once we can see the impact of this ruling.

Leaked oil can end up in drains, many of which lead directly to rivers, streams, lakes and even garden ponds, having the same effect as pouring it directly into the watercourse.

Oil is poisonous to fish and other wildlife and smothers plants.  Just 2 litres of oil could seriously pollute the volume of fresh water needed to fill an olympic-size swimming pool.

Senior Environment Officer Brian Grant said:

Heating oil can cause serious problems if it gets into the environment. But it’s not just the cost of losing the oil that can be expensive, clean up costs can be large and are not always covered by household insurance policies.

This is why it is vital that oil is only ever stored in tanks that are in good condition. Both the tank and pipe work should be regularly inspected and people should never buy more oil than they can safely store.

Householders with domestic oil tanks should take the following action to ensure they are safe for use:

To report an oil spill or leak, people should contact the Environment Agency’s 24-hour emergency hotline on 0800 807060."

The new bank will aim to attract private sector funding so that when fully operational, it could support up to £10 billion of new and additional business lending.

The Government will build a single institution that will address long-standing, structural gaps in the supply of finance,identified in Tim Breedon’s report on non-bank finance.

It will bring together in one place Government finance support for small and mid-sized businesses. It will also control the Government’s interests in a new wholesale funding mechanism which will be developed to unlock institutional investment to benefit small businesses.

Vince Cable said:

“For decades British industry has lacked the sort of diverse, long-term finance that is quite normal elsewhere. We need a British business bank with a clean balance sheet and a mandate to expand lending rapidly and we are now going to get it.

“Alongside the private sector, the bank will get the market lending to manufacturers, exporters and growth companies that so desperately need support. It will be a lasting monument to our determination to reshape finance so it can finally serve industry the way it should. Its success will not be the scale of its own direct interventions but how far it shakes up the market in business finance and helps to ease constraints for high-growth firms.

“Having a functioning, diverse supply of finance is an integral part of the Government’s industrial strategy. It is all about making the right decisions now to secure our long-term industrial success.”

The bank will operate at arms-length from Government. It will be professionally run and commercially focused. It will facilitate the provision of loans, including long-term capital, to UK firms through banks and other financial institutions. By harnessing the power of capital markets, it has the potential to transform business finance in the UK.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/november-london-2012-olympic-and-paralympic-budget-report-published-anticipated-final-cost-down-29m--2,News story,November London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic budget report published - Anticipated final cost down £29m,The London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games remains on time and within budget.,"Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, The Rt Hon Hugh Robertson and The Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt MP",9 November 2010,"As part of the Government’s Spending Review settlement the final cost of the ODA programme has been reduced by £20m. This has been achieved through the removal of the Stadium ‘wrap’ and efficiency savings.  The overall public sector funding package for the Games remains at £9.298bn.

Figures from the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games Quarterly Economic Report show a decrease of £29m in the Anticipated Final Cost (AFC) of the part of the Games being delivered by the ODA - from £7.261bn in June to £7.232bn in September 2010. This includes the savings of £20m identified as part of the Spending Review settlement.

The ODA has also announced today that the roof of the 7000 seat Handball arena is complete with work underway on the copper cladding.

Minister for Sport and the Olympics, Hugh Robertson said: “The ODA has continued to drive down costs and deliver savings despite this being the most complex year in construction terms. The saving of £20m identified in the Spending Review has been achieved with little material impact to the programme.”

Olympic Delivery Authority Chief Executive, David Higgins, said: “This report shows that we continue to be on time and within the budget set by the Government. We have made savings as part of the Spending Review process without jeopardising successful delivery and in total have now saved over £750m since the start of the project to keep us on track. Today we are announcing that the roof of the Handball Arena is complete and across the rest of the Olympic Park progress is very visible with the Velodrome set to be the first new venue on site to be finished early in 2011. With 75% of the programme to Games-time now finished we are in the home straight but are not complacent and are focused on maintaining progress in the months ahead.”

In total around £750m in savings have been achieved by the ODA since the November 2007 baseline budget was agreed. The majority of these savings have been used to control the budget by offsetting cost increases in other areas of the programme and helping to fund the impacts of the credit crunch, thereby reducing calls on the contingency.

The changes in the Anticipated Final Cost (AFC) are as a result of:

a reduction in forecast costs of £20m on the Main Stadium including anticipated savings of £7m from not proceeding with the ‘wrap’;

forecast reduction of £33m in transport capital projects and a increase of £24m in transport operating expenditure;

potential cost increase of £11m on the Aquatics Centre to ensure the project remains on time and to standard;

potential cost increase of £8m on Stratford City Land and Infrastructure for payments due to the London Development Agency as part of the Compulsory Purchase Order process and some additional infrastructure works, including a new pedestrian bridge; and

forecast cost increase in Performance Management to CLM of £10m due to the strong progress of the project against agreed milestones and savings achieved.

Contingency funding totalling £39m was released during the last quarter to enable the ODA to enter into contractual commitments for early security works as part of the Park Operations proposals, generating efficiencies in procurement. It also covered additional security facilities around the Park, the areas between the site and the Westfield Shopping Centre, and for security of IT systems.

The gross allocation of contingency on the programme as of 30 September was £829m. There is £1,143m of contingency available - more than the value of assessed risks. Contingency funds will be required to fund the Park Operations work following the finalisation of the business case.

From April 2011, as a result of the Spending Review settlement, around £0.5bn of the funding package will be held as contingency for cross-programme issues. This reflects the programme’s changing focus from construction to operational requirements. This is in addition to the Programme Contingency that forms part of the ODA’s budget.

Hugh Robertson, added: “The ODA’s management of the construction programme has allowed us to open-up the funding package and contingency for cross-programme issues as we enter the operational phase.”

Preparation of the venues and infrastructure in the Olympic Park for the Games is almost 75 per cent complete. The ODA has hit all of its build milestones to date including the Velodrome and Aquatics Centre structures and roof. All venues are on track to meet scheduled handover dates to LOCOG.

Notes to Editors

A copy of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games Quarterly Economic Report November 2010 is available on theDCMS website.

This report covers the period 1 July 2010 - 30 September 2010.

The public sector funding package for the Games announced in March 2007 was £9.325 billion. Of this £6.1 billion was identified as the Olympic Delivery Authority budget, with around £2 billion contingency and £1.2 billion for non-ODA activities such as wider security and support for elite and community sport. On 24 May 2010 the Government announced that the ODA will make £27m of in-year savings from the current financial year taking the public sector funding package to £9.298bn.

As reported since the February 2010 Annual Report, it has been agreed that the ODA will take on additional responsibilities for the operation of the Olympic Park and its venues and facilities between 2011 and the handover to legacy owners by 2014. This includes Facilities Management, logistics and access arrangements and security. The ODA has estimated that the additional cost of this work would be up to £160m depending on the finalisation of scope, delivery approach, procurement and other factors. A business case has now been prepared and is expected to be approved next month.

The 7,000-seat Handball Arena is on track for completion next spring. New images show the unique roof - fitted with 88 ‘sun-pipes’ that use daylight to naturally illuminate the field of play - as complete, and the glass concourse level edging towards the finishing line. Work is also underway in cladding the top section of the venue with 3,000sq m of copper with a high recycled content. The arena, which has retractable seating in the lower tier for flexibility during Legacy mode, will host men’s and women’s preliminary stages and the women’s quarter finals for the Handball competition, the Fencing Discipline of the Modern Pentathlon, and will also be the stage for Goalball during the Paralympic Games. The latest images of the London 2012 Handball Arena can be downloaded from theGettyImages website.

The High Priestess of the Temple of Hera in Ancient Olympia used a parabolic mirror to capture the sun’s rays and light the Flame.

British-born Greek swimming champion Spyros Gianniotis was the first to carry the Flame, before passing it to 19-year-old Londoner Alex Loukos, who was one of the youngest representatives of London’s Olympic bid team in Singapore in 2005.

After an 8-day relay around Greece, the Flame will arrive at the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens next Thursday evening for the Olympic Flame Handover Ceremony. It will then travel to the UK before theLondon 2012 Olympic Torch Relaybegins on Saturday 19 May.

Jacques Rogge, President of the International Olympic Committee, said: “As the Olympic torch receives the flame and is held aloft by the first Torchbearer, we are reminded through its light of the Olympic values of excellence, friendship and respect that it carries on its journey. The London 2012 Olympic Torch Relay will celebrate those values, as it tours the country that invented modern sport and the spirit of fair play. It will also celebrate the many inspirational Torchbearers.”

Olympics MinisterHugh Robertson, said: “This is a significant moment in our journey to the 2012 Games. Lit in a ceremony steeped in tradition, it is exciting to think that in just eight days the Olympic flame will arrive on our shores for a Torch Relay that I hope the whole country will embrace.”

The 70-day Olympic Torch Relay will take the Flame on an 8,000 mile journey around the UK until it reaches the Olympic Stadium on the evening of 27 July 2012. The relay will pass within 10 miles of over 95% of the UK population."

They were taking part in‘Work No.1197: All the bells in a country rung as quickly and as loudly as possible for three minutes’, a performance coordinated by Turner Prize-winning artist Martin Creed to herald the first day ofLondon 2012and welcome the competing nations.

In London,Big Ben was rung more than 40 times, believed to be the first time that it has been rung outside its regular schedule since 15 February 1952, when it tolled every minute for 56 strokes from 9.30am for the funeral of King George VI. The National Assembly for Wales, Stormont and the Scottish Parliament rang their bells, so that all four bodies tolled in unison.

Artist Martin Creed said: ‘It’s by people and for people. On the morning of the opening of the Games it’s a massive signal that something is happening.’

Across the UK, people rang schools bells, church bells, town hall bells, bicycle bells and door bells. Organisations that registered to take part also included: the Royal Navy, British Embassies worldwide, the Mayor of London, the Archbishop of Westminster, The Girl Guides Association, the RAF and the British Army.Culture Secretary Jeremy Huntrang bells on the deck of HMS Belfast, on the Thames.

The work is part of the London 2012 Festival, a spectacular 12-week nationwide celebration running until the end of the Paralympic Games on 9 September.

Ruth Mackenzie, Cultural Olympiad and London 2012 Festival Director, said: ‘The commission shows the Festival’s commitment to world-class artists and to the values of participation. Martin Creed’s wonderful idea gets everyone involved in the opening day of the Games - not just as an audience, but as an integral part of the work.’

Now a swathe of this red tape is to be swept away, clearing the way for the economic growth and for the UK to have the fastest broadband of any major European country.

Under the new plans:

broadband street cabinets and other infrastructure can be installed without the need for prior approval from the local council (except in Sites of Special Scientific Interest)

broadband companies will face less cost and bureaucracy in laying cables in streets

broadband cables and cabinets can be installed on or under private land without the bureaucratic burden of long-running negotiations

The Government will also work with mobile operators, local government and other interested parties to consider ways that the planning process might be streamlined to speed up the deployment of mobile infrastructure.

We will also facilitate discussions between broadband infrastructure providers, power companies and the regulator Ofgem to develop a national contract for providing broadband infrastructure with a power supply.

Secretary of State for Culture, Media and SportMaria Millersaid:

“Superfast broadband is vital to secure our country’s future - to kick start economic growth and create jobs.  We are putting in the essential infrastructure that will make UK businesses competitive, and sweeping away the red tape that is a barrier to economic recovery.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/jmw-turner-s-final-masterpiece-of-the-eternal-city-modern-rome-campo-vaccino-under-threat-of-permanent-export--2,Press release,"JMW Turner’s final masterpiece of the Eternal City, Modern Rome – Campo Vaccino, under threat of permanent export",Culture Minister Ed Vaizey has placed a temporary export bar on a highly significant Turner masterpiece.,"Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport and Ed Vaizey",3 November 2010,"This will provide a last chance to raise the money to keep the painting in the United Kingdom.

The Minister’s ruling follows a recommendation by the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest, administered by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA).

The Committee has judged the painting to be of outstanding aesthetic importance, closely connected with the UK’s heritage and culture.

The Committee awarded a starred rating to the painting meaning that every possible effort should be made to raise enough money to keep it in the country.

Modern Rome - Campo Vaccino, was Turner’s culminating image of Rome, the last work to emerge from his long fascination with the city. The painting, which depicts a panorama of the Eternal City from the Capitoline Hill, across the Forum and into the distance, was painted in 1839, a decade after Turner returned to England from his second and last visit to the city. From the shimmering mist enveloping the city, temples, churches and monuments come into view, revealing a magisterial panorama of the city through a dazzling rendering of Italian light and atmosphere.

This highly significant painting, in excellent condition, has only been in two private collections since it was painted, and until recently was on long-term loan to the National Gallery of Scotland, where it played a vital part in the displays of Romantic and 19th century painting.

Lord Inglewood, Chairman of the Reviewing Committee, said:

If one needed evidence of Turner’s greatness as an artist, this is it. Modern Rome - Campo Vaccino is an astonishingly beautiful painting that underlines Turner’s thoughts and experiences of Rome, and in turn it has played a fundamental part in forming our perception of Turner and his work. Whilst this country holds a good part of the artist’s oeuvre, there are very few of his paintings in this country of this quality and in such fine condition. In addition in a single painting it sums up Northern Europe’s centuries old attitude towards the Mediterranean and the Classical World and its seduction by them.

The decision on the export licence application for the painting will be deferred for a period ending on 2 February 2011 inclusive. This period may be extended until 2 August 2011 inclusive if a serious intention to raise funds with a view to making an offer to purchase the painting at the recommended price of £29,721,250 [excluding VAT (£30,284,968.75 including VAT)] is expressed.

Offers from public bodies for less than the recommended price through the private treaty sale arrangements, where appropriate, may also be considered by the Culture Minister.  Such purchases frequently offer substantial financial benefit to both parties by the sharing of tax advantages.

Anyone interested in making an offer to purchase the painting should contact the owner’s agent through:

Notes to Editors

The moon is up, yet it is not night,The sun divides the day with her.

Byron was Turner’s favourite modern poet, whose words seemed to compliment his pictures and from whom he often took epigraphs. While responding to the dualism of mood implied by Byron’s lines, Turner’s changes from the original line ‘sunset divides the sky…’ to ‘sun’ and ‘day’  times the picture to morning rather than evening, suggesting rebirth rather than decline.6.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/culture-minister-launches-support-programme-for-libraries--2,News story,Culture Minister launches support programme for libraries,A new support programme that will secure a place for public libraries at the heart of the Big Society was unveiled by the Culture Minister.,"Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport and Ed Vaizey",20 February 2012,"Speaking at the Remodelling Libraries Conference, Mr Vaizey launched a new, expert support programme led by the Museums Libraries and Archive Council (MLA) and the LGA Group (Local Government Association Group). They will work together to support councils as they adapt to the current economic challenge, helping them to deliver the key services valued by communities while driving down costs.

The programme will initially undertake intensive, proactive work with around 10 library authorities. The best learning from those projects will then be shared throughout the wider public library network so that everyone can benefit from the work.

The Minister reinforced the Government’s commitment to a high quality library service with a radical rethink in how it is delivered. He urged consideration of options including shared services, merging functions, staffing across authorities, support from volunteers or the use of other community buildings. New governance models and greater cooperation across library authority boundaries are already emerging, such as the London Library Change Programme, which estimates potential savings of £20 million simply through sharing best practice. Mr. Vaizey emphasised that the programme will not be a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach and is based on the principle that local services know their communities best and that the solutions should be owned and driven by councils.

The statutory Advisory Council for Libraries will be wound down via the Public Bodies Bill.

Mr Vaizey also announced - in collaboration with the Society of Chief Librarians - a public library promise to Race Online 2012, the campaign led by UK Digital Champion Martha Lane Fox, that the library network will help half a million people gain digital skills by the end of 2012.

“Public libraries have a unique place in society where anyone can go without judgement to learn, read, access information, get online or find entertainment.  And the library service’s ability to reach out and engage with groups who might otherwise be on the outskirts of the community makes their role in the Big Society all the more vital.

“Today’s economic challenge means people need library services more than ever, to help them back to work, to access learning and as a central plank of community cohesion. So I am delighted that public libraries have promised to help half a million digitally excluded people become confident digital citizens as part of Race Online 2012.

“But to do all of this in a time of reduced public spending means fresh thinking on how services are delivered. That’s why greater leadership is so important, and why I am announcing a support programme for libraries- led by local government - to work with councils and spread learning throughout the library network. We need to ask tough questions, like whether there is scope for savings in reducing the number of library authorities through voluntary alliances. It’s precisely because I believe so strongly in the value of public library services that I want to secure a sustainable future in the challenging times ahead.”

“Libraries are fantastic sources of information, advice and support for the communities they serve. They provide internet access for anyone, in an environment that feels safe and secure. I am delighted that the Society of Chief Librarians has pledged that the library network will help half a million people gain digital skills by the end of 2012. That’s a major step on the road to getting all 10 million people in the UK who’ve never used the internet online, and I hope it will inspire more people to pledge to help people get online through raceonline2012.org. Thank you!”

“Library services are rising to the double challenge of improving services for customers and contributing to the difficult discussions as to how councils make major savings and changes.

“A collaboration between local and national government aiming to ensure the public has a library service fit for the changing times is very timely. We look forward to working together to ensure that the universal right to access to books, information and support comes out strongly, but delivered in locally determined, modern and innovative ways.”

“Here in Cumbria we have an excellent library service, one that has developed a reputation for innovation and delivering a high-quality customer service - often in sparse, rural locations. However, if the service is to maintain this reputation in future, it will need to meet the challenges now facing local government head on.

“We want a library service that properly meets the needs of 21st century society, and shows innovation in delivering more with less. This will involve changes and challenges. Cumbria is ready to play its part in the Government’s library initiative and help shape the libraries of the future.”

The NUT and NASUWT have asked teachers to follow 25 instructions including:

Head teachers have asked us for advice as they are concerned about the impact this is having on pupils’ education. International evidence shows that this kind of action can damage pupils’ attainment.

Many teachers have found that they need to pick up the work that other teachers should be doing. This is placing an increased burden on the very many hard-working teachers across the country who are not taking part in this action and are instead focusing entirely on providing the best education for their pupils.

Our advice makes it clear that teachers who are following the NUT and NASUWT’s instructions are highly likely to be in breach of their contract and therefore, depending on the circumstances, heads can reasonably deduct their pay.

As the Prime Minister has said, getting children back into school has been the government’s top priority. From 8 March all children and students will return to face-to-face education in schools and colleges.

This will be supported with a new £700 million package, focusing on an expansion of one-to-one and small group tutoring programmes, as well as supporting the development of disadvantaged children in early years settings, and summer provision for those pupils who need it the most.

A new one-off Recovery Premium for state primary and secondary schools, building on the Pupil Premium, will be provided to schools to use as they see best to support disadvantaged students.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:

Teachers and parents have done a heroic job with home schooling, but we know the classroom is the best place for our children to be.

When schools re-open and face to face education resumes on 8 March, our next priority will be ensuring no child is left behind as a result of the learning they have lost over the past year.

This extensive programme of catch-up funding will equip teachers with the tools and resources they need to support their pupils, and give children the opportunities they deserve to learn and fulfil their potential.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said:

Our package of measures will deliver vital support to the children and young people who need it most, making sure everyone has the same opportunity to fulfil their potential no matter their background.

I know that longer-term support over the length of this parliament will be vital to ensure children make up for lost learning. Our Education Recovery Commissioner, Sir Kevan Collins, will be engaging with teachers, school and college leaders and families over the coming weeks and months to develop our longer term plans.

The new recovery package for England includes:

A new one-off £302 million Recovery Premium for state primary and secondary schools, building on the Pupil Premium, to further support pupils who need it most. The average primary school will receive around £6,000 extra, and the average secondary school around £22,000 extra. This will help schools to bolster summer provision for their students, for example laying on additional clubs and activities, or for evidence-based approaches for supporting the most disadvantaged pupils from September.

£200 million (from the £300 million announced by the Prime Minister in January to expand our successful tutoring programmes). This will fund an £83 million expansion of the National Tutoring Programme for primary and secondary schools, which has been shown to boost catch up learning by as much as 3-5 months at a time; a £102 million extension of the 16-19 Tuition Fund for a further year to support more students in English, maths and other vocational and academic subjects; and £18 million funding to support language development in the early years – £10m to be allocated to a pre-reception early language programme and £8m for Nuffield Foundation to deliver the Nuffield Early Language Intervention for reception children.

£200 million (including the final £100 million from the Prime Minister’s announcement) will be available to secondary schools to deliver face-to-face summer schools. Schools will be able to target provision based on pupils’ needs but the government is suggesting they may want to initially target incoming year 7 pupils. This is alongside wider support funded through our Holiday Activities and Food Programme across the country.

A range of high-quality online resources will be available for all teachers and pupils, starting from the summer term and throughout summer holidays. These will be provided by Oak National Academy, to help give pupils the confidence they are ready for the next academic year.

As part of the government’s commitment to develop a longer-term education recovery plan, Education Recovery Commissioner, Sir Kevan Collins, will lead the way on longer-term engagement work with teachers, school and college leaders, educational charities and families to review how evidence-based interventions can be used to address the impact the pandemic has had on learning.

Education Recovery Commissioner, Sir Kevan Collins said:

The National Tutoring Programme has already put us on the right path by enabling tens of thousands of young people to benefit from the high-quality support that tutoring offers.

We know that ensuring all children and young people can make up for lost learning will be a longer-term challenge, and the range of measures announced today are an important next step.

But this is just the beginning and I’ll be engaging with the sector, educational charities as well as families, to ensure this support is delivered in a way that works for both young people and the sector and to understand what more is needed to help recover students’ lost learning over the course of this parliament.

Professor Becky Francis, Chief Executive of the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) said:

School closures, as a result of the pandemic, have had a devastating impact on the poorest children and the youngest in society.

The evidence shows how tutoring can play a significant part in the education recovery, so it is great the government has committed to funding tutoring - including through the NTP - beyond this academic year. We hope it will have a long-term role in closing the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their classmates.

The NTP has been working with thousands of schools and children across the country during the latest school closures to deliver expert tutoring, and will continue to do so throughout the spring and into the summer.

Today’s package of support also follows the delivery of more than one million laptops and tablets to the most disadvantaged children and young people across the country, as part of a £400 million government investment that will support schools, colleges and young people for years to come.

A small event was held at the site, with members of the transgender and LGBT communities coming together to raise awareness. Flags were also raised as a mark of support.

Carl Lewthwaite, disability, equality and welfare adviser for Sellafield Ltd, said:

Sellafield Ltd and the supply chain have a large workforce with a diverse mix of skilled people, all working towards the same mission of cleaning up the UK’s nuclear legacy.

Equality and diversity is a key part of supporting, developing and retaining a skilled, agile and respectful workforce to get the job done more safely, quickly and cost effectively.

Events like today help to raise awareness among the Sellafield workforce and local community, so we can help build a culture that goes beyond tolerance, and develops into understanding, respect and acceptance of transgender colleagues, neighbours, and any ‘minority’ group.

The company has policies, procedures and support networks in place to drive forward diversity, equality and inclusivity. This relates specifically to the 9 protected characteristics outlined by the Equality Act 2010, one of which is gender reassignment.

Sellafied Ltd employee, Nicole Cowles said:

I’m very happy to work for a company who has supported my transition. I can be myself, which brings out the best of me, and without fear of being verbally abused, or put down.

It has given me the confidence to mix with the public at large, where I can lead as regular a life as I can.

There are still folk out there who do not understand the transgender issue, and I feel it is important to raise awareness, in the hope that one day it will be considered as acceptable as is possible.

Amanda Mckay, quality director for Balfour Beatty, attended the event at Sellafield. She said:

Transgender Day of Visibility helps to raise awareness of the trans community, many of who remain invisible in society. It highlights that trans people do still suffer discrimination both as individuals and as a community, but also that by being able to be themselves they can contribute to work, family and society in a more effective way."

Data from the Joint Biosecurity Centre and Public Health England has indicated a significant change in both the level and pace of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Luxembourg.

There has been a consistent increase in coronavirus (COVID-19) cases per 100,000 of the population in Luxembourg since the end of June, with over a tenfold increase in total cases over this time period.

As a result, ministers took the decision to remove Luxembourg from the travel corridor list of countries from which people arriving in theUKdo not have to self-isolate.

At the same time, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has also updated itstravel advice for Luxembourgto advise against all but essential travel to the country.

People currently in Luxembourg are encouraged to follow the local rules and check theFCOtravel advice pages for further information.

The government has made consistently clear it will take decisive action if necessary to contain the virus, including removing countries rapidly if the public health risk of people returning from a particular country and not self-isolating becomes too high.

The devolved administrations have all taken the same decision today, so travellers arriving from Luxembourg into all parts of theUKwill need to self-isolate.

The government is urging employers to be understanding of those returning from Luxembourg who now will need to self-isolate.

Travellers should always check thelatest advice from theFCO, given the potential for changing coronavirus infection rates to affect both the advice about travelling to other countries and rules about self-isolation on return.

All travellers, including those from exempt destinations, will still be required to show a completepassenger locator formon arrival into theUK.

The amending regulations and accompanying explanatory memorandum will be laid before Parliament, registered and published onlegislation.gov.ukas soon as possible on 31 July 2020."

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-government-welcomes-the-european-commissions-draft-data-adequacy-decisions,Press release,UK government welcomes the European Commission’s draft data adequacy decisions,The government welcomes the European Commission’s draft data adequacy decisions.,"Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport and The Rt Hon Oliver Dowden CBE MP",19 February 2021,"The government welcomes the European Commission’s draft data adequacy decisions, which recognise the UK’s high data protection standards and set out that the UK should be found ‘adequate’.

The UK has a world-class data protection system, currently the same as the European Union’s, so it is logical that the Commission should find the UK ‘adequate’.

The EU already recognises other countries around the world as adequate including Argentina, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland and Uruguay - and the UK freely exchanges data with these countries.

Positive data adequacy decisions under both the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Law Enforcement Directive (LED) would allow for personal data to continue to flow freely from the European Union (EU) and wider European Economic Area (EEA) to the UK.

Seamless international data flows are essential in a hyper-connected world. They underpin the exchange of information and ideas supporting trade, innovation and investment, assist with law enforcement agencies tackling crime, and support the delivery of critical public services sharing personal data as well as facilitating health and scientific research.

Technical confirmation of the draft adequacy decisions will help make sure UK businesses and organisations in everything from logistics to legal services, healthcare to human resources, can continue to receive personal data from the EU and EEA without additional compliance costs. This ensures they will avoid potential knock-on effects for consumers and boost UK startups and smaller firms which operate in EU markets and sell to EU customers.

The UK formally provided the Commission withcomprehensive explanatory materialnearly a year ago at the start of the adequacy assessment in March 2020. The UK has already recognised the EU and EEA member states as ‘adequate’, as part of its commitment to establish a smooth transition for the UK’s departure from the bloc and manage data flows on an objective basis.

Since then, UK officials led by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) have held a series of discussions with their European Commission counterparts to reiterate carefully and fully the UK’s legal and regulatory framework and demonstrate beyond doubt that the UK clearly meets the EU’s data adequacy requirements.

The draft decisions published today by the Commission will now be shared with the European Data Protection Board for a ‘non-binding opinion’, before being presented to EU member states for formal approval.

The UK made its representations to the EU in a timely manner but the Commission did not finalise draft decisions in time to complete the adoption process by the end of the transition period. For this reason, as part of the UK/EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement, a time-limited ‘bridging mechanism’ for personal data flows was agreed. This currently allows personal data to continue to flow as it did before the end of the Brexit transition period for up to six months, while the EU completes the adequacy process.

The UK government now urges the EU to swiftly complete this technical process for adopting and formalising these adequacy decisions as early as possible.

Secretary of State for Digital Oliver Dowden said:

I welcome the publication of these draft decisions which rightly reflect the UK’s commitment to high data protection standards and pave the way for their formal approval.

Although the EU’s progress in this area has been slower than we would have wished, I am glad we have now reached this significant milestone following months of constructive talks in which we have set out our robust data protection framework.

I now urge the EU to fulfil their commitment to complete the technical approval process promptly, so businesses and organisations on both sides can seize the clear benefits.

Julian David CEO of techUK said:

The European Commission’s decisions that the UK’s data protection regime offers an equivalent level of protection to the EU GDPR reflects the UK’s high data protection standards.

Today’s decision is warmly welcomed by the tech sector which has been making clear the importance of a mutual data adequacy agreement since the day after the referendum.

Receiving data adequacy, alongside the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, will set a solid foundation for digital trade with the EU, including strong non-discrimination clauses and positive data flows provisions, that will give businesses the confidence to invest.

The reopening of schools is a national priority. The Prime Minister recognises that school closures have had a huge impact on children’s learning and has pledged to work with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long-term plan to make sure pupils have the chance to make up their learning over the course of this Parliament.

Sir Kevan will lead this work. He is a prominent figure in education, having worked in the sector for over 30 years as a teacher, a Director of Children’s Services and most recently as Chief Executive of the Education Endowment Foundation.

In his new role, he will work with government to deliver measures that will support children who have missed out on face-to-face education due to extended school closures.

This will include addressing factors such as curriculum content and quantity of teaching time in the coming months, to ensure the impact the pandemic has had on learning is addressed as quickly and comprehensively as possible.

Earlier this month the Prime Minister committed to providing a huge programme of catch up, recognising that the disruption of this year has had a huge impact which will take more than a year to make up.

This will involve a further £300 million on tutoring programmes, building on last year’s £1 billion Covid Catch Up fund, as well as potential plans for summer schools developed in partnership with the education sector.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:

I am absolutely determined that no child will be left behind as a result of the pandemic.

Our top priority is to get schools open again and once they are, we will make sure that teachers and students are equipped with the resources and the time they need to make up for lost learning.

I am delighted that Sir Kevan has been appointed to lead this vital work – his experience and expertise will help ensure every young person is supported to catch up on their education and gain the skills and knowledge they need to be able to seize opportunities in future.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said:

Sir Kevan brings a wealth of experience in education policy that I know will be invaluable in supporting all the young people who have been impacted by the pandemic.

He will be a tremendous asset to those young people, their families, and everyone working in education who have my lasting gratitude for their efforts to support young people throughout the pandemic.

I look forward to working with Sir Kevan as we deliver our existing National Tutoring Programme that is already reaching tens of thousands of young people who need it most, expand our catch up provision for this year and work on the longer term recovery to make sure every young person has the opportunity to progress and fulfil their potential.

Sir Kevan will report directly to the Education Secretary and the Prime Minister, and will consult closely with parents, teachers and schools as part of his role.

While schools have been closed to the majority of pupils, the government has been doing everything possible to support children to learn from home. The Department for Education has purchased more than one million laptops and tablets for disadvantaged young people, supporting them to access remote education.

Oak National Academy was also set up last year and is backed by government – with 10,000 online lessons created by teachers available.

The government is due to set out further details on its approach to re-opening schools as part of its plan for leaving lockdown, which will be published in mid-February.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/global-award-for-sellafield-board-game,News story,Global award for Sellafield board game,A board game that has helped teams at the Sellafield nuclear site overcome real decommissioning challenges has won a global innovation award.,Sellafield Ltd,26 November 2016,"The ‘Synergy’ game was developed for Sellafield Ltd by Vulcain Engineering Ltd, a French company with an office in Phoenix Enterprise Centre, Cleator Moor and with team members from its partner company Oxand Academy.

It won the innovation category in the international Institute of Asset Management awards in London this week, having been up against Atkins and the National Grid.

The game is designed to help train the site’s asset management team and support decision-making relating to asset management. Judges chose ‘Synergy’ for its originality and the tangible benefits it has brought to the business.

Teams at Sellafield Ltd were actively involved in the design and development of the game, which sees them spend Sellafield-minted money worth millions of pounds, on a range of facilities and infrastructure. It helps them make decisions relating to buildings, infrastructure, IT systems, equipment, vehicles and many more assets.

Lucy Hughes, Asset Management Standards and Assurance Manager, has been pleased with the impact the game has had. She said:

Asset Management (AM) can be rather a dry, abstract subject for many people, often difficult to understand. This game provides an innovative new way of delivering training - we are always looking at new ways to be informed.

There are 4 teams and they start off working separately with their own team mates and then by the end they are working together. There is a lot of science behind, it is not just a game.

Simon Spencer, Vulcain Engineering’s Principal Consultant in Cumbria who has also worked at Sellafield, explained that there are lots of benefits to using board games as a training tool:

Synergy is about making fundamentals of asset management interesting and enjoyable to learn. In a PowerPoint presentation, on average you will only take in about 6% of the information on the screen, in a face-to-face conversation, it’s about 20%, but with a simulation or an activity based tool like this, it will be up to 75%.

The original asset management board game wasn’t created for the nuclear industry or for Sellafield, so we adapted it to better reflect the operational challenges and decision-making processes of a live site.

Synergy brings to life the processes needed for anticipating problems, allocating the right budget, reducing costs where possible and understanding the impact on performance, but also recognises that compromises are necessary.

The game is usually played by between 8 and 12 people from various staff levels around Sellafield. It usually takes about 3 hours to complete and has been received well by nuclear and asset management professionals."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-law-to-ensure-furloughed-employees-receive-full-redundancy-payments,Press release,New law to ensure furloughed employees receive full redundancy payments,"Government brings in law to ensure furloughed employees receive statutory redundancy pay based on their normal wages, rather than a reduced furlough rate.","Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, The Rt Hon Lord Alok Sharma KCMG, Paul Scully and The Rt Hon Nadhim Zahawi",30 July 2020,"Furloughed employees who are then made redundant will receive redundancy pay based on their normal wage, under new laws being brought in today (Thursday 30 July).

Throughout the pandemic, the government has urged businesses to do right by their employees and pay those being made redundant based on their normal wage, rather than their furlough pay, which is often less.

The majority of businesses have done so, however, there are a minority who have not.

Today the government will bring in legislation to protect workers and ensure all furloughed employees who are being made redundant receive their full entitlement.

Employees with more than 2 years’ continuous service who are made redundant are usually entitled to a statutory redundancy payment that is based on length of service, age and pay, up to a statutory maximum.

This legislation, which will come into force from tomorrow (Friday 31 July), will ensure that employees who are furloughed receive statutory redundancy pay based on their normal wages, rather than a reduced furlough rate.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma said:

The government is doing everything it can to protect people’s incomes through our Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which is now supporting over 9 million jobs across the UK.

We urge employers to do everything they can to avoid making redundancies, but where this is unavoidable it is important that employees receive the payments they are rightly entitled to.

New laws coming into force today will ensure furloughed workers are not short-changed if they are ever made redundant – providing some reassurance for workers and their families during this challenging time.

These changes will also apply to Statutory Notice Pay, which is where employees must be given a notice period before their employment ends, varying from at least one week’s notice up to 12 weeks’ notice, depending on how long they have worked for their employer. During this notice period, employees must be paid.

This legislation will also ensure that notice pay is based on normal wages rather than their wages under theCJRS.

Other changes coming into force will ensure basic awards for unfair dismissal cases are based on full pay rather than wages under theCJRS.

In March, the government established an unprecedented package of support for companies of all sizes across sectors, to protect businesses, jobs and incomes during the pandemic.

Through the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme and the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, more than one million loans have been approved.

We have also introduced a new Job Retention Bonus to encourage firms to keep on furloughed workers, with a one-off payment of £1,000 being provided to UK employers for every furloughed employee who remains continuously employed through to the end of January 2021."

Principal of Lakes College, Chris Nattress said:

We continue to have excellent relationships with Sellafield Ltd, linked to both skills and education and our wider socio-economic activity, which directly benefit our local communities.

Our recent collaborative work on the Big Rig here at the college, and the National College for Nuclear are great examples of how we work together to enhance opportunities for college students, partners, and the wider nuclear industry.

We look forward to another successful year during 2016/17.

The award was collected by Dr Donna Connor, Head of Education and Skills for Sellafield Ltd.

Dr Connor said:

I am proud to work for an organisation that helps all of its employees to realise their potential through training and education, whether those people have worked for the company for 40 years or for a couple of months as an apprentice.

We do that because it is the right thing to do, but to receive external recognition for our efforts in this vital area is an honour.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/savings-accounts-for-all-children-in-long-term-care,Press release,Savings accounts for all children in long-term care,"More than 55,000 of the most vulnerable young people in the UK are set to benefit from a new savings account, with an initial payment of £200, the Department for Education announced today.",Department for Education and Tim Loughton,1 November 2011,"Minister for Children and Young People, Tim Loughton, announced that the Government will open a Junior Individual Savings Accounts for every young person who has been in care for more than a year. The first accounts will be opened on behalf of looked after children in 2012.

The scheme, worth a total of £16.7m until 2015, will offer tax-efficient savings accounts that can be held in cash or shares and will mature and be accessible on the account holder’s 18th birthday.

Tim Loughton announced the Government will open accounts with an initial £200 payment and hopes individuals and organisations who want to invest in the futures of these vulnerable children will also contribute.

The Department believes the scheme benefits these young people in two ways:

Minister Tim Loughton said:

The best way to learn about the value of savings and investments is with real money in real accounts. Like any parent, the Government wants to provide the best support to children in its care and make sure they gain the same experience as any other young person.

The savings will help them when they reach 18 and they are facing serious choices as they start out in the adult world. I am confident that, when combined with financial education, holding a real financial asset in a savings account will encourage these young people to learn about how to manage their money well.

These children are some of the most vulnerable in our society and we are committed to investing in them so they can thrive. I want these savings to be worth much more than £200 by the child’s 18th birthday and I hope individuals and organisations will also want to use these accounts to contribute and invest in the futures of these vulnerable children.

The Department has worked closely with Action for Children and Barnardos in developing the scheme.

Chief Executive of Action for Children, Dame Clare Tickell, said:

For children in care, who have missed out on so much already, making their way in the world without the financial and emotional support of parents is incredibly daunting. We help young people to make that first step and start building a life for themselves; for many, leaving care means falling off a financial cliff edge, with no savings, support or safety net.

Not only will the new Junior ISA for children in care ease their move to financial independence, but it will help to show these vulnerable children that someone cares, and that someone is planning for their future. The scheme will help these young people with basic money management skills, and to plan for their future - offering the same opportunities as those young people not in care. It is a small amount that will make a big difference to those children who have often had a very difficult and troubled start in life.

Action for Children and Barnardo’s have been campaigning on this issue for a long time. Today’s announcement by the Government is a very positive step, and will help to ease the difficult transition from care to adulthood for many of our most vulnerable and neglected young people.

Barnardo’s chief executive Anne Marie Carrie said:

We are delighted that the Government listened to our call to ensure that children in care are given special support to ensure they enjoy the same life chances as other young people. The boost this money will give care leavers cannot be underestimated.  As the UK’s largest children’s charity we are also pleased that the scheme provides an opportunity for those wanting to give something back to society to invest in the futures of some of our most vulnerable children and young people.

Payments under the scheme, which was first announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 2011, are intended as a long-term asset that the child can draw on later in life. The Department is now considering the best way to provide financial education to these young people and their carers so they are prepared to make important decisions about how to use their money. The families and carers of looked after children may also choose to pay into the accounts.

Lee, care leaver aged 21, said:

When I left care it was a really daunting time - I was suddenly on my own and needed to work out how to live independently as an adult. I had to grow up fast. I was also really aware that I didn’t have any savings, and that limited the plans I could make. Just having a bit of financial support would have made a real difference. It would have helped me to stand on my own two feet, made me feel safer and less stressed, and I’m sure the new savings account will do just that for young people leaving care.

Rachel Rogers, participation worker for Action for Children’s Dorset Children’s Rights Service, said:

Leaving the care system can be very difficult for young people. They have to fend for themselves for the first time and, unlike their peers, they don’t have family to call on for either emotional or financial support. Having some savings to fall back on will give them a sense of security and will open up new opportunities as they plan an independent future. It will enable them to buy household items as they set up their own home or it will help with transport costs for college or work. These things really will transform the lives of most vulnerable young people in our society.

The Department for Education will be launching a competition to select the best partners to operate the scheme before the end of this year.  Potential partners will need to demonstrate they have the skills and experience to understand the financial needs of looked after children so they make the right investment choices for them.

The Government believes the scheme will give generous individuals and organisations the opportunity to channel financial support directly to those who are most in need, helping looked after children take the chances that may otherwise be denied them. The Department will also consider how potential partners will raise additional voluntary contributions to boost savings and distribute amongst looked after children.

This announcement comes on the day that Junior ISAs are launched.  From today, parents will be able to open a Junior ISA account for their children from a range of high street financial institutions.

Previously, some looked after children received additional financial support from the Government through Child Trust Funds (CTFs). The new scheme continues this support for all children who did not benefit from CTFs.  This includes those born after the CTF scheme was stopped, as well as older children who never benefitted from CTFs.

We estimate that around 55,000 children across the UK will benefit in the first year - most looked after children over the age of 10 who have been in care for a year or more, as well as very young children born after the end of CTFs.  We estimate a further 14,000 will become eligible in each subsequent year.  These numbers are estimates because exact numbers of beneficiaries will depend on future numbers of children in care.

The first payments will be made in 2012.  We expect to complete a competition to appoint the best partners to operate the scheme in early in 2012.  The appointed partner will open the accounts and make the payments The first accounts will be opened on behalf of looked after children in 2012.

The scheme is UK wide and the Government has made provision for looked after children in the three devolved administrations to receive these funds.  The same eligibility criteria will apply.

The final sum of the savings will depend on the rates of return provided by individual Junior ISAs, how old the child is when the account is first opened, the amounts of voluntary donations that the scheme partners can attract and any additional payments made into the Junior ISA by carers, parents or other relatives.

The reportOn Our Own Two Feet, published by Action for Children and Barnardo’s illustrates young people’s interest in such a scheme.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/academies-see-double-the-increase-of-other-maintained-schools-at-gcse,Press release,Academies see double the increase of other maintained schools at GCSE,"Information on academies’ GCSE results, which have improved by more than twice the level of other maintained schools.",Department for Education and The Rt Hon Nick Gibb,20 October 2011,"Only a fifth of pupils took the core academic GCSEs this year.

Figures out today reveal that academies’ GCSE results have improved by more than twice the level of other maintained schools.

The provisional GCSE results for 2011 show that:

The statistic for academies is based on the 166 sponsored academies with results in both 2010 and 2011. Their performance is particularly impressive as these academies replaced historically underperforming schools in deprived areas.

Schools Minister Nick Gibb said:

The government believes that teachers and head teachers know best how to run schools. Academy status gives professionals the freedom they need to do their job and today’s figures show that that autonomy works. Academies continue to outperform the national average, completely transforming previously underperforming schools serving some of the most deprived communities.

The government is turning around more underperforming schools than ever before. In May 2010 there were a total of 203 sponsored academies. Since then the coalition has opened 116 more sponsored academies. More sponsored academies will open this academic year than in the history of the academies programme. The government has also allowed good schools to take on academy freedoms. 1,031 schools have chosen to do so.

The results also show that just a fifth of pupils studied the core academic subjects that make up the English Baccalaureate (EBacc). Only one in six pupils managed to secure good grades in a combination of English, maths, a language, history or geography, and two sciences.

The provisional GCSE results for 2011 show that:

Ministers have been clear that all pupils, regardless of their background, should be given the opportunity to study the core academic subjects.

Research recently published by the Department for Education showed the huge positive impact the EBacc is having on future GCSE choices. Since its introduction, 47 per cent of pupils taking GCSEs in 2013 are now studying a combination of EBacc subjects.

The researched showed that, compared to entries in 2010, there is an increase in the percentage of pupils taking GCSEs in the EBacc subjects in 2013 by:

Schools Minister Nick Gibb said:

It is a scandal that four-fifths of our 16-year-olds did not take the core academic GCSEs that universities and employers demand - when far more are capable of doing so.

Parents across the country rightly expect that their child will receive a broad and balanced education that includes English, maths, science, a language and history or geography. Sadly, all too often it is the pupils from the poorest backgrounds who are denied this opportunity. Last year, only 4% of children from poorer backgrounds achieved the English Baccalaureate GCSEs, compared to 17% of their peers.

The coalition government is reversing this shameful decline. Since the introduction of the EBacc, more young people are choosing to study the academic subjects which give them the knowledge and skills they need to progress to further study or to rewarding employment.

The EBacc is not compulsory but it is about closing the attainment gap between rich and poor and about increasing opportunity.

The provisional GCSE and A level results for 2011 also show that:

On A levels, Nick Gibb added:

A Levels are a key stepping stone towards higher education and future careers. It’s only right that we make sure our qualifications match the best in the world and keep pace with the demands of employers and universities.

It is astonishing that three times as many private school pupils are achieving three A grades or higher at A level compared to pupils from state schools. We must close this gap - which is why we are driving up teaching standards across the profession and developing a world-class curriculum for all.

Ebacc Combination

TheNatCen surveywas published in August 2011 and it showed that:

Since last year a large number of iGCSEs, many of them with significant numbers of entries, have been accredited and have therefore now been included in these statistics. These have had a significant effect on the statistics published in this SFR, most notably for those covering the independent schools. This is reflected in the overall number of pupils achieving 5 A*-C grades including English and maths.

The English Baccalaureate was introduced by the Department for Education as an additional measure in the performance tables published in January 2011.

In 2010, 22% of pupils were entered for the EBacc, with 15.6% achieving the award.

For these statistics, the date of 12 September 2010 has been used to determine the status of a school. Any schools which converted to an academy on or before this date have been published as an academy and those that have converted after this date have been treated as their predecessor school type.

The statistic for academies is based on the 166 sponsored academies that had results in both 2010 and 2011. This group of academies is used so that the year-on-year comparison is made across a consistent group of schools.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/bold-new-programme-to-get-young-people-ready-for-work,Press release,Bold new programme to get young people ready for work,Skills Minister Matthew Hancock has set out plans for a new programme to equip young people with the skills to compete for apprenticeships and other jobs.,Department for Education,10 January 2013,"The new traineeships programme, which could be in place by September 2013, would provide young people aged 16 to 24 with a tailor-made package of support that will give them the confidence, skills and experience to compete in the labour market with more experienced adults. A traineeship could be seen as a crucial stepping stone to an apprenticeship - a job with training to industry standards - or other jobs, for those young people who currently lack the necessary skills.

Employers, education and training providers, and young people have been invited to comment on the government’s proposals to help develop the new programme. The discussion paper sets out the government’s vision for traineeships, which would include:

The initiative is part of the government’s wider aim to ensure the future workforce possesses the skills that employers want in their apprentices and employees.

Skills Minister Matthew Hancock said:

We want to support everyone in our country to reach their personal best. To do that, we are introducing traineeships to help young people with the skills they need to get a job, and hold down a job.

That’s vital for our economy to compete in the global race. And it’s a question of fairness.

Traineeships will give young people the helping hand and experience they need to compete for apprenticeships and good jobs.

Professor Alison Wolf, who conducted a review of vocational education for the government, said:

Long term changes in the labour market have been very hard on young people. It is increasingly difficult for them to gain the work experience and workplace skills that help them move into permanent employment. In my review I argued that the government needed to address this issue as a matter of urgency, and I am delighted to see that they are indeed doing so.

Last year’s CBI annual education and skills survey showed that almost two thirds - 61% - of employers were unsatisfied with the self-management skills of school leavers. Employers were also not satisfied with their literacy and numeracy skills - 35% and 30% respectively.

The aim of the programme will be to help those young people who are motivated by work, but whose lack of experience often means they fall short of employer expectations.

Martin Doel, Chief Executive of the Association of Colleges, said:

We have been arguing for some time for a pre-apprenticeship ‘offer’ to young people, a mixture of training and work experience that makes them attractive to employers and competitive for apprenticeships or for other jobs with training. We therefore welcome this consultation and the thinking that underlies the questions that it poses.

Seeking the views of employers, colleges and young people themselves on what is likely to work best is essential if we are to come up with the most effective programme.

Graham Hoyle OBE, Chief Executive of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers, said:

The development of traineeships represents a hugely significant step forward in ensuring young people currently without a job or training opportunity are better equipped to find either an apprenticeship or other type of worthwhile employment.

The government is also wise to consult widely and openly with providers and others to find the design most likely to be successful.  They suggest that flexibility and personalisation are likely to be the keys to success. They are correct.

Success in this venture promises to secure real progress in ensuring that our most vulnerable young people are helped in their quest for sustainable and rewarding employment.

The government wants the programme to be open to a wide range of young people including those not in education, employment or training (NEET), those interested in a course with an education or training provider or those looking for a job.

The length of a traineeship would reflect the specific needs of participants, but they are expected to last around 6 months.

There are similar schemes in place around the country, such as the Work Ready programme by St Helens Chamber and Work Pairings by PM Training. The government wants to build on these local programmes to create a universally recognised route for work-based learning for young people who aspire to an apprenticeship or other jobs, alongside the range of support already available for this group.

Ends

Further information on traineeships is available on the Department for Educationwebsite.

The ‘Richard review of apprenticeships’ was published in November 2012. It sets out a number of recommendations to government on how to reform the apprenticeships programme. It was written by social entrepreneur and former Dragon’s Den investor Doug Richard. You can access the Richard review on theDepartment for Business, Innovation and Skill’s website.

The CBI education and skills survey 2012 is available on theCBI website

Work Ready: St Helens Chamber, an accredited training provider, spotted a gap in provision where their members were telling them that young people applying for their vacancies were not work ready. They proactively developed a programme to fill that gap. Young people spend three weeks working on employability and interview skills and preparing for job search. Some are ready to find work at that point, but others move into a 10-week programme of intensive skills training and work experience. At the end of the programme, they are certified as Work Ready: Chamber Approved, a mark which has currency with local employers. Of 50 young people who began the programme since September 2012, by November, 20 had already moved into apprenticeships, jobs or College courses.

Work Pairings: PM Training is the social enterprise training arm of the Aspire Group. They have won work through open tender as well as providing services for their sister company, Aspire Housing. This includes maintenance contracts for housing stock and providing services from gardening to painting, decorating and environmental improvements. All of this work is carried out by teams involving an experienced professional, an apprentice and one or two work pairing trainees. After an initial period of intensive work preparation, young people go out as part of these teams to gain real workplace experience and build mentoring relationships with their supervisors and apprentices. As they become work ready, participants move into an apprenticeship with PM or are supported into an apprenticeship or job with an external employer, often from PM’s own supply chain.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-sets-out-strategy-to-be-positive-for-youth,Press release,Government sets out strategy to be Positive for Youth,Children’s Minister Tim Loughton publishes the government's new vision for youth services.,Department for Education and Tim Loughton,19 December 2011,"Young people across the country should be able to inspect their local youth services and advise on how to improve them, Children’s Minister Tim Loughton said today.

Publishing the government’s new vision for young people and youth services, Positive for Youth, the Minister called on every local authority to get young people involved in local decision-making.

The Government also wants local authorities to build stronger partnerships with voluntary organisations and local businesses to develop opportunities for young people in their local communities. Many businesses, such as Starbucks, 02 and the Co-operative are leading the way with innovative projects that are inspiring young people.

Positive for Youth brings together everything the Government is doing to support young people. It has been produced with youth professionals and young people themselves.

To build a society that is more Positive for Youth, the Government is:

Tim Loughton said:

For too long young people in this country have had a raw deal. The vast majority are law-abiding, want to do well at school and are making a positive contribution to their communities. More youngsters volunteer than any other group in society. We must recognise their achievements.

I want Positive for Youth to be a turning point in how we view and treat young people, and in how we think about youth services. In a tough economic climate, bringing in charities and businesses to help develop and provide youth services is the way forward. There are some superb projects run by organisations like British Youth Council, O2, Starbucks and the Co-operative, building links between young people and their local communities.

Councils should also think about how to get young people involved in decisions that affect them. I want them to open their doors to young people and get them involved - auditing and inspecting local services and listening to their ideas on how to improve things.

Raising young people’s aspirations and educational attainment is crucial to their success in life. The Government has already announced in the Schools White Paper: The Importance of Teaching, significant reforms and investment to radically improve educational standards. The Government also set out last week a new strategy to increase young people’s participation in learning and work, Building Engagement, Building Futures.

The Government will be measuring progress by local authorities, and central government, in delivering better, more targeted opportunities for young people.

Without creating new burdens on local authorities, the Government will publish annual data on positive and aspirational measures for young people.

The Government will also publish at the end of 2012 a ‘one year on’ progress update towards creating a society which is more positive for youth.

Kris Engskov, managing director of Starbucks UK & Ireland, said:

There are growing pressures facing youth today, but there are still many reasons to be optimistic about the large number of incredible young people with the ambition and enthusiasm to make a difference in their communities.  They deserve our support and they deserve to be heard.  That’s why we’re backing today’s ‘Positive for Youth’ initiative and why we are giving funding and training to young people across the country through our Starbucks Youth Action Programme.

Ronan Dunne, Chief Executive Officer, Telefonica UK Ltd said:

We believe in young people.  That is why we run O2 Think Big - a social action programme that provides funding, training and support for young people who are running projects across the UK to improve their local communities.

I am constantly struck by the desire of young people to contribute to society, to make a positive difference to the world around them. Thousands of our staff gets involved in their local Think Big projects and many of the young people we support spend time inside the company to learn more about our business and the world of work.  Giving young people the support and opportunities they need to fulfil their potential is one of the biggest challenges facing the country.  We welcome the Government’s Positive for Youth initiative.

Peter Marks, Group Chief Executive of The Co-operative Group, said:

‘Positive for Youth’ represents an ambitious challenge for everyone - Government, business and society alike - to do what they can to motivate, support and inspire young people. It’s a really tough time to be a young person in Britain and at The Co-operative we believe businesses have a real responsibility to help motivate and inspire young people by giving them new opportunities to gain the skills, knowledge and experiences to be pioneers for their generation.

A quarter of our employees at The Co-operative are under 25 and it is our vision to bring about a cultural shift in the way that young people are viewed and treated in this country. Over the last two years, our Truth about Youth programme has brought over 36,000 adults and young people together from seven UK cities to tackle the widespread negative perceptions of youth. In addition, through our Apprenticeship Academy and our Inspiring Young People campaign, we are offering young people new opportunities to change their world for the better. As a society, we must start talking up the young and see them as the solution rather than the problem. We are delighted to welcome the Minister to our Truth about Youth project at Oval House in South London today and we are committed to working in partnership with the Government to support young people and hope others will join us in being ‘Positive for Youth’.

Liam Preston - Chair,British Youth Council, said:

To be ‘positive for youth’ is a great attitude and starting point for a journey of real improvement for young people through tough times. The policy ‘Positive for Youth’ is also a starting point and marks a commitment to make things better and I particularly like its promises to involve more young people along the way and to get them greater recognition for the positive part they play through the media.

The British Youth Council and UK Youth Parliament stand ready and willing to play their part but this will not only include championing greater recognition for success, but also holding decision makers to account if they let us down or if the promises don’t deliver.

Anne Longfield OBE, Chief Executive of 4Children said:

This document is a clarion call to all of us to make young people a priority. The challenge now is for councils, teachers, youth workers, health professionals and the police to combine their expertise and resources to truly help young people flourish. We must invest in our young people’s future.

Martina Milburn, chief executive of The Prince’s Trust and co-chair of the Youth Action Group, said:

The Youth Action Group was established to focus and advise government on helping the most disadvantaged young people.  We very much welcome the Positive for Youth statement by the government, which takes up many of our ideas and urges a change of mindset in attitudes to young people across government and broader society.  We know that young people have huge potential and enthusiasm to contribute to society and it is great to see that government shares this perspective.  The monitoring and outcome indicators will be a vital tool in ensuring this statement really makes an impact, particularly for the young people who are currently most marginalised.  The Youth Action Group will play a key role in holding the government to account on this.

Positive for Youth has been developed in partnership with young people, the voluntary and community sector and businesses. It is available on theDepartment’s website.

The Department is providing £850,000 for 2011-2013 to theBritish Youth Council, who will work in partnership with National Children’s Bureau and UK Youth, to promote youth voice in local communities.

The Department has announced today that is providing £320,000 to Business in the Community until March 2013 to broker business engagement with young people.

The new measures of to be published annually on outcomes for young people are:
* % of 16 to 18s reporting that they are satisfied with their lives;
* % of 16 to 19s volunteering;
* % of 16 and 17 year olds in education and work-based learning;
* % of 18 year olds in education, employment or training;
* % of young people aged 19 who have claimed free school meals achieving level 3 (to focus on improving their outcomes relative to others)
* % of 19 year olds achieving Level 2;
* % of 10 to 17 year olds who have not had any contact with the criminal justice system (as measured by a reprimand, warning or conviction);
* % of 11 to 15 year olds misusing drugs and alcohol; and

Parents will, for the first time today, have more information about how schools are performing in providing a rounded academic education for children, along with how they spend their money. In addition, for the first time ever, parents will be able to use the Department for Education website to create their own performance tables that rank local schools or to compare them with others.

Nick Gibb discusses the school performance tables

The figures published show:

Education Secretary Michael Gove said:

This is the most detail parents and the public have ever had about how children are performing in England’s secondary schools.

Children, parents and schools should be proud of their results, which have been achieved through all the hard work they have put in. But as the international evidence from PISA shows us, England still lags behind other nations. We have not succeeded in closing the gap and in raising attainment for all students.

That’s why we are reforming our school system by learning from the best-performing countries. In nearly every other developed country in the world children are assessed in a range of core academic subjects at 15 or 16. That is why the Coalition introduced the English Baccalaureate as a measure of performance.

The key performance measure remains the number of children who get 5 A* to C passes at GCSE including English and maths.

I am open to arguments about how we can further improve every measure in the performance tables - including the English Baccalaureate. But I am determined to ensure that our exam standards match the highest standards around the world.

The spending data published today will also allow parents, researchers and the general public for the first time to look at how much individual schools spent per pupil last year on areas such as teaching staff, energy and catering, to judge if a school is making the best use of the funding allocated to them. Schools can compare how they are spending their money compared to other schools.

businesses struggling will have now until the end of March to access government generous loan schemes

Chancellor also confirmed that the Budget will be on the 3 March and set out the next phase of the plan to tackle the virus and protect jobs

In a move to ensure firms can access the support they need through continuing economic disruption, Rishi Sunak also confirmed he would be extending the government-guaranteed Covid-19 business loan schemes until the end of March.

These changes come ahead of the Budget, which the Chancellor has confirmed will take place on 3 March 2021. This will deliver the next phase of the plan to tackle the virus and protect jobs, so the extensions to the business loan and furlough schemes enable businesses to plan with certainty and access support in the first few months of the New Year ahead of the further update on wider Covid-19 economic support.

So far, the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) scheme has protected 9.6 million jobs across the UK with more than one million businesses accessing loans to help them through the crisis.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said:

“Our package of support for businesses and workers continues to be one of the most generous and effective in the world – helping our economy to recover and protecting livelihoods across the country.

“We know the premium businesses place on certainty, so it is right that we enable businesses to plan ahead regardless of the path the virus takes, which is why we’re providing certainty and clarity by extending this support, as well as implementing our Plan for Jobs.”

Business Secretary, Alok Sharma, said:

“While our loan schemes have provided a vital lifeline to millions of firms across the country, we know that business owners need additional certainty as we head into the New Year.

“Extending government-backed loan schemes will give companies right across the UK the finance they need to support, protect and create jobs as we build back better from the pandemic.”

The Chancellor said he would review the employer contribution element of the CJRS in January, but decided to bring this forward to allow businesses to plan ahead for the remainder of the winter and the New Year.

The government will continue to pay 80% of the salary of employees for hours not worked until the end of April. Employers will only be required to pay wages, National Insurance Contributions (NICS) and pensions for hours worked; and NICS and pensions for hours not worked.

The eligibility criteria for the UK-wide scheme will remain unchanged and these changes will continue to apply to all Devolved Administrations.

Extending the scheme until the end of April means businesses across the country will have certainty about what support will be available to them.

Businesses will also be given until the end of March to access the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, and the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme. These had been due to close at the end of January.

The schemes have already provided over £68 billion in guaranteed loans, and helped to keep afloat business in all sectors of the UK economy who have been impacted by coronavirus.

We are extending the schemes now, ahead of Christmas and further into the new year, to ensure that businesses can continue to access the support they need to grow and recover.

The government has already announced that more support will be available beyond March, through a successor loan scheme. More details of the scheme will be announced in due course, with the government providing a further update on wider Covid-19 economic support at the Budget on 3 March.

The furlough and loan schemes are part of the government’s wider plan to support, create and protect jobs through its Plan for Jobs. This includes the Kickstart Scheme, more investment in training and skills as well as the Self Employment Income Support Scheme grant, with a fourth grant being made available from February to April 2021.

Thestatisticspublished by the Department for Education show that median earnings in 2016/17 for graduates one and three years after completing a degree have increased from the previous year to £19,900 one year after graduating, and £23,300 three years after graduating. These earnings at one and three years also increased after being adjusted for inflation.

The figures are one part of the Government’s drive to make data more available than ever before to help inform students’ choices, and these statistics play a vital role in helping students and parents to understand the likely earnings and outcomes for different subjects.

However financial outcomes are just one of the considerations for students when choosing a degree subject, as students will make career choices not solely based on a likely graduate salary but also social value and job satisfaction.

Universities Minister Chris Skidmore said:

We now have record rates of English 18-year-olds going into higher education, so I am delighted to see that graduate earnings have continued to increase for recent graduates, showing that it pays to study in our world-class higher education system.

We want students and their parents to have the best possible information about higher education. This data is an invaluable tool to help prospective students make the right choice and know what to expect from the course they choose.

It is vital that we ensure that higher education carries on delivering for students, the taxpayer and the economy, and it will continue to do so as long as we focus relentlessly on quality in our system.

The data out today shows how earnings varied for different subjects in 2016/17 from one to ten years after graduating, from disciplines like creative arts and design through to medicine and dentistry.

The figures also show that the gap between median earnings for male and female graduates has widened in 2016/17, with a 15% difference between what male and female graduates earned five years after completing their degree, compared to 12% in 2014/15.

This latest data on graduate earnings follows research published in November which, for the first time, used the LEO dataset to compare the earnings by subject, institution and course for people who went to higher education to those with similar background characteristics who did not.

The research by the IFS showed that the vast majority of graduates with a degree earn more at the age of 29 than those who did not go to university – particularly female graduates who saw a greater difference in what they earned compared to women who didn’t complete a degree than male graduates to their counterparts."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/scholarships-continue-as-physics-teacher-recruitment-rises,Press release,Scholarships continue as physics teacher recruitment rises,Details of continued investment in physics teaching.,Department for Education and The Rt Hon Michael Gove,6 September 2012,"Education Secretary Michael Gove has today (Thursday) announced the continuation of a £2m-a-year partnership between the Department for Education (DfE) and the Institute of Physics (IOP).

In a sustained effort to overcome the chronic shortage of specialist physics teachers, Michael Gove has announced that IOP’s teacher training scholarships will continue.

Education Secretary Michael Gove said:

Following the successful recruitment of 115 excellent trainee teachers this year, I’m delighted to announce another recruitment round over this academic year.

We are starting to see the root causes of our physics teacher shortage being addressed. By raising the status of the profession, we’re bringing highly sought-after physics graduates and career-changers, all with incredible aptitude to teach, into the classroom.

The £20,000 scholarships - available to graduates with a 2:1 or first class degree intending to do a mainstream physics, or physics with maths, initial teacher training course - have contributed to another year of record high physics teacher recruitment.

IOP has also today published a summary of trends in physics education and, as the note reports, “While there is no magic bullet to remedy the chronic shortage of physics teachers, the situation is starting to improve as steps have been taken by both the IOP and the Department for Education”.

With a need to recruit 1,000 new specialist physics teachers every year for more than a decade to address the imbalance between the number of specialist biology, chemistry and physic teachers in science departments across England, there is still a long way to go.

Professor Peter Main, director of education and science at IOP, said:

For the second year running, we are seeing record numbers of would-be teachers starting teacher training courses in either physics or physics with maths.

Last year, we saw 889 new trainees start their initial teacher training and this year all evidence suggests that we’ll see more than 900 entering teacher training. This is up from below 600 just two years ago.

IOP credits a range of developments with the strides being made to address the teacher shortage; from the government’s introduction of ambitious teacher recruitment targets for physics through to the teacher training scholarships and efforts being made to retain greater numbers of physics teachers in the profession once qualified.

With the shortage due to persist for at least a decade another government-funded programme called the Stimulating Physics Network continues to work with non-specialist physics teachers to ensure non-specialists (often biologists) have the knowledge, enthusiasm and confidence to successfully teach physics.

The IOP’s note on the summary of trends in physics education can be found on theInstitute of Physicswebsite.

The Institute of Physics is a leading scientific society promoting physics and bringing physicists together for the benefit of all. It has a worldwide membership of around 45,000 comprising physicists from all sectors, as well as those with an interest in physics. It works to advance physics research, application and education; and engages with policymakers and the public to develop awareness and understanding of physics. Its publishing company, IOP Publishing, is a world leader in professional scientific publishing and the electronic dissemination of physics. Go to theIOP website.

The Teaching Agency is responsible for initial teacher training (ITT) in England. It provides a comprehensive programme of support to help graduates become a teacher, providing guidance all the way through the application process.

Children’s centres play a crucial role in early intervention, ensuring families can get help when they need it, tackling issues early and helping to prevent costly problems from emerging later on. The Government wants the network of children’s centres to be retained but focused much more effectively on those families who need them the most. We have ensured there is enough money in the system through the new Early Intervention Grant (EIG) to keep the network of children’s centres.

Local authorities continue to have duties under the Childcare Act 2006 to consult before opening, closing or significantly changing children’s centres, and to secure sufficient provision to meet local need so far as is reasonably practicable. Statutory guidance (published in March 2010) accompanies these duties, which outlines how the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 provisions relate to children’s centres.

The statutory guidance advises local authorities, primary care trusts and Jobcentre Plus on the action they should take to comply with their duties. Although the delivery context has changed, these duties remain current. The guidance will be particularly useful to local authorities, as they work with their local communities to plan future children’s centre provision.

The following sections of the guidance are particularly relevant:

Section 5A of the Act: The duty to make sufficient provision of children’s centres to meet local need, so far as is reasonably practicable - pages 7-8 of the guidance, which emphasises that local authorities should ensure universal access to children’s centres is achieved and all children and families can be reached effectively, especially the most deprived.

Section 5D: The duty to consult before establishing, significantly changing or closing a children’s centre - pages 15-18 of the guidance, which emphasises that local authorities should allow adequate time for responses, actively encourage parents from disadvantaged groups to participate, and demonstrate in their decision how they have taken consultation responses into account.

We are now working with a range of partners to develop a new shared vision for early years, which is to be published as a policy statement later in the year. In the meantime, please note that some parts of the statutory guidance do not reflect recent policy developments.

Claw-back of funding is triggered where an asset funded wholly or partly by DfE is disposed of, or the asset is no longer used to meet the aims and objectives consistent with the Sure Start Early Years and Childcare Grant (SSEYCG) or Aiming High for Disabled Children Grant (AHDC).

Local authorities must notify the Department for Education of any plans to dispose of grant funded assets. Local authorities should operate on the presumption that claw-back will be enforced. However, subject to prior approval from the DfE, claw-back may be waived or deferred where an asset is sold and the proceeds are reinvested in another asset for a similar purpose consistent with the aims of the grant.

Disposal means a sale, transfer, or change of use of a capital asset. It includes the transfer of ownership of a lease, or freehold assets.

Further information on the disposal of assets and invocation of claw-back can be found in paragraphs 33 to 45 of theCapital Guidance.

Almost 600 schools are now sponsored academies and getting the support they need to improve.

Figures out today (Friday 11 January 2013) reveal that there are now 3,167 schools in England either open as academies or in the pipeline to become academies.

This includes more than 2,000 converter academies - schools which have decided to take advantage of the benefits and freedoms that come with academy status.

Today’s total also includes 200 of the weakest primary schools which are now sponsored academies and getting the great leadership, support and external challenge they need to improve. The government said last year that it would find outstanding sponsors, with a track record of tackling under-performance, for these schools - and today can announce that it has achieved that aim.

This year the Department for Education will go further and faster, and find sponsors for 400 more of the weakest primary schools so that they too can start providing a first-class education for their pupils.

Failing schools have been specifically targeted by the government for radical improvement. The total number of sponsored academies is now 599 compared to just 203 in May 2010. In 2011, the GCSE results of sponsored academies open for at least two years improved almost twice as fast as those for all state-funded schools.

Academies put power back into the hands of headteachers. Free from local authority control, they can make the changes to their school they know they need to make. That can mean lengthening the school day, benefiting parents and pupils, recruiting new teachers in subjects in which pupils struggle, or introducing new contracts to reward high-achieving staff.

There are:

Education Secretary Michael Gove said:

We believe in trusting the professionals. That’s why we gave teachers the opportunity to take on more freedom and responsibility and they have grabbed it with both hands. Many are now going even further and taking on responsibility for turning around less successful schools. These outstanding converters are becoming the new academy sponsors of the future raising standards across the state sector.

Regional and local authority breakdowns show the areas which have the highest and lowest proportions of academies.

There are 28 local authorities where at least 1 in 5 schools is now an open academy. In almost all local authorities, 129, at least 1 in 5 secondary schools is an open academy. And there are 10 local authorities where at least 1 in 5 primary schools is now an open primary academy.

The local authorities with the highest proportion of open academies are Darlington (66%), North East Lincolnshire (50%), (Swindon 37%), and Thurrock and Torbay (both 36%). In Darlington, Rutland and Bexley, every secondary school is an academy.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pioneering-national-poetry-competition-to-inspire-teens,Press release,Pioneering national poetry competition to inspire teens,Pupils will be encouraged to learn poems by heart by taking part in a new national competition.,Department for Education and The Rt Hon Michael Gove,6 December 2012,"A new national poetry recitation competition will be launched in schools and colleges next year, Education Secretary Michael Gove and former Poet Laureate Sir Andrew Motion announced today.

The Poetry Archive’s competition, ‘Poetry by Heart’, will see thousands of students aged 14 to 18 competing to become national champion for their skill in memorising and performing poems.

Students will choose poems from an anthology of classic and contemporary poetry specially selected for the competition. These will include ‘Dover Beach’ by Matthew Arnold, ‘Ozymandias’ by Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Shakespeare’s clown song from Twelfth Night - ‘When that I was and a little tiny boy’.

The Department for Education is providing £500,000 of funding to The Poetry Archive to develop and run the National Poetry Competition as part of its commitment to help bring poetry to life in schools. The competition aims to develop and support inspiring poetry teaching in schools and to motivate pupils and teachers to explore England’s rich literary heritage.

Education Secretary Michael Gove said:

To know a poem by heart is to own a great work of art forever. Andrew Motion is a hero for ensuring more children than ever will carry poetry with them all their lives.

Sir Andrew Motion, former Poet Laureate, said:

Poetry by Heart is the best thing that’s happened for poetry in schools for a long time: a way for pupils to have serious fun while they extend their reading, deepen their powers of appreciation, and memorise beautiful and intriguing poems which will enrich their lives for ever.

James Ashmore, Director of Learning in English at Moor End Academy in Huddersfield, said:

Poetry by Heart is an excellent idea. Schools across England buzz every day with opportunities and activities they provide for students above and beyond the curriculum, but a national competition, backed by some of the country’s great poets, would be an excellent, unifying initiative.

Launching in schools and colleges in January 2013, the aims of the competition are to:

The final stage of the competition will be a ‘finals weekend’ based on regional heats, which will lead to a grand final held at the National Portrait Gallery in April 2013.

Prizes will be awarded to winners, runners-up and their schools. There will also be a national winner’s trophy for the most outstanding young competitor.

Poetry By Heart is an educational initiative of The Poetry Archive. The Poetry Archive is the world’s premier online collection of recordings of poets reading their own work.

Sir Andrew Motion is UK poet laureate between 1999 to 2009, and co-founder and Director of thePoetry Archive.

The full anthology of poems will be announced next month when schools launch their individual competitions.

Announced on 6 July 2010, the EYFS review is looking at how best to protect young children’s safety and welfare and support their development and learning.

Speaking about the call for evidence Dame Clare said:

I hope those with a passion for Early Years education take the opportunity to respond to this call for evidence. I want to hear from parents, professionals, carers and other Early Years experts about their experiences and views on the EYFS. I particularly want to hear from those who are delivering the EYFS on a regular basis and can advise on where we could make improvements. These views will help shape the future of the EYFS and will be invaluable in helping me to identify the best parts of the EYFS, as well as the parts that may have to change. I look forward to hearing from you.

The review will cover four main areas:

The call for evidence runs from 2 August to 30 September 2010 and can be accessed on the Department’s consultations website.

Dame Clare will provide a final report on the EYFS review in spring 2011. The Government will then consult on any proposed changes before they take effect from September 2012.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/a-third-of-children-reach-expected-level-in-pilot-of-phonics-check,News story,A third of children reach expected level in pilot of phonics check,Gibb: “Phonics is the proven method that will drive up reading standards.”,Department for Education and The Rt Hon Nick Gibb,9 December 2011,"Schools Minister Nick Gibb today said that the Government was “unashamedly ambitious” in its bid to drive up the standard of children’s reading.

Mr Gibb said that although it was good that more than 80 per cent of children routinely met expected reading levels at age seven and age 11, it was time to focus on driving up the performances of the one in five children who fail to reach the expected level and on getting more children to exceed expectations.

He said synthetic phonics, taught systematically, was the method proven to improve reading standards for all children, including the weakest readers, and ensure they reached their potential.

Mr Gibb acknowledged classroom teachers’ efforts to improve children’s reading skills but pointed to figures showing that:

Internationally, he said that:

Nick Gibb was speaking as figures were released showing that 32 per cent of six-year-olds who took the screening check reached what he called the “appropriately challenging” expected level, which was set by about 50 teachers whose schools were involved in the pilot.

He said the figures suggested many more pupils could benefit from phonics, giving them a solid grounding in the basics at an early stage. Teachers can then build on these skills so that more children develop into flourishing, confident readers by the end of Key Stage 1.

The pilot check was taken this summer by Year 1 pupils in about 300 schools, 27 per cent of whom said they teach phonics systematically, as opposed to teaching children mixed methods such as picture clues and sight memory to read words. This ratio is believed to be broadly in line with the picture across England’s primary schools.

The short check involves pupils reading 40 words to their teacher. The type of words in the check are covered by all good quality phonics schemes by the end of Year 1. Mr Gibb said it was vital that pupils are able to read these words by the end of Year 1 to give them the best chance of future success. The most common score achieved by pupils in the pilot was 40 out of 40.

Following a positive independent evaluation in September, the phonics check will be rolled out nationally next summer. The check will help provide teachers with vital information to identify pupils needing extra help with reading. Schools’ individual results will not be published.

Nick Gibb said:

We need to face up to the uncomfortable truth that, despite the hard work of teachers, not enough of our children are able to read to a high enough standard. We have to take account of our place internationally and listen to business leaders concerned about many school leavers’ literacy.

The Government can no longer simply congratulate itself on the proportion of pupils reaching the expected level.

The phonics check’s expected level, set by teachers, is appropriately challenging. We must adjust our sights if we are to tackle the country’s reading problem. The levels we expect children to reach at Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 must not be the limits of our ambition - they should be considered the minimum we expect. And we must get those below the level up to a standard that will help them progress further.

A solid grounding in phonics will help many children who are weak readers to improve. It will also see more pupils achieve a high Level 2 or a Level 3 score at the end of Key Stage1. It is this level of achievement which puts children on the path to success.

I am unashamedly ambitious in wanting to see all children reading to the very highest standard.

Evidence from around the world points to synthetic phonics, taught systematically, as the method that will bring all children up to the high level we want. Teachers in the pilot say the new check will allow them to identify children’s reading problems they hadn’t previously been aware of. Those pupils will then be given the extra help they need to become confident, fluent readers.

Many teachers have started to embrace phonics and some schools performed very strongly in the pilot.

But the results also show that some other schools could be more systematic in their teaching of phonics and we are supporting them to do this. The teaching of phonics is being prioritised in primary teacher training. We are giving schools up to £3,000 in match funding so they can buy training products and books. And we are making phonics and reading a key part of the new Ofsted inspection process.

Statistics show that pupils who achieve a good start in the first few years of reading are very likely to progress quickly throughout school.

2010 data showed that of those children who had previously achieved a strong Level 2 (2a) in Key Stage 1 reading:

2010 data showed that: of the children who only just achieved Level 2 (2c) in reading at Key Stage 1 reading

Pupils who reach Level 2 in reading are expected to be able to read simple texts with some understanding, give an opinion about characters, events or ideas, and put sounds together to understand new words.

The Government believes all children should at least be secure in these skills by age seven, and that many should achieve a Level 2a. In Year 2, many pupils should also be covering some of the Level 3 reading skills. This means they should be reading books over and above their phonics scheme. They will be able to show an understanding of the writer’s purpose, and will be starting to discuss their ideas about the book.

The current expected standards of attainment have been in place as part of the National Curriculum since 1999.  The National Curriculum Review will ensure that the content, breadth and level of challenge of England’s new National Curriculum is comparable with the curricula of the world’s highest performing education systems.  This will undoubtedly mean raised expectations. This will help England to move back up the international league tables, and ensure children leave school with the knowledge which will stand them in good stead throughout their career and adult life.

The Year 1 phonics screening check was piloted in about 300 schools in June 2011 -  229 of these came from a nationally representative sample. In total, 8,963 children participated in the pilot from schools in the representative sample.

Pilot schools were recruited in February/March 2011. They were given details of the content and structure of the screening check at the training meetings in late May/early June, just ahead of their pupils taking the check.

The overall structure of the check was designed at a series of meetings in September and October 2010, with a group of phonics experts (academics and product developers) and teachers. Ofqual was also represented at these meetings.

In 2012, the check will take place in all primary schools with six-year-old children during the week commencing Monday 18 June.

How does the check work?

Non-words are important to include because words such as “vap” or “jound” are new to all children. They cannot be read by memory or vocabulary - children have to use their decoding skills so it is a fair and accurate way to assess ability to decode.

An example of a check, including words used, can be foundon our website.

Phonics teaches children how to:

Children can then use this knowledge to “de-code” new words that they see. This is the first important step in learning to read.

Research shows that when phonics is taught in a structured way - starting with the easiest sounds, progressing through to the most complex - that it is the most effective way of teaching young children to read. It is particularly helpful for children aged five to seven.

Almost all children who have good teaching of phonics will learn the skills they need to tackle new words. They go on to read any kind of text. Most importantly, they will read for enjoyment.

They also tend to read more accurately than those taught using other methods, such as “look and say”. This includes children who find learning to read difficult, for example those who have dyslexia.

The Department for Education today published anevidence notedetailing some of the research supporting the use of phonics as the most effective method to teach children how to read.

It includes the findings of a number of studies, including:

A seven-year study in Clackmannanshire, Scotland, of the teaching of synthetic phonics to 300 children found they made more progress in reading and spelling than other children their age.

A 2005 Australian report, Teaching Reading, which said:

The incontrovertible finding from the extensive body of local and international evidence-based literacy research is that for children during the early years of schooling (and subsequently if needed) to be able to link their knowledge of spoken language to their knowledge of written language, they must first master the alphabetic code - the system of grapheme-phoneme correspondences that link written words to their pronunciations. Because these are both foundational and essential skills for the development of competence in reading, writing and spelling, they must be taught explicitly, systematically, early and well.

The US National Reading Panel report of 2006, which said:

Systematic synthetic phonics instruction had a positive and significant effect on disabled readers’ reading skills. These children improved substantially in their ability to read words and showed significant, albeit small, gains in their ability to process text as a result of systematic synthetic phonics instruction. This type of phonics instruction benefits both students with learning disabilities and low-achieving students who are not disabled. Moreover, systematic synthetic phonics instruction was significantly more effective in improving low socio-economic status (SES) children’s alphabetic knowledge and word reading skills than instructional approaches that were less focused on these initial reading skills… Across all grade levels, systematic phonics instruction improved the ability of good readers to spell.

The final report of the Independent Review of the Teaching of Early Reading, by Jim Rose in 2006, emphasised that beginner readers should be taught using a systematic approach to phonics. He cautioned that evidence submitted to the review which suggested using a mix of approaches could hinder children’s progress: “A model of reading which encourages switching between various strategies, particularly when phonic work is regarded as only one such strategy, all of equal worth, risks paying insufficient attention to the critical skills of word recognition which must first be secured by beginner readers, [for example] if beginner readers are encouraged to infer from pictures the word they have to decode …It may also lead to diluting the focused phonics teaching that is necessary for securing accurate word reading.”

Ofsted’s 2010 report, Reading by Six: How the Best Schools Do It, looked at inspection evidence from a sample of 12 primary schools. It explains that “concentrated and systematic use of phonics is key to their success; this is based on high-quality and expert teaching that gives pupils the opportunity to apply what they have learnt through reading, writing and comprehension of what they are reading”.

An independent evaluation of the pilot check was conducted by the Centre for Education and Inclusion Research (CEIR) at Sheffield Hallam University for the Department for Education.

It found that:

These schools have made a commitment to work with other schools and share their expertise. This is the first wave of converters in a rolling process that allows schools to convert at any stage.

The running total of schools that will become academies this academic year is 216 so far. The current breakdown is as follows:

This is record progress; it took five years for 15 city technology colleges to open, and four years for the first 27 academies to open.

Michael Gove said:

This Government believes that teachers and headteachers, not politicians and bureaucrats, should control schools and have more power over how they are run. That’s why we are spreading academy freedoms. This will give heads more power to tackle disruptive children, to protect and reward teachers better, and to give children the specialist teaching they need.

This year’s GCSE results saw academy pupils improving at nearly three times the historic rate of state school improvement.

Heads of new academies today welcomed their new freedoms:

Patricia Sowter, Head of Cuckoo Hall Primary School, Edmonton, said:

With the new academy freedoms we will continue to develop our autonomy and take the school forward in what is an area of London that faces significant challenges and disadvantage. We will now have the flexibility to adapt and extend the curriculum, target resources more effectively, deploy specialist staff and above all build sustainable capacity to ensure continued and long term outstanding educational provision, to best meet the needs of our children and wider school community.

Cuckoo Hall remains committed to supporting and working with other schools to improve children’s achievement. As an academy, Cuckoo Hall aims to build long term sustainable capacity to continue its effective work with other schools, and will seek to widen its impact on overall school improvement.

Greg Martin, Executive Head of Durand Academy, Lambeth, said:

Becoming an academy is so important for us at Durand. We are proud to deliver an outstanding education for our pupils, in an area with one of the highest levels of social deprivation in the UK. The freedom that academy status brings will allow us to deliver and develop a flexible curriculum to ensure that these children reach their full potential and achieve the very best. We look forward to using our academy freedoms to work with other schools to raise levels of attainment across the board.

David Hampson, Principal of Tollbar Business and Enterprise College, Grimbsy, said:

The benefits of becoming an academy will be enormous - less bureaucracy certainly but also more resources which we ourselves will be able to manage. We are very happy to embrace the requirement to associate ourselves with less successful schools and indeed we already have been working with a number of other schools locally and nationally, sharing our winning ways. In fact, Tollbar, as Tollbar Edge, are the sponsors of another academy which replaces a local school in special measures. We believe that we have already demonstrated our ability to run a highly successful establishment and this fantastic initiative will certainly help us to offer even more to the young people in our care.

Dr John Marincowitz Head of the Queen Elizabeth’s School, Barnet, said:

We are delighted with our new status as an academy. Greater autonomy brings significant beneficial opportunities. For example, greater freedom to decide the curriculum will enable Queen Elizabeth’s to secure a suitably academic curriculum that is geared more accurately to the needs of our pupils. Similarly, greater autonomy means we can now ensure that the resources and services we purchase are appropriate for the school and more closely aligned to the specific requirements of our pupils. We also look forward to bolstering the support we already provide to local schools as a specialist Training School and especially Northgate Hospital School with whom we have an established relationship.

Helen Hyde, Head of Watford Grammar School for Girls, Hertfordshire, and President of Foundation, Aided Schools and Academies National Association (FASNA), said:

I am very excited by the new challenges and opportunities that are created by becoming an academy. We will use the freedoms and autonomy to improve the educational provision for our students as well as form new partnerships with schools who would like to work with us both in the UK and abroad.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/great-teachers-could-become-master-teachers,Press release,Great teachers could become ‘Master Teachers’,"A new ‘Master Teacher Standard’ to recognise outstanding teachers should be introduced, according to an independent review commissioned by the Government.",Department for Education and The Rt Hon Nick Gibb,12 December 2011,"Master Teacher Standards

The review team, led by Sally Coates, Principal of Burlington Danes Academy in London, were asked to simplify the current teachers’ standards, which define the qualities and skills expected of teachers at various career stages. Their first report, published in July, raised the bar in terms of defining the minimum requirements for all teachers.

The review team has now considered the standards expected for more experienced and higher performing teachers. They are recommending scrapping the existing system, which has three separate categories, and introducing a single ‘Master Teacher Standard.’ This will recognise truly excellent teachers and provide a focal point for all good teachers to plan their professional and career development.

The Government has welcomed the review team’s recommendations and is now considering how they might be implemented.

The ‘Master Teacher Standard’ describes a clear set of characteristics for high-performing teachers. They include:

Schools Minister Nick Gibb said:

The proposal to establish a new ‘Master Teacher Standard’, that identifies and recognises our many outstanding teachers, will send a powerful message about what constitutes the very best in teaching.

The proposal has the potential to bring much greater simplicity and clarity to what is at present a complex and highly bureaucratic system of standards. It is a further step towards our ambition to elevate the status of the teaching profession and ensure the very best are recognised as key figures in the intellectual life of the country.

Sally Coates, Chair of the review group said:

The ‘Master Teacher Standard’ we are proposing takes the standards to a very high level for the most able teachers. It is designed to set out a powerful statement of what it means to be a really excellent teacher, and
I am confident that those who can meet the standard will be proud to be known as ‘Master Teachers.’

These are teachers who will have the deepest impact on improving the lives of their pupils. It is absolutely right that such an achievement should be properly recognised by the new Standard, and I hope that we have out set a vision to which all teachers can aspire. I very much look forward to seeing our proposals being taken forward and put into practice.

Joan Deslandes, Headteacher of Kingsford Community School, Newham, said today:

For hundreds of years, Britain has led the way in education. The ‘Master Teacher Standard’ represents a clear and effective model which will ensure that our country continues its great tradition of pioneering, inspirational teaching.

A benchmark for educational excellence, the ‘Master Teacher Standard’ will motivate a new generation of teachers to develop innovative strategies which improve learning, so that every young person, from every walk of life, realises their full potential.

Diane Rochford, Headteacher of John F Kennedy Special School, Newham, said.

It will encourage and strengthen performance in the classroom, in all educational settings, whilst recognising those teachers who continually seek to find ways to inspire and engage learners - regardless of their starting point in life.

Greg Wallace, Executive Principal, Best Start Federation (which runs primary schools in London Fields, Mandeville, Whitmore, and Woodberry Down), said:

I think the new ‘Master Teacher Standard’ is a major step forward in defining the characteristics of expert teachers. The standard is something all good teachers will aspire to meet. The very good use of language within the standard gives us a strong sense of what the classrooms of ‘Master Teachers’ will be like. Words like ‘command’ and ‘inspire’ help create a concrete image of what we need from teachers at the top of the profession.

The Secretary of State has today written to Sally Coates welcoming her report and the principle and wording of the ‘Master Teacher Standard.’

His letter explains that he needs to consider carefully how the ‘Master Teacher Standard’ might be introduced before any arrangements can be made for its implementation. This will include asking the School Teachers Review Body to consider the implications for teachers’ pay of the report’s recommendation to discontinue the Post-Threshold, Excellent Teacher and Advanced Skills Teacher standards.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/bailey-review-of-the-commercialisation-and-sexualisation-of-childhood-final-report-published,Press release,Bailey Review of the Commercialisation and Sexualisation of Childhood: final report published,Report recommends clampdown on sexualised ‘wallpaper’ surrounding children.,"Department for Education, Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (2018 to 2021), Sarah Teather and Ed Vaizey",6 June 2011,"A six-month independent review into the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood, which reports today, calls on businesses and media to play their part in ending the drift towards an increasingly sexualised ‘wallpaper’ that surrounds children.

Reg Bailey, Chief Executive of Mothers’ Union, who led the independent review, has listened to parents’ concerns about the barriers they face in bringing up their children. They are particularly unhappy with the increasingly sexualised culture surrounding their children, which they feel they have no control over. They singled out sexually explicit music videos, outdoor adverts that contain sexualised images, and the amount of sexual content in family programmes on TV.

Reg Bailey’s recommendations are based on parents’ concerns and are intended to support them, make sure their views are taken more seriously by businesses and broadcasters, and help children understand the potential dangers they face. They will put control back in the hands of families.

The recommendations include:

Reg Bailey said:

Society has become increasingly full of sexualised imagery. This has created a wallpaper to children’s lives. Parents feel there is no escape and no clear space where children can be children.

I want to put the power back in parents’ hands so they can better manage the pressures on their children and make it easier for them to bring up their children the way they want.

Parents need encouragement to feel they can change things and that their voices will be heard. Regulators, businesses and broadcasters should do more to connect with parents - it’s not enough for them to work out what is acceptable from what people complain about afterwards. I hope that they see that it’s good business if you look out for families. Then we can all help to make Britain a more family friendly place.

Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said:

I’m very grateful to Reg for his insightful and thorough review, and for recommending a set of practical measures to help parents protect their children in the increasingly sexual and commercial world we live in.

It is not government’s role to interfere in family life. But parents often tell me that they would like more support so that they can navigate the rapidly-changing technological and commercial world. Reg’s review shows the way for business and government to give them this support.

I know that Reg has encountered a lot of goodwill from the broadcast, retail and advertising industries throughout his review. I am looking forward to working together to implement his proposals.

Ed Vaizey, Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries, said:

We know that many parents are concerned that their children could be exposed to content that seems too adult, be it online, on TV, through adverts or in music videos. I welcome the collaborative way that regulators and industry have engaged with Reg Bailey. For our part, we are committed to consulting on whether age ratings on music videos would provide effective protection for children.

Many of the actions suggested in the report are for businesses and regulators rather than for the government. Reg Bailey is recommending that the government should monitor the implementation of his recommendations and do a stock-take in 18 months’ time. To make sure that good progress is made quickly, the prime minister and children’s minister will invite a wide range of businesses and regulators into Downing Street in October and ask them to report on steps they have taken to address the issues raised in this report.

The British Retail Consortium (BRC) has today published new family-friendly guidelines which Mr Bailey welcomes as a clear example of how industry can respond positively and voluntarily to public feeling. He recommends all retailers should sign up to the guidelines.

Jane Bevis, Director of Public Affairs at the BRC, said:

This has been an important review in considering the needs of children and families in an increasingly complex world. We have been delighted to work closely with Reg and his team as they have examined some real and challenging issues and debunked a number of urban myths.

It has highlighted the excellent practice already in place in responsible retailers - and the need to share this more widely so that parents can be confident when shopping.

Our good practice guidelines on childrenswear, launched alongside Reg’s report today, aim to ensure that the highest standards are maintained across the sector.

Guy Parker, Chief Executive of the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), said:

The protection of children from harmful or inappropriate advertising is one of the Advertising Standards Authority’s top priorities and to do this we know we need to reflect the views of parents and young people in our work.

We welcome Reg Bailey’s recommendations on advertising and we’re committed to making sure that parents have the confidence to raise their concerns and to know that they’ll be heard.

Chris Woolard, Group Director of Content at Ofcom, said:

Protection of children is one of Ofcom’s most important statutory duties and we therefore welcome Reg Bailey’s review of this significant area.

Ofcom recognises the critical importance of parents’ views about what children watch on TV. We will continue to focus on exploring parents’ views in our enforcement of broadcasting standards relating to the protection of children.

The Bailey review listened to the views of parents, children and young people through a range of ways including face-to-face surveys, a call for evidence and focus groups. The Office of the Children’s Commissioner for England also submitted the views of 552 children and young people, published in a report today.

TheBailey Review of Commercialisation and Sexualisation of Childhood - Letting Children be Children, was published on Monday 6 June 2011.

Reg Bailey was asked to lead the independent review on 6 December 2010.

Contributions to the review included:
* 1000 parents completed an online call for evidence.
* 1025 parents of five to 16-year-olds and 520 children and young people aged seven to 16 took part in a face-to-face survey.
* 70 parents took part in qualitative research, including focus groups.
* 552 children and young people took part in a survey by the Office of the Children’s Commissioner for England.
* 120 organisations and businesses submitted written evidence.
* Over 40 organisations and experts held individual meetings with Reg Bailey.

The UK 2010 A level, AS level and Advanced Diploma results were published today by the Joint Council for Qualifications - which represents the largest qualification awarding organisations in the country.

It is the first year the new A* grades and the new A2 exams, designed to stretch and challenge the brightest students, have been awarded. It is also the first year young people have been awarded the new Advanced Diploma.

Schools Minister Nick Gibb said:

All students who received their A and AS level results today know how hard they have worked and I’d like to congratulate them on their achievement. A levels are an important milestone in life and open up great opportunities for academic study in higher education and for future careers. I’d also like to thank the teachers, schools, colleges and parents who have put so much effort into preparing young people.

Despite everyone’s hard work there is still much work to be done. England has one of the most stratified and segregated school systems in the world. It is scandalous that of the 80,000 students in one year eligible for free school meals, just 45 got to Oxbridge. The Coalition government is committed to all young people, regardless of their background, having the best opportunity to achieve success. That is why we are determined to narrow the historic and entrenched attainment gap between those from the poorest and most wealthy backgrounds.

Tackling this inequality of opportunity is the driving force behind the Coalition’s reform agenda: giving schools the freedom to offer the best exams and to set their own priorities; creating a strong core curriculum which gives children the knowledge to think for themselves and allows teachers to inspire their pupils; introducing the Pupil Premium to give support to the most disadvantaged; and strengthening vocational qualifications, including the setting up of new technical academies and the expansion of apprenticeships.

A levels are a crucial measurement of academic achievement. We will work with universities and employers to ensure that it meets their needs in the future.

Mr Gibb said:

The A* grade represents genuine top-level attainment. The most competitive universities have long wanted to differentiate between top performing students. The previous Government introduced the A* to help them do this. It is now down to universities to decide how they use it.

Mr Gibb said:

There will be a place for the Diploma as long as there is demand for it. It is for schools, colleges and students to decide whether it is the best qualification for them. That’s why we have made it easier for schools and colleges to choose the Diplomas they think are right for their students, rather than having to offer them in every subject. We want to strengthen vocational education so we will look carefully at how these qualifications are viewed by employers and universities.

There advice for parents and young people available.

The Coalition: Our programme for Government

The Coalition: Our Programme for Government published on 20th May 2010 pledges:
* We will publish performance data on educational providers, as well as past exam papers.* We will create more flexibility in the exams systems so that state schools can offer qualifications like the iGCSE.* We will reform league tables so that schools are able to focus on, and demonstrate, the progress of children of all abilities.* We will improve the quality of vocational education, including increasing flexibility for 14-19 year olds and creating new technical academies as part of our plans to diversify schools provision.* We will seek ways to support the creation of apprenticeships, internships, work pairings, and college and workplace training places as part of our wider programme to get Britain working.

The first five Diplomas (engineering; IT; creative and media; construction and the built environment; society, health and development) have been taught in schools and colleges since September 2008. Five more Diplomas were introduced in September 2009 (hair and beauty studies; environment and land-based studies; hospitality; business, administration and finance; manufacturing and product design). The further four Diplomas will be first taught from September 2010 (travel and tourism; public services; retail business; sport and active leisure).The Government announced on 7th June 2010 that development of ‘Phase 4’ (‘academic’) Diplomas in science, languages and humanities, due to be first taught from September 2011, would be stopped. See the press notice ‘Government announces changes to qualifications and the curriculum’ for more information.The Government announced on 24th June 2010 that the development of Extended Diploma and entitlement to all Diploma lines of learning in all schools and colleges will be stopped.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-than-1-in-10-secondary-schools-now-academies-with-many-more-in-the-pipeline,Press release,More than 1 in 10 secondary schools now academies with many more in the pipeline,Over 400 academies are now open – double the figure open in May 2010.,Department for Education and The Rt Hon Michael Gove,6 January 2011,"Figures released today show momentum is building for the government’s flagship school reform. The government announced today that:

In addition, the Department is also working with academy sponsors who have targeted underperforming schools. Plans are advanced to reopen these schools as academies in the coming academic year.

Michael Gove today congratulated the schools becoming academies this term:

I am delighted that more schools are opening as academies this week, and are now free from central and local bureaucratic control.

Schools are taking up our offer to become academies because they recognise the huge benefits of being an academy - more autonomy, more power to teachers, and an opportunity to thrive, free from interference from government.

The Coalition believes that headteachers and teachers - not politicians and bureaucrats - know best how to run schools. That’s why all school now have the opportunity to become academies, with stronger schools supporting weaker ones.

Heads of the new academies today spoke of their excitement as their schools become academies this week.

Mike Crawshaw, Head of Debenham High School, Suffolk, said:

We’ve always worked hard to give our parents what they want - an outstanding school on their doorstep, with excellent teaching and the opportunities for their children to succeed, whatever their talents and interests. But as we’ve improved, expectations of what we do and aspirations for what we can achieve have rightly risen with them.

So that’s why we’ve decided to become an academy now. It will give us more day-to-day control to give families the sort of education they want - a broad, balanced and relevant curriculum; strong and clear discipline; extra academic and pastoral support for children that need it; and thriving music, sport and activities outside class. It is a clear vote of confidence in our staff’s skill and abilities - that we are trusted by government to make the right calls for our pupils.

Paula Humphreys, Head of The Broxbourne School, Hertfordshire, said:

The governing body believes that we have the experience and expertise to use the additional autonomies of academy status to continue the development of the school; to further raise standards; and to be more proactive in responding to the needs of the local community: leading in raising attainment and removing barriers to learning. The additional freedoms open to us as an academy and our commitment to cooperation with other schools and agencies will be important components in the school’s work at the heart of the community.

Martin Watson, Head of Lavington School, Wiltshire, said:

The governors made this decision because we believe the school knows best what is needed to provide an outstanding education to our students. We intend to better tailor our curriculum to best provide for all abilities.

The freedoms around pay and conditions will enable us to reward those staff who take on additional responsibilities not covered in the TLR structure. Being an academy also enables us to continue and even expand our work with other schools for mutual development and improvement.

Gary Longman, Head of The King’s (The Cathedral) School, Peterborough, said:

The governing body of The King’s (The Cathedral) School, Peterborough is delighted that the school acquired academy status on 1 January 2011. As an outstanding school the governors believe that the new status will give them the best opportunity to maintain, and indeed raise, current standards and protect all they cherish about Peterborough’s Cathedral School founded by Henry VIII in 1541.

Although the school will gain a further degree of independence we look towards developing the existing collaborative arrangements with other schools in the locality. We believe that we will be able, in these difficult times, to target resources wisely to the benefit of our pupils. In the short term we hope to provide additional one-to-one support for a number of pupils in mathematics and English, in addition to protecting our existing curriculum and class sizes. This is an exciting phase in the long and rich history of the school.

John Townsley, Head of Morley High School, Leeds, said:

Becoming an academy is of immense importance to Morley High School. We will re-open as The Morley Academy this week and, as a direct consequence of our change of status, we will begin to play an even greater part in transforming the educational experience of thousands of young people.

As an Outstanding school we are being given greater freedom and trust and we intend to use that freedom to maximum effect. Already an organisation with a track record of highly effective intervention in less effective schools, we will now drive forward with an even greater sense of purpose in this area. We remain convinced that so much is to be gained from highly effective schools working in partnership with less effective schools to raise standards of achievement. Becoming an academy provides us with the flexibility and additional resourcing to work on a number of fronts with a range of partners in a manner which will have an enormous impact on so many students. This will include the appointment of new colleagues who will be employed to work both at The Morley Academy and partner schools.

Bob Mitchell, Head of Bodmin College, Cornwall, said:

Academy status will give us the freedom to allocate all resources at our disposal to be directly beneficial to our students. We can offer extended opportunities, not only to students at Bodmin College, but to students across our networks.

The key driver for this decision rests with the belief that becoming an academy will give the College full control of local decision making, hence becoming more effective and efficient in the delivery of a 21st century educational offer for everyone at the College and within the community.

Further information on academies that have converted can be found onthe academies section of the Department for Education’s websiteincluding interviews with headteachers explaining the benefits of attaining academy status:  As of 5 January 2011 there were
* 390 applications to become academies (including those that have opened already)
* 248 academy orders had been signed.

The total number of academies now open is 407. This is made up of
* 203 academies set up by the last government
* 204 academies set up by the Coalition. Of this 204, 68 are sponsored academies, replacing schools that are underperforming, and 136 are schools converting to academy status.

Lists of all open academies and schools progressing towards conversion are available to download from the academies section of this DfE’s website.

The Taskforce has seen increasing numbers of complaints in relation to cancellations and refunds, which now account for 4 out of 5 complaints being received. So far, concerns include people being pressured to accept vouchers for holiday accommodation which can only be used during a more expensive period, wedding venues refusing to refund any money and telling people to claim on their insurance, and nurseries asking people to pay very high sums in order to keep a place open for their child.

Based on the complaints received, the CMA has identified 3 sectors of particular concern:

The CMA will tackle these areas as a priority and then move on to examine other sectors, based on the information received by the CMA COVID-19 Taskforce.

The CMA acknowledges that most businesses are trying to do the right thing in these unprecedented circumstances but, at the same time, ordinary consumers deserve to have their rights protected. It also advises that businesses should not be profiting by ‘double recovering’ their money from the Government and from customers.

If it finds evidence that companies are failing to comply with the law, the CMA will take appropriate enforcement action, which could include taking a firm to court if it does not address its concerns.

As well as examining specific sectors, the CMA is todayissuing a statementon its views on consumer protection law in relation to cancellations and refunds during the current crisis.

The statement covers a range of consumer contracts and different situations. It includes that, in most cases, the CMA would expect a full refund to be offered if:

a business has cancelled a contract without providing any of the promised goods or services

no service is provided by a business, because this is prevented by restrictions that apply during the current lockdown or

a consumer cancels, or is prevented from receiving any services, because of the restrictions that apply during the current lockdown

Andrea Coscelli, CEO of the CMA, said:

Our COVID-19 taskforce is shining a light on some of the big issues facing consumers in wake of this pandemic. We are now seeing cancellation issues in their thousands. So far, the CMA has identified weddings, holiday accommodation and childcare as particular areas of concern.

The current situation is throwing up challenges for everyone, including businesses, but that does not mean that consumers should be deprived of their rights at this difficult time. If we find evidence that businesses are failing to comply with consumer protection law then we will take tough enforcement action to protect those rights.

If people have been affected by unfair cancellation terms in wake of coronavirus, they can report them to the CMA using theonline form.

Whilst the CMA is not able to respond directly to every complaint it receives, the information provided will help the CMA to decide which issues to address as part of this rolling programme of work."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-plans-allow-schools-to-employ-overseas-teachers-more-easily,News story,New plans allow schools to employ overseas teachers more easily,"Details of Michael Gove's announcement about making it easier for schools to employ teachers from Australia, New Zealand, USA, and Canada.",Department for Education,23 May 2011,"Despite having undertaken training to achieve equivalent teacher training qualifications, qualified teachers from America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand still have to undertake further training and assessment before they are deemed ready to teach in schools in this country.

Michael Gove has today announced that the government intends to make changes so that teachers trained in these countries will be able to teach in our schools automatically. We will consult on how best to achieve this change later in the year. Speaking in Parliament today he said:

One of the aims of my department is to make sure that the most talented people possible are teaching our children and it is already the case that teachers from the European Economic Area can teach in our schools.

Today I want to extend that freedom to teachers from the Commonwealth countries such as Canada and New Zealand and Australia and I hope that other Commonwealth countries like South Africa, Jamaica and Singapore can join in due course.

Research looking at international teaching qualifications shows America, Australia, Canada and New Zealand have teacher training systems that are equivalent to those in the UK. Ministers therefore will be amending the relevant regulations to recognise the qualifications held in these countries. This will allow well-trained teachers from these countries to work in schools as if they held qualified teacher status.

The school or local authority sponsoring the teacher will have to continue to check the suitability of the teacher including their qualifications and any necessary background checks. In addition they will still have to meet existing immigration criteria set out by the UK Border Agency (UKBA).

The proposed changes are subject to a statutory consultation and could come into effect from early 2012. Ministers have also commissioned further research to see if the same changes could be applied to teachers from any other countries in future.

The London Enterprise Fund is intended to provide specific, targeted support for Tottenham and Croydon to arrest and reverse economic decline, provide immediate investment and boost the local economies.

Tottenham and Croydon bore the brunt of the recent disturbances. The riots served to compound existing economic pressures in what are already challenging business environments.

The flexible, unringfenced funding that the Communities Secretary is making available today is intended to address the long standing barriers to growth in these two specific areas. It will support them in maximising their potential, establishing economic identities that will put them on the map and creating apprenticeships and job opportunities for local residents.

The experience of the two boroughs, compared to others in west and central London, shows how growth across the capital in recent years has been uneven. Ministers want to ensure that all boroughs are able to benefit from growth and believe that the funding announced today will help achieve this.

The Government will make available £20m of funding to the Greater London Authority. This will enable the Mayor and partners to get started immediately to work with the areas to develop plans. The proposals will be worked up further with the boroughs concerned but it is anticipated that the money may be used to:

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

Just as we want the whole of the country to share in the benefits of economic growth so too do we want the whole of the capital to be thriving. London is a success story but it is a story that reads very differently depending on which borough you are in. This immediate investment will breathe new life into both Tottenham and Croydon, enable them to get to grips with the unique challenges they face and move swiftly and quickly to maximise their own potential for economic success.

The Communities Secretary was joined in Tottenham today by the Mayor of London to announce this package of support.

Boris Johnson said:

We will rebuild and repair every part of our city that has been damaged and help London’s businesses get back on their feet. For the most badly affected areas, Tottenham and Croydon, it is vital we also use the opportunity to deliver long term improvements and create new jobs and skills that will benefit these communities for generations to come. With this support from Government, we can not only restore these town centres but create better, more prosperous places to live, work and invest in.

The £20 million funding will be made available over the next three years for specific, swift action that will deliver longer term regeneration. It comes in addition to the £50 million recovery funding the Government announced last week to give immediate support to areas across the country affected by the disturbances and help them get back on their feet. The London Enterprise Fund is closely aligned with the Mayor of London’s £50 million high street improvement package announced last week that will ensure that areas right across the capital are able to access support.

The tailored package of support for Tottenham and Croydon comes on the day that the Government has announced 11 new Enterprise Zones to accelerate local growth as part of the Plan for Growth. The press notice is available here:www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1967595.

Notes to editors

The Mayors office will be working closely with the Department for Communities and Local Government, Boroughs and local representatives to agree funding priorities and proposals. The decisions will be made in partnership with local councils and those communities affected. All proposals will have to demonstrate value for money in terms of the benefits to affected areas.

The £20m London Enterprise Fund announced today will complement the £50 million fund that the Mayor of London announced last week to help make major long term improvements to the capital’s town centres and high streets damaged by the recent disturbances ensuring that all parts of the capital are able to access financial support.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/minister-tim-loughton-writes-to-the-daily-mail,Government response,Minister Tim Loughton writes to the 'Daily Mail',"Letter from Minister Tim Loughton following an opinion piece from Christopher Booker on the care system that was published in the 'Daily Mail' on Friday, 13 April 2012.",Department for Education and Tim Loughton,17 April 2012,"Sir,

Christopher Booker painted his usual highly selective and misleading picture of the care system (Friday 13 April, ‘Children Stolen by the State’). His emotive use of the word snatched is incorrect - no child is snatched from their parents, all care cases have to go through comprehensive court proceedings.

He has previous form on this subject, having repeatedly made similar allegations without substance or evidence.

I am quite clear that as the Children’s Minister, my first priority is to make sure we support vulnerable families to stay together. No one benefits if a child is taken into care incorrectly, but if a child’s safety is threatened the next step must be to consider care urgently. This isn’t a numbers game - there are no targets - it is about taking the right children into care.

These decisions are incredibly hard for social workers. The recent BBC documentary, _‘_Protecting our Children’, showed social workers doing everything they could to keep families together. But there were, sadly, times when they had to intervene. The decision is not a science. Social workers, courts and other agencies make very complex judgements on a daily basis and get it right in the vast majority of cases.

In fact, most children in care will return to their families when it is safe to do so. Others may need some time in foster care or a children’s home. For others still, adoption will be the best solution if there is no safe way back to their birth families. What is important is that the most vulnerable children are found loving homes quickly rather than being left in limbo for long periods of time.

In his columns, Christopher Booker has been right to raise this issue of when the wrong decision is taken, but he also has a responsibility to report the full picture. These cases are exceptionally rare.

The government is constantly looking at how to improve the system. We need better checks and balances. I am working with judges, local authorities, voluntary organisations and parents to continue making the system better. We are also working to improve safeguarding and social work practice, and I want to see greater transparency in the family courts.

It’s important that these issues are raised, but it’s equally important that a minority of distressing cases are not manipulated to discredit the entire system. I am sure that Christopher Booker would be the first to argue that social workers and the courts acted too slowly should another tragic child protection case occur that could have been avoided. Trying to caricature all social workers as some sort of ‘child snatcher’ is deeply irresponsible and dangerous for children like Baby P, who cannot safely live with their parents and where we have a duty to intervene before it is too late.

Across local authorities there has been a concern that the children’s services assessment is essentially a bureaucratic exercise that adds little understanding of children’s services in an area over and above the individual inspections that underlie it. It is seen to make little if any contribution t to driving service improvement. Ending the annual children’s services assessment will create cost savings to Ofsted of approximately £1.6 million per year.

Following an 8-week targeted consultation exercise, the government has today laid the draft Legislative Reform (Annual Review of Local Authorities) Order before Parliament. Subject to Parliamentary approval, the government expects to effect the repeal of the legislation requiring annual children’s services assessments to be conducted - section 138 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 - before Parliament breaks for summer recess on 17 July.

Ofsted currently carries out a review every year of the overall performance of each local authority in England as regards the delivery of children’s services.  It then awards each authority a performance rating in respect of the matters reviewed. The duty requiring this is set out in the Education and Inspections Act 2006. The annual children’s services assessment provides, for each top tier local authority in England, a summary of the outcomes of the inspections of services and settings carried out by Ofsted during the year and an analysis of the performance data related to each authority.  Ratings are awarded on a four-point scale:

(1) performs poorly

(2) performs adequately

(3) performs well

(4) performs excellently

This will follow a pre-appointment hearing in front of the Education Select Committee and approval by the Privy Council.

Sir Michael has a long and distinguished career in education. He has worked as a teacher for 42 years, including 25 years as a headteacher in London secondary schools. He was knighted in 2000 for services to education.

Sir Michael has turned around some of the most challenging schools in some of the poorest parts of London. Under his leadership, Mossbourne Academy - which opened on the site of a failing school - has achieved:

Mossbourne has also been approved to open a new academy in Hackney in 2014, to spread its excellent provision further.

Education Secretary Michael Gove said:

I cannot think of a better person to lead Ofsted than Sir Michael Wilshaw. He is one of the best educators of his generation.

Sir Michael has transformed the fortunes of thousands of children during his time as a headteacher. He truly understands what success looks like and knows how to achieve it - even in the most challenging circumstances. This role will allow more heads, teachers and other professionals to be influenced by this talented and inspirational leader.

I have every confidence that his appointment will help to raise standards in education and children’s services in England.

Baroness Sally Morgan, Chair of Ofsted, said:

This is a great appointment. With his commitment to improving the lives of the most disadvantaged young people, Sir Michael will bring exactly the right experience to Ofsted.

I look forward to welcoming Sir Michael to Ofsted once the Education Select Committee has the opportunity to reflect on the appointment.

Sir Michael Wilshaw said:

I am honoured and privileged to be appointed to this most important and influential post.

As HMCI, I will endeavour not only to provide a commentary on educational standards but also to challenge the service to provide consistently high quality provision for young people and adults.

I look forward to working with HMI and inspectors as well as government and other key stakeholders in this great endeavour.

Sir Michael will preside over a new, more targeted and proportionate inspection system for schools, subject to the passage of the Education Bill. He will also be responsible for Ofsted’s wide range of other inspection and regulatory duties.

The Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skillsregulates and inspects to achieve excellence in the care of children and young people, and in education and skills for learners of all ages. It regulates and inspects childcare and children’s social care, and inspects the Children and Family Court Advisory Support Service (Cafcass), schools, colleges, initial teacher training, work-based learning and skills training, adult and community learning, and education and training in prisons and other secure establishments. It assesses council children’s services, and inspects services for looked after children, safeguarding and child protection.

The appointment process was run in accordance with the Code of Practice issued by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments (OCPA) and was made on merit: political activity played no part in the selection process. However, in accordance with the original Nolan recommendations and the code of practice, there is a requirement for appointees’ political activity (if any declared), and other information, to be made public. Sir Michael Wilshaw has declared no political affiliations.

As a result of an open competition process, the Secretary of State has recommended the appointment Sir Michael Wilshaw. The proposed appointee will be subject to a pre-appointment hearing by the Education Select Committee and the final stage in the appointment process is to secure an Order in Council through an application to the Privy Council.

Subject to public appointment requirements, Sir Michael is expected to take up the position from January 2012. He will succeed Miriam Rosen, who was appointed as Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector in July 2011 on an interim basis.

Sir Michael has worked as a teacher for 42 years, including 25 years as a headteacher in London secondary schools. He was knighted in 2000 for services to education.

Sir Michael is also the Director of Education at ARK (Absolute Return for Kids). ARK runs nine academies and two Free Schools. It has a track record of turning around underperforming schools and saw an 11 percentage point increase in its five A* to C (including English and maths) GCSE results this year.

Subject to his appointment, Sir Michael will leave his current posts before starting in his new role at Ofsted.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/early-learning-and-childrens-centres-government-sets-out-reform,Press release,Early learning and children’s centres: government sets out reform,"Reforms include a slimmed down curriculum for 0-5-year-olds, more focus on getting children ready for school and free childcare to be more flexible.",Department for Education and Sarah Teather,6 July 2011,"A new, slimmed down early years curriculum for 0-5-year-olds, more focused on making sure children start school ready and able to learn, will be introduced next year under changes set out today by Children’s Minister Sarah Teather.

Responding to the Tickell Review of the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), the new framework radically reduces the number of early learning goals from 69 to 17. It focuses on three prime areas of learning critical to making sure children develop healthily and happily. These areas form the foundations on which children can then master the basic literacy skills they need for school.

Parents will also get much clearer information on how their children are doing with the introduction of a new progress check for every two-year-old in early education. Parents and professionals can be confident children are developing well and any problems will be picked up early.

As part of wider reforms to Sure Start Children’s Centres and early learning, the Government is looking at ways to get parents and communities more involved in running children’s centres. New plans to be consulted on will also make it easier for parents to plan and balance their working lives by making the free entitlement to 15 hours of early learning and childcare more flexible.

In addition, the Government has made £3million available this year for up to 30 local areas to trial payment by results in children’s centres. The trials will look at how to reward local authorities and centres on how well they reach and support the most vulnerable families to narrow gaps in child development, raise attainment at the end of the foundation years and improve family health and wellbeing.

The key proposals outlined today include:

Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said:

The first five years of a child’s life, the foundation years, are absolutely critical. We want a system where every child can thrive, regardless of their social background. If we are to tackle the attainment gap and raise life chances, we must start in the earliest years.

We know experiences in these first years have the biggest impact on how a child’s brain develops. It’s when children grasp the fundamental skills needed to do well at school and develop as happy, confident individuals. That’s why today I am setting out a much slimmer, easier to understand early years curriculum. It will give professionals more freedom in how they work with children, and will involve parents more in their child’s learning. Fundamentally, it will make sure we are preparing our children for the challenges of school and beyond. This isn’t just about making sure they can hold a pencil - children need the resilience, confidence and personal skills to be able to learn.

Children’s centres are where much of this work takes place. We want them to be places where communities come together, parents can support each other and children can develop. That’s why we are looking at how to give parents more say in the running of their local children’s centre. This could be through governing bodies, or a co-operative approach where parents are involved in day to day decisions. We are also providing £3million this year for up to 30 new pilots where local councils will be paid for the results they achieve.

Finally, we want to make sure parents get the help and support they need to bring up their children and balance work and family life. Proposed changes to the free entitlement hours will help make sure more children can benefit from early education and parents can juggle their working hours more effectively.

Dame Clare Tickell published her independent review of the Early Years Foundation Stage in March this year. The Government agrees with Tickell that the current system is overly bureaucratic, repetitive and not as parent friendly as it should be. The revised framework is published today on the Department’s website.

Evidence shows that making a difference to children’s achievement in the early years is critical. Pupils who start off in the bottom 20 per cent of attainment at the EYFS profile aged five are six times more likely to be in the bottom 20 per cent at Key Stage 1. Feinstein’s research shows that parental interest in their child’s education has four times more influence on attainment by age 16 than socio-economic background. The new framework will free up professionals to spend more time working with children helping them to develop and the new two-year-old check will ensure parents are properly engaged in their child’s development.

The Government’s reform of children’s centres and the EYFS is part of wider work on a new vision for Families in the Foundation Years. More detail on how the Government plans to support parents will be published in the next few weeks.

Dame Clare Tickell said:

I am very pleased that the Government has accepted the recommendations of my review in such a comprehensive way.

As well as the agreement to slim down the bureaucracy, I know that the decision to support my recommendation for a check for all two-year-olds will make a real difference. We now have a golden opportunity to identify not only any potential developmental and special educational needs children have, but crucially to help parents who need additional support too.

The earliest years in a child’s life provide the foundation for everything that follows. We must make sure that children are supported and encouraged to achieve their full potential as inquisitive, confident and secure individuals.

Anand Shukla, acting Chief executive of Daycare Trust commented:

We warmly welcome today’s government announcement on the free early years entitlement, which Daycare Trust has recommended for some time. Our research shows that while there are currently high levels of take up of the free entitlement, many families do not use the whole 15 hours of free education and care that they are entitled to, because it does not fit with parents’ working patterns.

We also know that there is a huge gap in childcare provision for parents working outside of typical 8am-6pm hours. By allowing the free entitlement to be used over a minimum of two days rather than three, and from 7am-7pm, both parents and children stand to benefit.

The introduction of, and ongoing commitment to, the free early years entitlement has been one the most important family-friendly policies in recent years and we are pleased to see the government continue to build upon this very successful policy. These proposed changes, if adopted, will bring substantial benefits to the lives of hard-pressed families across the country.

The revisedEarly Years Foundation Stage Framework(EYFS) has been published for consultation on this website. The new framework will be implemented from September 2012.

The newcore purpose of children’s centres, published today for consultation, sets out the Government’s overall goal for children’s centres, and draws on the views of experts in the sector to set out how children’s centres can achieve this. The core purpose of children’s centres is:
* Child development and school readiness - supporting communication, emotional, physical and social development so children start school confident and able to learn.
* Parenting aspirations and parenting skills - helping parents to maximise their skills and give their children the best start.
* Child and family health and life chances - promoting good physical and mental health for children and their parents, including addressing risk factors early on.

The Government extended the free entitlement for all three- and four-year-olds to 15 hours a week from September last year. From 2013, all disadvantaged two-year-olds will benefit. The Government will be consulting on changes to the flexibility of the free entitlement in the autumn.

Local authorities who will be taking part in the Payment by Results trials will be announced in the summer, alongside the criteria they will be measured against. The Government wants to use payment by results as an incentive for areas to focus on the new proposed core purpose of children’s centres, to improve child development and school readiness among young children and to reduce inequalities.

There is a wealth of research available that supports investment in the early years and how critical those first 5 years are for children’s development and future success. The most recent reports from the Department can be found on thepublications sectionof this website.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/childrens-minister-unveils-plans-for-education-of-sen-pupils,Press release,Children’s Minister unveils plans for education of SEN pupils,Sarah Teather: Improving the special educational needs (SEN) system will put parents in control of their child’s education.,Department for Education and Sarah Teather,10 September 2010,"Ministers are considering how to ensure parents can send their child with SEN or disabilities to their preferred educational setting - whether that is a mainstream school, special school or an academy.

The plans were outlined today as Children’s Minister Sarah Teather called on parents, charities, teachers and LAs to contribute to the Government’s SEN Green Paper.

The Green Paper, to be published in the autumn, aims to improve radically the entire SEN system and will cover issues including school choice, early identification and assessment, funding and family support.

Ministers are considering a range of options including how to

Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said:

Children with special educational needs and disabilities should have the same opportunities as other children, but the current system is so adversarial that too often this doesn’t happen. I want parents, teachers, charities, teaching unions and local authorities to come forward with the changes they think are needed to make the system better for children with SEN and their families.

Parents should be in control of their child’s education and future. Importantly, they must be involved in discussions and decisions about the support they need rather than feel they have to battle the system. I want to make it easier for parents to choose where their child is educated.

I want to look at every aspect of SEN - from assessment and identification to funding and education. We need to strip away the cumbersome bureaucracy but ensure there is a better, more comprehensive service for families.

Christine Lenehan, Director, Council for Disabled Children, said:

CDC is delighted by the Government’s continued focus on the needs of disabled children and those with SEN. We hope people involved in the lives of disabled children take this opportunity to respond to the call for views.

Julie Jennings, Chair, Special Educational Consortium, said:

I am delighted that disabled children and children with special educational needs have been made a high priority by the Government. I am pleased, too, that there is no suggestion that we are starting from a blank sheet of paper - so much evidence has been brought together over the last few years that this invitation to contribute to the Green Paper is rightly focused on setting priorities and practical action that is going to make a real difference.

To support fundamental changes to the SEN and disability system, ministers are looking at how to identify children’s needs earlier, develop fairer and more transparent funding arrangements, and streamline assessments to make life easier for parents and families.

Ministers are seeking a wide range of views to help them develop proposals for consultation that are practical to implement, reduce bureaucracy and build on current effective practice as well as make the most of the available funds.

Alongside the launch of the Call for Views, the Children’s Minister today confirmed the end of the national disabled children’s services parental survey. Only a limited number of parents could respond to the survey and ministers want all parents to have the opportunity to get involved in how local services are designed and delivered. The Government welcomes views on how to strengthen the process for ensuring parents’ views affect the services their family receives locally.

This new data comes as part of the Department’s contribution to the Coalition Government’s commitment on transparency, openness and accountability. In addition, for the first time ever, parents will be able to use the Department’s website to create their own performance tables that rank local schools or to compare them with others.

The figures published show

Education Secretary Michael Gove said:

This is the most detail parents and the public have ever had about how children are performing in England’s secondary schools.

Children, parents and schools should be proud of their results, which have been achieved through all the hard work they have put in. But as the international evidence from PISA shows us, England still lags behind other nations. We have not succeeded in closing the gap and in raising attainment for all students.

That’s why we are reforming our school system by learning from the best-performing countries. In nearly every other developed country in the world children are assessed in a range of core academic subjects at 15 or 16. That is why the Coalition introduced the English Baccalaureate as a measure of performance.

The key performance measure remains the number of children who get 5 A* to C passes at GCSE including English and maths.

I am open to arguments about how we can further improve every measure in the performance tables - including the English Baccalaureate. But I am determined to ensure that our exam standards match the highest standards around the world.

Sue John, Headteacher of Lampton School in Hounslow, said:

We are pleased to support the introduction of the English Baccalaureate. Lampton is a complex, urban comprehensive academy but we strongly believe that our students should be academically stretched and have the same life chances as students from more affluent areas. It is our policy to ensure that all students have an entitlement to pursue a broad and balanced curriculum. Their prospects of social mobility are enhanced by studying a humanities subject and a modern foreign language, in addition to English, maths and science. We already know that universities value these subjects and take them into account either officially or unofficially when deciding to offer places to students.

Barry Day, Chief Executive of the Greenwood Academies Trust, multiple sponsor with academies only in deprived areas including the Nottingham Academy - which has 35% of its children on free school meals, said:

The government is sending a clear and welcome message that those of us working in education must have higher expectations for young people. At the moment far too many students, especially from more deprived communities, are pushed through courses that will not help them continue in education or get a job.

It is unacceptable that after years of big budget increase there are still a couple of hundred schools where fewer than 35% of pupils achieve 5 good GCSEs including English and maths and are failing to make an average level of progress. This level of performance should be considered a bare minimum. I know from my experience of taking over underperforming schools that there are no excuses for such poor attainment.

It’s also right that the government should be encouraging, via the English Baccalaureate, the take-up of tougher subjects like modern languages. Young people whose parents can’t afford private schools - where such subjects are offered to all as a matter of course - will see a huge benefit; and many more will be able to access courses at our best universities as a result.

The spending data published alongside the performance data will allow parents, researchers and the general public for the first time to

For example, a parent could compare how well their school performs compared to other schools nearby. They will know for the first time whether the school down the road is doing twice as well with much less money. Schools can compare how they are spending their money compared to other schools.

Michael Gove added:

Publishing all this information is a dramatic step change in the accountability of the school system. The aim of publishing the school-by-school spending data is not to point fingers, but to ensure we better understand how the best and most effective schools achieve what they achieve with the money and resources they have.

The coalition government has protected the overall school budgets for the next 4 years and are investing an additional £3.6 billion, which includes the pupil premium targeted at disadvantaged pupils. We need to ensure that every pound is spent as effectively as possible and the best way of doing that is by shining a light on the best practice within the existing schools system, allowing headteachers, governors and parents to learn from the best.

We hope this data, along with the new performance measures, will drive forward an appetite for people to ask for more data. The Department for Education will make available to whoever asks for it data so that people can construct their own performance tables based on a range of measures they want.

This is one of the exciting things the coalition government is doing - empowering parents, the profession and wider public to judge schools in the way they consider appropriate.

William Simmonds, Chief Executive of the National Association of School Business Management, said:

NASBM welcomes the publication of the school spending data. It’s an important tool in helping parents see how their child’s school spends their money, so they can be confident it has supported teaching and learning. The data also helps schools compare themselves to others in similar circumstances, continually encouraging them to make efficiency savings. The role of the school business manager is crucial to a well financially managed school - that is why it is important that all schools have access to one to ensure that best value is achieved and that money is delivered to the frontline for the benefit of the pupils.

Schools are defined as being below the floor if

It does not include independent schools, closed schools, special schools, schools with fewer than 11 pupils, schools with lost results and schools that are not published in the performance tables.

In recent years there has been a huge drop off in the number of children studying academic subjects. In 2004 around 15,000 non-academic qualifications were taken in schools. By 2010 this had risen to around 575,000 - mostly at age 16 - a 3,800% increase.

The number of children taking any GCSEs in science or a modern foreign language has fallen:

The situation is worse for the poorest - in 2009 just 4% of children on free school meals took chemistry or physics. Fewer than one in five did history and fewer than 15% took geography or French. Just 24% of FSM pupils entered an MFL subject, compared with 43% of non-FSM pupils doing likewise.

In France all children take the ‘Brevet des Colleges’, which assesses French, mathematics, history/geography/civics and a modern foreign language.

In Asia there is typically assessment of the whole core curriculum at GCSE level. In Singapore, for example, all pupils must take English, another language, mathematics, science, humanities, plus one other subject. And in the United States nearly all schools have mandatory assessment during high school in mathematics, English, science and social studies including history and politics.

Releasing these new data sets are part of the Department’s contribution to the coalition government’s commitment to greater transparency. All the school spend data for LA-maintained primary and secondary schools is also being made available in raw format so that it can be manipulated according to people’s interests and needs.

This is just the beginning of a move towards greater openness with government data on education. In the future, parents, school staff, researchers and statisticians will have

In the meantime, researchers and statistician can request the raw data on school attainment from the Department.

Drivers will benefit from smoother, easier journeys thanks to the government’s new plan for drivers, including £70 million to keep traffic flowing and measures to speed up the rollout of electric vehicle charging.

The plan includes measures that could help councils increase spending on fixing potholes and road repairs by more than £100 million over 10 years, fining roadworks which overrun, new technology to simplify parking payment and updating 20mph zone guidance for England to prevent inappropriate blanket use

The government has also today committed to exploring measures to speed up the installation of chargepoints for electric vehicles and extending grants to schools to install chargepoints.

Transport Secretary Mark Harper said:

We’re backing drivers and our new long-term plan will improve journeys for millions across the country, whether they’re commuting to work or college, parking up for a day trip, or charging their electric car.

Our plan for drivers will support thousands of skilled jobs and help grow the economy, sitting alongside our continued record investment in public transport and active travel – ensuring people have the freedom to travel how they want.

To help ease congestion, £70 million will be provided to councils this financial year in 3 different schemes to invest in improving traffic lights and signals, includingAItech to optimise traffic flow in city centres.

Journeys will also be smoother and quicker with the digitisation of traffic regulation orders, which will pave the way for autonomous vehicles and make life easier for today’s motorists by ensuring satnavs have the most up-to-date information on the location of parking spaces, road closures and speed limits.

These measures fulfil the government’s commitment to support families and grow the economy by making driving easier for the 50 million car licence holders in theUK. It will also help people make the switch to electric vehicles as the country continues its proportionate, balanced journey to net zero.

The measures come on top of extending the temporary fuel duty cut for another year in March 2023 to save drivers a total of around £5 billion over the past 2 years.

Hydrogen, which produces no carbon emissions when used as a fuel, has an abundance of potential yet to be unlocked. The Hydrogen Transport Hub competition will encourage growth in this vital sector.

As part of the competition, run by Innovate UK, businesses and research groups will collaborate to discover how hydrogen can be used as a reliable fuel source. From lowering carbon emissions on grocery deliveries to making the air in cities cleaner, today’s investment opens up the possibilities of hydrogen to revolutionise how people live and breathe across the country.

The competition will address challenges such as refuelling on a large scale, ensuring buses and coaches can use hydrogen in public transport ecosystems and how to make the supply chain greener with hydrogen-fuelledHGVs.

As the technologies develop, the research from this competition will help bring about the large-scale production of low-carbon hydrogen, which could also reduce the nation’s reliance on imported fossil fuels.

Today’s announcement (6 October 2022) will also see an additional £300,000 put forward to support upskilling the local workforce and foster a specialised skills base and pipeline of talent, further cementing Tees Valley’s status as the home of hydrogen. This will help grow the UK economy with a transport system that is resilient to global energy prices, environmentally friendly and could see the creation of hundreds of skilled jobs.

Transport Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said:

Climate change is one of the biggest challenges this generation faces, and with transport contributing 24% to the UK’s CO2 levels, we are working hard to change things now and for the future.

Tees Valley continues to be the beacon for hydrogen technologies and will be further supported by £20 million going to the best and the brightest ideas that will create a world-leading industry with more skilled jobs in the heart of the north of England.

Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said:

With ever-increasing global energy prices, a looming net zero deadline but a real chance to grab the emerging opportunity with both hands, now more than ever, we must be looking to the cleaner, safer and healthier industries of the future, such as hydrogen.

The first phase of our Hydrogen Transport Hub pilot, at sites including Teesside Airport, has already proved a great success, showing how these vehicles can be used safely, effectively and cleanly in a whole range of ways.

Now, thanks to this competition, our brilliant innovative businesses can go further to unlock the potential of hydrogen to transform our transport system and undertake vital research that – alongside plans by BP, Kellas Midstream, Northern Gas Networks and others – will cement our area as a hydrogen powerhouse.

With this new funding, the Hydrogen Transport Hub, a testing ground of hydrogen-focused businesses and expertise, will see its largest competition launch.

The previous competition earlier this year saw over £2.6 million awarded to various winners to develop 21 vehicles. That included Toyota, which provided hydrogen vehicles for local police forces and HVS trucks which developed a hydrogen-powered van for large supermarkets to deliver largescale groceries, to offer a solution for when batteries cannot. Setting a good foundation, these examples are just the touchpaper to set alight the imagination of British businesses when building a greener economy, helping consumers seamlessly transition to a lower carbon lifestyle.

As a result, the UK is one step closer to solving one of the biggest challenges to reaching net zero in seeing larger vehicles utilising hydrogen across the transport network beyond battery power, with the winning bids aiming to display their final products from Spring 2023.

Innovate UKCEOIndro Mukerjee said:

Hydrogen innovation will play a key part in the UK’s net zero ambitions and Innovate UK is ready to work with the most innovative businesses in this field.

We are pleased to partner with the Department for Transport and Tees Valley to help deliver a cleaner, greener future economy for the region and the UK.

Today’s funding will further bolster an area that has seen renewed private investment in the last few years with fuel companies like BP, which is due to build a large-scale hydrogen production facility in Teesside.

Born in Egypt, the son of a surgeon, Sir Magdi Yacoub qualified as a doctor in 1958 at Cairo University, specialising in heart surgery. He is currently Professor of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Imperial College. Watch his short film below.

Sir Magdi Yacoub



Magdi committed to becoming a heart surgeon after watching his aunt die of heart disease in her early twenties. He moved to Britain in 1962 determined that this was the country in which he wanted to practice. He went on to become a consultant cardiothoracic surgeon at Harefield Hospital. He was involved in Britain’s first ever heart transplant operation and performed the first UK live lobe lung transplant earning him an international reputation as a leader in his field. Sir Magdi has carried out more transplants than any other surgeon in the world.

In the film, Magdi talks about his admiration for the National Health Service, commending its egalitarian approach in striving to offer the best healthcare for everybody. He believes this approach reflects the general character of the British people.

Magdi discusses the UK’s contribution to research and remarks how as a country we’ve contributed far more in this field than our relative size. He retired from performing surgery in 2001 but continues working as a high profile consultant and ambassador for the benefits of transplant surgery. He focuses much of his time on medical research innovation, something he believes needs to be the number one priority for the future of medicine.

Under his leadership, Harefield Hospital became the leading transplant centre in the UK, reporting an increase in post operative survival rates, and a reduction in recovery periods and the financial costs of each procedure. In 1986 Sir Magdi was appointed Professor at the National Heart and Lung Institute, and was involved in the development of the techniques of heart and heart-lung transplantation.

In 1995 Sir Magdi founded the charity Chain of Hope, providing children suffering from life-threatening diseases with corrective surgery and access to treatment. He is also the founder and Director of Research at the Magdi Yacoub Research Institute in Harefield. In Egypt, Sir Magdi’s Aswan Heart Centre, which opened in 2009, treats people from all over Egypt and other Middle Eastern nations, with the less-privileged receiving free heart surgery.  The Nile-side Aswan Heart Centre is dedicated to surgery, treatment and research of the highest international standards, and also contributes to Egypt’s biomedical knowledge base, which is transmitted to research centres around the world."

We discussed ways in which we can broaden, deepen and strengthen our relationship. I look forward to working with Minister Sibal as he seeks to meet his ambitious targets of providing skills education to 500 million young people and creating 40 million new university places over the next 10 years.”

The proposed content of the programme is likely to strands of collaboration on higher education, skills, leadership and quality in education, and work to build on the existing UKIERI programmes which have helped bring more UK students to come to India. On higher education, there will be a particular focus on India’s new innovation universities, on which several of the UK’s most innovative universities have already indicated there desire to build new collaborations.

Detail of the programme will be developed through broad consultation in the coming months between the two governments, with inputs from stakeholders from educational institutions and businesses in the UK and India."

“I am deeply distressed by reports of the imminent execution of Sakineh Mohammadi-Ashtiani by stoning in Iran. Stoning is a medieval punishment that has no place in the modern world. The continued use of such a punishment in Iran demonstrates a blatant disregard for international human rights commitments which it has entered into freely, as well as the interests of its people.

I call on Iran to put an immediate stay to the execution of Ms Mohammadi-Ashtiani on the charge of adultery, and review the process by which she was tried, and her sentence. She has already faced the disgraceful punishment of ninety-nine lashes for adultery; her execution would disgust and appal the watching world.”"

It will reduce  tariffs across 97% of all goods and services and is likely to result in a stepchange in the levels of bilateral trade between the UK and Korea.  Korean companies will find it more attractive to invest in the UK in areas such as renewable energy, finance, life sciences and ICT. Korean consumers will find a wider range of British goods available in Korea, from Scotch whisky to luxury cars and high-end fashion.

Prime Minister David Cameron said:

“This landmark EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement marks a significant development in the UK’s bilateral relationship with Korea and represents a huge opportunity to increase trade between our two countries, to the benefit of business, consumers and economic growth.

“Korea has been one of Asia’s fastest growing economies in recent years but British companies have faced challenges to enter the market in the past. This Agreement, which is the most comprehensive FTA the EU has ever negotiated, dismantles those barriers and gives British business, large and small, an enormous opportunity to boost exports. I hope they will rise to the challenge.

“Having attracted some £2.25 billion of Korean investment in 2010 - more than double that of any other European country - I hope that this agreement will result in even more Korean businesses choosing the UK as a platform to grow their business. It’s essential that we get the message out that Britain is open for business.”

Business Secretary Vince Cable said:

“During my recent visit to Korea, I was very encouraged to meet many British firms who are already successfully exporting and investing in this market.

“Korea is set to make the 10th largest contribution to world growth over the next five years and will become one of the most attractive export destinations globally. British companies that are serious about growing their business internationally should seize the opportunities that have been created by the Free Trade Agreement, as there has never been a better time to engage with this market.”

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-expresses-concern-about-iaeas-latest-findings-on-iran,News story,Foreign Secretary expresses concern about IAEA's latest findings on Iran,On 15 September the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors discussed the Agency's latest report on Iran's nuclear programme.,Foreign & Commonwealth Office and The Rt Hon William Hague,17 September 2010,"The UK, France and Germany made a joint statement to the meeting, expressing concern about Iran’s continued non-compliance with its international obligations (see full statement below). The European Union also delivered a statement along similar lines. Commenting on the IAEA’s findings, Foreign Secretary, William Hague, said:

'’This report shows, yet again, that Iran is failing in its international obligations to the IAEA. It underlines that concerns about the Iranian nuclear programme are justified. Without meaningful engagement by Iran to address these issues international pressure on Iran will continue to intensify.’’

Mr Chairman,

I have the honour to make this statement on behalf of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Federal Republic of Germany and France. Our countries are naturally in full agreement with the statement made by the Presidency of the European Union.

We wish to congratulate and thank Director General Amano for his GOV/2010/46 report, which was particularly useful and comprehensive.

Mr Chairman,

Since the Director General’s previous report and its consideration by the Board of Governors last June, Iran has chosen to remain isolated, continuing activities which are in breach of international law and becoming increasingly uncooperative with the IAEA.

As highlighted by the Director General, in its Resolution 1929 (2010) of 9 June 2010, the United Nations Security Council confirmed that Iran must promptly comply with the Resolutions of the Board of Governors. This resolution therefore served to confirm and consolidate the action taken by the Board of Governors over the past several years.

We strongly regret that Iran has breached Resolution 1929 (2010) on several counts:

We once again express our concern at Iran’s possible military activities, both past and present, including studies on the development of a nuclear warhead for a missile. We note with regret Iran’s refusal to cooperate with the Agency and to grant it access to the information, sites, equipment and personnel involved in these activities. We support the Agency’s urgent requests to this end and demand that Iran comply with these requests without delay.

Mr Chairman,

Iran’s refusal to fully cooperate with the IAEA and its deliberate attempts to prevent it from carrying out its mandate in Iranian territory are just as troubling and reprehensible. We note with the utmost concern that the situation in this respect has once again worsened.

We wish to draw the Board of Governors’ attention to the seriousness of the “de-designation” measures against inspectors, about which Iran notified the IAEA on 10 June 2010. These measures are aimed at officials of the Agency who have acquired experience of Iran’s nuclear programme. The Iranian authorities are clearly attempting to intimidate the Agency so as to influence its ability to report to the Board and undermine its ability to effectively implement the safeguards regime in its territory. We fully support the Director General’s request for Iran to re-appoint the inspectors concerned.

Iran continues to refuse to ratify and re-implement the Additional Protocol which it signed with the Agency. In breach of the principles of public international law, Iran has attempted to unilaterally alter the terms of the comprehensive Safeguards Agreement reached with the IAEA, as since 2007 it has refused to meet its obligations stemming from modified Code 3.1 of the General Part of the Subsidiary Arrangements to that Agreement, which was signed in 2003. We saw this recently with the construction of the Darkhovin facility and the Fordo/Qom enrichment plant. We can still see it today with Iran’s refusal to supply the Agency with information on its decisions to build new facilities, despite the fact that these decisions were publicly announced by the highest Iranian authorities. We call on Iran to end this contemptuous attitude towards the IAEA and to once again unconditionally apply modified Code 3.1.

Mr Chairman,

The findings of the Director General’s report are alarming. Iran is pursuing enrichment and heavy water programme which have no credible peaceful purposes. To do this, it has no hesitation in breaching its international commitments, including within the framework of the IAEA. So far, Iran has rejected all offers to bring about a resolution, which remain open. The conclusion we can draw from this is that Iran remains determined to pursue a nuclear programme which could provide it with military capabilities. We call on the Board of Governors and all IAEA Member States to reject this prospect and to act steadfastly to prevent it from coming to fruition in the interests of regional and international stability and the integrity of the non-proliferation regime.

Mr Chairman,

The adoption of UNSCR 1929 reflects the international community’s grave concern about Iranian non-compliance with its obligations. Its message to Iran is that failure to address these concerns carries an increasing cost. At the same time it reaffirms the readiness of China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States, with the support of the European Union High Representative, to engage in dialogue. As the six Foreign Ministers made clear on the occasion of the adoption of the Security Council Resolution, the aim of these efforts continues to be the achievement of a diplomatic solution, which restores international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme, while respecting Iran’s legitimate right to peaceful use of nuclear energy. It is up to Iran to demonstrate its readiness seriously to engage and to address the substance of our concerns in a sincere manner. We expect Iran to respond positively to our openness towards dialogue and negotiations.

Thank you very much."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/question-time-climate-change,News story,Question Time: Climate Change,A panel led by Foreign Secretary William Hague answered questions on climate change from an international audience on 8 November.,Foreign & Commonwealth Office and The Rt Hon William Hague,8 November 2011,"TheQuestion Time: Climate Changeevent linked audiences of young people in the UK and South Africa, host of the UN COP17 Climate Summit, and was webcast live to an international audience.

The panel answered questions on a range of topics, including the UK’s policies to cut its own emissions, COP 17 in Durban and the role of governments and wider society in the international negotiations, and how young people across the world can engage in the climate debate.

Ahead of theUN COP17 Climate Summit in Durban, beginning on 28 November, an international conversation is continuing on how the world responds to the threat of climate change.

Young people will face the risks and opportunities brought by climate change, and are a vital voice in the debate. The Question Time: Climate Change event, at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London, was an opportunity to join that conversation.

Joining the Foreign Secretary were Chris Huhne, Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Ambassador Mxakato-Diseko of South Africa, and Martin Davidson, Chief Executive at the British Council. Television presenter Rick Edwards chaired the discussion and put questions from the international audience to the panel.

Foreign Secretary William Hague said:

“Climate change is perhaps the twenty-first century’s biggest foreign policy challenge. We all have a responsibility to tackle this threat and the decisions we take now will have a profound effect on future generations.

“Young people in the UK and across the world play a critical role in the climate debate, and it is essential that their opinions are heard through events such as this. As we approach Durban, we all have an important duty to show the next generation the leadership needed to build international consensus on this vital issue.”

Secretary of State for Climate Change Chris Huhne added:

“It’s hugely important young people’s voices on climate change are heard and I’m really pleased so many took part in the Question Time event. Making the shift to a low carbon economy in the UK will create new markets and exciting job opportunities for the next generation as well as providing a more sustainable future.

“We pledged we’d be the greenest government ever, so as well as the action we’re taking at home we’ll be working for further progress towards a global deal at the next international climate talks at Durban in South Africa later this month.”

Being the host of the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Britain to showcase Britain as a dynamic and contemporary destination in new growth markets such as India.

Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport Jeremy Hunt said:

“The number of visitors from India to Britain has more than doubled over the past fifteen years, and we want to do all we can to ensure this growth continues. By holding one of its largest events in Bangalore next year not only will this inspire more people to visit our shores, but it will also lead to and increase in business for all those within the UK tourism industry who are taking part.”

Ching’s television work taken her all over the UK and in the film she talks about how the overwhelmingly positive reaction to her Chinese food and cooking techniques has brought home to her how open-minded British people are she travels to the Scottish coast to meet local fishermen and introduce them to new ways of cooking their prize catch monkfish. They embrace both her ideas and her wok.

Ching believes that British food has undergone something of a revolution, incorporating influences from all over the world. Dishes available now are a far-cry from the bland school dinners she remembers when she arrived in the UK. She believes the way British people have embraced Chinese food epitomises their overall open-minded nature and adventurous spirit.

Ching moved to Britain with her family when she was ten years old. She set up her own oriental fresh food business at 21 shortly after graduating from university with a first in economics. Prompted to go into business herself after sampling a disappointing noodle salad from her local supermarket, she believed she could do much better. She started out selling healthy lunches to a handful of blue-chip companies in London and her business grew from there.

Ching found the UK was very supportive of her entrepreneurial aspirations. Her reputation spread and before long she was invited to demonstrate her Chinese Cookery skills to the nation on TV and given her own cookery series. She has become a widely recognised television personality and remains personally committed to making Chinese food more accessible."

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nasal-flu-vaccine-may-help-reduce-cases-of-group-a-strep,Press release,Nasal flu vaccine may help reduce cases of group A strep,Analysis by UKHSA suggests a nasal spray vaccine that offers protection to children against flu may also help reduce the rate of group A strep infections.,UK Health Security Agency,16 December 2022,"The live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is a nasal spray offered each season to most children aged 2 and 3 years old, and to school-aged children, to help protect against flu.

It was first rolled out in England from 2013, adding a school year each calendar year. In some pilot areas, the vaccine was given to all primary school years from 2013 onwards.

Thenew studylooked back at data from 2013 to 2017, comparing rates of group A strep (GAS) infections in pilot areas and comparing them to other areas where the vaccine was not being offered as widely.

The study found that incidence ofGASwas lower in pilot areas where theLAIVvaccine was being offered to all primary school children, compared to areas where it was being incrementally rolled out.

In 2 to 4 year olds, rates ofGASwere 73.5 per 100,000 children in pilot areas, compared to 93 per 100,000 children in non-pilot areas.

In 5 to 10 year olds, rates ofGASwere 50.3 per 100,000 children in pilot areas, compared to 57.8 per 100,000 in non-pilot areas.

There was no difference in scarlet fever or invasive group A strep (iGAS) notifications.

Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, Consultant Epidemiologist for Immunisation and Countermeasures atUKHSA, said:

Our findings suggest that the nasal spray vaccine programme, which offers very good protection against flu, may also help contribute to reductions in the rates ofGASinfections among children.

Children who catch influenza are at greater risk from subsequent infections, including group A strep, so these findings provide yet more reasons for parents of eligible children to bring them forward for the flu vaccine.

This is particularly important at this time when we are seeing unusually high rates of group A strep infection across the population.

The nasal spray flu vaccine given to school-aged children and pre-schoolers has an excellent safety record and has been given to millions of children in the UK and worldwide.

It is not too late for children to get the flu vaccine. Parents and guardians of any reception and primary school aged children who missed their vaccination should contact their local school-aged vaccination service, or ask at their school if you are unsure.

This winter the vaccine is being offered to secondary school aged children from school years 7, 8 and 9 in December and January, so if you have yet to send back your consent form it’s not too late. Parents and guardians of children aged 2 and 3 and children in a high-risk group can make an appointment through their GP surgery.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/awarding-vocational-and-technical-qualifications-this-summer,News story,Awarding vocational and technical qualifications this summer,Calculated results for qualifications used for progression to higher and further education. Arrangements for other qualifications to be issued after Easter.,Ofqual,9 April 2020,"The period since the Secretary of State for Education announced exams and assessments would be cancelled this summer to help fight the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) has been unsettling for all students and learners, including those taking vocational and technical courses.

We welcomethe direction the Education Secretary has issued to Ofqual today(9 April 2020), which sets out how the government expects vocational and technical qualifications to be assessed and awarded in the coming weeks and months.

We recognise students taking qualifications, alongside or instead of GCSEs, AS and A levels, to progress to further or higher education urgently need to know what arrangements will be put in place for them. We have worked closely with the Department for Education, awarding organisations and regulators in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland to develop our approach and are todayconfirming that these qualifications will be awarded a calculated result.

Learners due to take assessments for Functional Skills qualifications before the end of the summer will also receive a calculated result.

Sally Collier, Chief Regulator, Ofqual, said:

The wide range of young people and adults taking vocational, technical or other general qualifications to progress to further or higher education can be reassured that they will not be disadvantaged against their peers taking GCSEs or A levels – and that results will be issued fairly and in time for them to move on as planned.

The complexity of the landscape for vocational and technical qualifications means a single approach is not appropriate.

Calculated results will draw on a range of evidence, depending on the structure of the qualification. They may be based in part on teacher, trainer or tutor judgements of the result each learner would most likely have achieved had they been able to complete their assessments in summer 2020. Any centre assessment grade will be based on a range of evidence held by the school, college or training provider. Depending on the structure of the qualification, centres may be asked to provide a centre assessment grade for the whole qualification, or for uncompleted modules or units. There might be some instances where they are asked to provide a rank order of learners (as with GCSEs, AS and A levels).  Where appropriate, statistical techniques based on students’ results in previous years, on these and on their academic qualifications, will form part of the adopted approach.

The awarding organisation offering the qualification will use any centre assessment grade, combined with other relevant information (such as marks for completed assessments in some modules or units), to determine the most appropriate calculated result. Our aim is for students to receive results alongside outcomes for GCSEs, AS and A levels.

We are working with awarding organisations to finalise a list of qualifications that we will advise the Secretary of State should be in scope for learners to receive a calculated result. It will include many BTEC Nationals, Cambridge Technicals, and UAL Diplomas as well as general qualifications such as the International Baccalaureate, Cambridge Pre-U and qualifications included under the umbrella term ‘Core Maths’.

We are discussing the process for generating calculated results with awarding organisations, who will provide detailed information to their centres in the coming days and weeks.

Some qualifications are primarily designed to support progression to or through employment, rather than to further or higher education or to an apprenticeship. We are working with awarding organisations to identify qualifications in this group where it might still be possible to generate a calculated result. Where this is not possible, we will encourage awarding organisations to adapt assessments or delivery models (for example, changing invigilation requirements or moving to remote moderation) as long as this does not undermine the reliability of the result and only where assessments can take place within the current social distancing rules. In some cases, where qualifications directly signal occupational competence or function as a licence to practise, it may not be safe or meet employers’ requirements to do either of these, and there may be no option but to wait until normal assessments can take place again.

We are working closely with awarding organisations to finalise the lists of qualifications in scope for each category (the award of calculated results; adaptation of assessments; and rescheduling). We will set out after Easter further details of the approach for each category, and to outline those areas where we will need to consult.

Our overriding priority for all qualifications is to develop a process which is applied fairly and consistently, so that standards are maintained and all those who use qualifications can continue to have confidence in their value."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/funding-boost-to-get-young-people-get-into-work,Press release,Funding boost to get more young people into work,New £1000 cash support for businesses to help with the cost of providing a traineeship.,Department for Education and HM Treasury,27 January 2021,"Employers can nowapply for a £1000 cash boostto help them take on new trainees, Apprenticeships and Skills Minister, Gillian Keegan has announced today (27 January).

The new scheme will support young people to gain the skills and experience they need from the very start, helping them to get a job, an apprenticeship, or pursue further study. The cash boost – which is available until 31 July 2021 - will help businesses with the cost of providing a high-quality work placement for a trainee. This includes providing facilities, uniforms or helping with travel costs. Businesses offering new traineeship opportunities will receive the £1,000 bonus for every trainee they take on with up to a maximum of 10 trainees. Employers can claim the cash incentive for all work placements that have been completed since 1 September.

The highly successful traineeship programme has already helped nearly 120,000 young people get on the path to a great career since 2013.Recent figuresshow that 66% of trainees get a job, take up an apprenticeship or go on to further study within 6 months of completing their programme, and today’s announcement will expand the scheme even further, giving thousands more young people the opportunity to gain the skills they need to start a new career as we build back better from the pandemic. This will support this country and our businesses to fill and create more jobs, giving young people a better start while boosting productivity.

The programmes last between 6 weeks and 12 months, and focus on developing vital employability skills, alongside additional English, maths and digital skills, combined with a work placement lasting a minimum of 70 hours. Young people have completed work placements in a range of exciting industries including construction, education and health and social care.

The launch of the incentive scheme follows the announcement in July 2020 by the Chancellor, as part of hisPlan for Jobs, of an additional £111 million investment to support the largest-ever expansion of traineeships so more young people have the skills and confidence they need to get on in life.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak said:

My number one priority is to support, protect and create jobs, which is why for the first time ever we’re giving businesses £1,000 to cover the cost of trainee work experience, because we know that traineeships are a proven way to give young people the skills and opportunity, they need to be ready for work.

We also know that our young people will be vital in the national effort to recover from the pandemic, so I urge businesses to seize this opportunity and help us harness the talent of our young people and offer hope for the future.

Gillian Keegan, Minister for Apprenticeships and Skills said:

We’re pulling out all the stops to help young people get the skills and confidence they need to progress. This cash boost will help employers of all sizes provide more traineeship opportunities, to invest in their workforce so they can rebuild and grow, giving young people a vital route to start their apprenticeship journey, get their first job or go on to further study.

I strongly encourage as many employers as possible to apply now and take advantage of this fantastic offer so more young people can gain the skills they need to progress in their careers as we build back better from the pandemic.

Louise Powell, Head of Apprenticeships, Specsavers said:

We began offering Traineeships in September to provide an opportunity for young people to experience a real working environment and for our store partners to recognise the young talent available.  So far we have had 16 Trainees and 10 of those have now been offered a job with 9 about to start their Apprenticeship.  We have a further 24 vacancies and we have been amazed at the continuing quality of candidates presented by our partner Qube throughout.

Jo Morris, Owner, Bright Stars Nursery said:

Bright Stars has really benefited from having Katie on the traineeship, it has allowed us to see that she is serious and committed to working as part of the nursery before having her as an apprentice and it has shown us that she genuinely wants to be part of Bright Stars and the vision of the nursery. We have also benefited greatly from Katie’s continued enthusiasm and happy manner around the nursery, she always has a smile on her face, and this has impacted on both staff, children and parents.

This new cash boost is in addition to the apprentice scheme announced last year, which offers employers £2,000 for each new apprentice they hire aged under 25, and £1,500 for apprentice aged 25 and over. This includes taking on an apprentice who has been made redundant. More than ten thousand employers have already taken up the offer, which is available until March 2021, so businesses can create even more opportunities and give more people the life changing chance to start a great career.

The government’s£2 billion Kickstart Schemeis also creating hundreds of thousands of new, fully subsidised jobs for young people across the country.

Together, these schemes will ensure that more of our young people are given the opportunities they deserve, helping them to secure the experience and skills that they need to get a job or start further education or training, while boosting productivity and filling more jobs."

The events have been carefully selected to represent a range of sports and indoor and outdoor spectator environments. They are expected to include two men’s county cricket friendly matches – such as Surrey v Middlesex at The Oval on 26-27 July – the World Snooker Championship at Sheffield’s Crucible Theatre from 31 July, and the Glorious Goodwood horse racing festival on 1 August. There are also likely to be further pilot events for other sports, in order to build up to and prepare for the full, socially distanced return of sporting events from 1 October 2020.

The pilot events will provide the opportunity to stress-test the Government’s ‘stage five’ guidance, on the return of fans to elite sports events.

The guidance has been developed with UK Sport and in close consultation with the Deputy Chief Medical Officers of England, Public Health England, the Sports Grounds Safety Authority, Police and medical representatives across Olympic, Paralympic and professional sports governing bodies.

It is designed for competition delivery partners and venue operators and marks the final piece of Government guidance for the resumption of elite sport. The guidance will outline the conditions, facilities and processes that will need to be implemented for the safe return of spectators to competitive sporting events, including tight restrictions on numbers in the short-term.

Further guidance outlining the licensing obligations for sports stadia and how venue operators must calculate safe capacities in line with social distancing restrictions will be published by the Sports Grounds Safety Authority..

It marks the latest phase of the Government’s measured approach around the return of elite sport, under carefully controlled conditions.

Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston said:

For months millions of us have felt the void of being unable to go to the match to support our team or attend a top-class sporting event. So I am pleased that we are now able to move forward with a plan to help  venues safely reopen their doors to fans.

I recognise that not every sport, team or club has the benefit of huge commercial revenue, and it is often their dedicated fans that are the lifeblood which helps keep them going. By working closely with sports and medical experts, these pilots will help ensure the safe return of fans to stadia.

Although it will remain some time before venues are full to capacity, this is a major step in the right direction for the resumption of live spectator sport across the country.

The stage five guidance makes clear that the following operating standards must be in place for spectators until further notice:

Sports venues have been closed to spectators since lockdown measures were implemented on 23 March 2020. However in recent weeks certain elite sports have resumed behind closed doors, such as Premier League and Championship football, international cricket and horse racing.

This latest announcement is part of the Government’s carefully-designed package to ease the burdens of lockdown in a way that is expected to keep the R rate, the average number of secondary infections produced by 1 infected person, down. The phased approach is outlined in the Prime Minister’s roadmap for easing lockdown.

ENDS

Notes to editors:

The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has published a range of guidance in relation to elite sport over recent weeks.

On 13 May ‘stage one’ guidance was published, outlining conditions for a return to individual performance training at official elite training venues while maintaining social distancing from teammates and other people outside their households. This included safeguards such as the deep cleaning of facilities and the screening of athletes and staff for coronavirus symptoms before they can enter the training venue by an appropriately trained healthcare professional.

On 25 May, DCMS published ‘stage two’ guidance, outlining the conditions for elite athletes to resume competitive, close contact training at official elite training venues, so that players could get match fit under carefully controlled medical conditions.

On 30 May, DCMS published ‘stage three’ guidance - the conditions for elite athletes and professional sportsmen and women to resume competitive sport behind closed doors safely in England from 1 June. This opened the door for the first domestic live action in almost three months.

On 5 July the Culture Secretary announced he had brokered agreements with sports authorities and event organisers to allow a limited number of international sporting events to be exempt from border health measures and get underway this summer, with strong public health protections in place. This was followed bystage fourguidance, which outlines the conditions, facilities and processes that will need to be implemented for all cross-border sporting competition to take place behind closed doors, being published on 7 July.

Further updates to the stage five guidance may be published to reflect the result of the test events before competition with spectators is permitted. Competition Delivery Partners (the Competition Organiser and the Competition Venue Operator) should periodically check gov.uk for further updates.

Sport is a devolved matter and this guidance is applicable to elite sports in England. Those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland should refer to guidance from the devolved administrations."

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/most-people-believe-inequality-has-increased-due-to-the-pandemic,Press release,Most people believe inequality has increased due to the pandemic,A new poll by the Social Mobility Commission reveals a growing gulf between social classes and a mental health crisis that needs to be addressed.,Social Mobility Commission,11 March 2021,"Nearly 6 in 10 people believe the pandemic has increased the gulf between social classes, according to a new poll from the Social Mobility Commission.

The Social Mobility Barometer, 2021, unveils deep concern that social division in Britain has increased as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. Four in five adults (79%) now believe there is a large gap between different social classes and over half the public (56%) think the pandemic has increased social inequality.

A third (33%) say that inequality has increased by a lot, and 23% by a little, according to the survey of 4,693 adults in the UK, carried out by YouGov.

The findings coincide with growing evidence that those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds are being most affected by the pandemic. Young people from the poorest backgrounds are losing their jobs, while families are trapped in cramped housing, sometimes unable to afford basic necessities. Children from disadvantaged families, often without digital access, are falling behind at school.

Our annual Barometer also shows significant public concern about mental health. 55% of UK adults think the pandemic has had the most impact on mental health, while 44% say difficulties caused by a lack of social contact. 26% believe employment opportunities have been most affected with 22% citing access to education.

When asked, however, what the government’s key priorities should be in any pandemic recovery plan, the largest number of respondents said employment opportunities (47%) followed by addressing mental health issues (46%) and improving access to education (33%).

In general, two-thirds (64%) of the public believe those who are ‘just about managing’ are not getting enough support from the government. Similarly, more than half (52%) the public think those who are the least well off are not getting enough government support.

Steven Cooper, interim Co-Chair of the Social Mobility Commission, says:

The pandemic has had a devastating impact on jobs, training and mental health, particularly among the most disadvantaged groups. This poll dramatically underlines public concern about growing social inequality. Government, employers and educators should listen and act. The most disadvantaged – at home, school or work – should now be put centre stage in any recovery plan.

Regional differences are also laid bare. Overall 74% of people think there are large differences in opportunities across Britain. Within England there is still a stark north/south divide in terms of how people feel about their prospects. Only 31% of people in the north-east believe opportunities to progress in their area are ‘good’, compared to 74% in London.

The poll comes just before the Social Mobility Commission moves to the Cabinet Office. This arm’s length body hopes to use its new location to inform the government’s levelling up agenda to create a more equal society, particularly in the regions. This year the Commission is planning to work with central government, local leaders and metro mayors to share best practice and encourage more targeted action in the “coldest spots” across England.

Owen Paterson said:

This Budget will help us deliver a strong and stable economy, promoting growth and supporting enterprise.

The Exchequer Secretary, David Gauke, will be in Northern Ireland tomorrow and together with Northern Ireland party leaders we will be publishing measures to help rebalance the economy. This is the start of a process which could lead to increased investment and make Northern Ireland one of the best places in Europe to do business.

The Secretary of State went on to say:

This Budget and the Plan for Growth will help business and individuals alike, it will take 9,000 in Northern Ireland out of tax altogether and reduces tax for 640,000 others.

The Plan for Growth is particularly exciting. It contains a wide range of measures that will last for the remainder of the Parliament. We are going to:

I also welcome the reduction in fuel duty and the introduction of the fair fuel stabiliser which I know will be welcomed by drivers across the province. The freeze in Air Passenger Duty and the consultation on its replacement will be welcomed by those of us who rely on air travel which is essential for developing our business and tourist industry.

Where these matters are devolved in Northern Ireland we shall work in partnership with Northern Ireland ministerial colleagues to take forward implementation of the Plan for Growth.

This is a Budget for growth across the whole United Kingdom in which Northern Ireland will share. Working together with the Executive we are committed to rebalancing the economy away from unsustainable public sector spending based on debt towards sustainable, private sector led growth to the benefit of all the people of Northern Ireland."

450 student leaders, journalists and academics to be taken to Auschwitz over the next 3 years and expected to educate tens of thousands of students on their return

Communities Secretary also demands all universities and Local Authorities adopt theIHRAdefinition of antisemitism

Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has announced £500,000 of new funding for a programme supporting universities in tackling antisemitism on campus over 3 years.

Announced on the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, the money will support the Holocaust Education Trust (HET) to help educate the next generation about the horrors of the holocaust and the importance of stamping out antisemitism and intolerance.

Each year, 150 university student leaders, student journalists and academics from around the country will hear from Holocaust survivors and visit the former Nazi concentration camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where they will learn about the importance of stamping out antisemitism.

Upon their return, students will participate in a seminar which will deal explicitly with campus-specific issues and how to identify and tackle antisemitism.

To drive engagement amongst the student population, the programme will work with influential student publications and media, as well as student leaders and networks to disseminate the messages they have heard first hand to tens of thousands of students across the country.

The Communities Secretary has also insisted that all universities and Local Authorities must adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism.

He has written to all local authorities asking them to adopt the internationally-recognised definition and will shortly publish a list of those who have taken this forward and urged others to follow.

Communities Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:

As we mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, it is our duty to ensure that as the last survivors remain with us, their stories are shared with future generations.

Education is one of the most powerful tools we can use to combat antisemitism. I am proud this government will fund the Holocaust Educational Trust to educate thousands of students and academics in the horrors of the Holocaust.

This additional £500,000 of funding will allow hundreds of university students and academics each year to visit Auschwitz-Birkenau, hear from the last Holocaust survivors and, on return to their campuses, help educate students on the importance of tackling antisemitism.

I have also been clear that all universities and local councils that have not already done so, must adopt theIHRAdefinition of antisemitism. I will shortly publish a list of councils who have adopted the definition and will urge others to follow.

The student programme will be delivered by the Holocaust Educational Trust in partnership with the Union of Jewish Students. It follows the highly successful 2018-19 scheme which identified 30 universities in England where there had been reports of high levels of antisemitism or racism.

Funded by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG), the next phase will be a chance for a greater number of universities to get involved and builds on fromHET’s highly successful ‘Lessons from Auschwitz’ programme for school students.

Chief Executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust Karen Pollock MBE said:

As we mark 75 years since the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, we are reminded today of the importance of speaking out against antisemitism, wherever it is found.

Student leaders themselves are at the coalface on campus combatting the antisemitism that blights many students’ university experience. We are proud therefore that thanks to new government funding we will be able to offer a unique opportunity for student leaders and Vice-Chancellors for the next three years to visit Auschwitz.

They will see for themselves the site where 1.1 million people were murdered, to understand where hate can ultimately lead and I hope this experience will empower them to stand up to prejudice, hatred and division on campus and in broader society.

We are proud to partner with the Union of Jewish Students to deliver this important project.

Daniel Kosky, Union of Jewish Students Campaigns Organiser:

We are immensely grateful that our vitally important partnership withHETcan continue into the future with the support of the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. The 3-year commitment to taking student and university leaders to Auschwitz-Birkenau will be a vital tool in tackling antisemitism and hatred on campus.

We have sadly seen an increase of antisemitic incidents on campus, with distressing incidents of Holocaust trivialisation at student parties, the use of antisemitic stereotypes on student social media groups, and an increase in antisemitism in campus discussion around Israel.

We are determined to combat this and welcome this significant contribution to our longstanding work bringing students of all faiths and backgrounds together to create cohesive campus communities.

On Thursday 23 January the Communities Secretary attended the Fifth World Holocaust Forum at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem. He attended the event entitled, “Remembering the Holocaust: Fighting Antisemitism,” to mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz and International Holocaust Remembrance Day.

HET’s new programme will bring together 150 university staff and student leaders from across the country each year through education on the Holocaust, anti-racism work, British values and understanding of faith.

The scheme will underpin joint activity with the Union of Jewish Students to combat prejudice on campus and promote community cohesion.

The new programme will encompass all universities, targeting 450 university student leaders directly who will in turn reach a further 24,000 university students.

HET’s Lessons from Auschwitz Project for sixth form students and teachers is now in its nineteenth year.

It has taken over 41,000 students and teachers from across the UK to the Nazi concentration and death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau, as well as many MPs and other guests.

For more information see:Lessons From Auschwitz

In 2018 to 2019HETreached 125 senior leaders and student leaders.

The project identified 30 universities in England where there had been reports of high levels of antisemitism and/or racism and of these 22 institutions 73% participated.

Four delegations of National Union of Students (NUS), Student Union and student faith leaders went alongside existing LFA trips to Auschwitz, combined with orientation seminars and follow up workshops.

Participants have included two formerNUSPresidents,NUSVice Presidents for Society and Citizenship, Further Education, Welfare and Union Development; aNUSLGBT Officer; Presidents of the Students Unions at the universities of Abertay, Brunel, City (London), Coventry, Kent, Leeds Trinity, Lincoln, Nottingham, South Wales, St. Andrews, Sussex and Swansea; Education, Campaigns, and Welfare Officers from University College London, Warwick, and Trinity College Dublin.

Participants in these programmes have facilitated dozens of campus events to combat hatred and prejudice and to mark Holocaust Memorial Day. This activity has reached a further 4000 students on campuses from Exeter to Edinburgh.

The Jewish Leadership Council are working alongsideMHCLGto encourage local authorities to adopt theIHRA.

The theme of the evening was to celebrate the ‘Sons and Daughters’ of the city whose talents have earned them international reputations.  It featured renowned artists from across the cultural spectrum such as Phil Coulter, Nadine Coyle, Dana, James Nesbitt, Damian McGinty and Amanda Burton.

Speaking during the concert, Theresa Villiers said:

Derry/Londonderry has made history as UK’s first ever City of Culture.

For those who call this great place Londonderry and for those who call it Derry … they can be as one in their pride on this achievement.

The richness of this city’s cultural history does indeed merit the “Legenderry” label it has acquired as the latest addition to its list of different names … and I have experienced the warmth and hospitality of its people at first hand.

And as we go from a past in Northern Ireland that has been bitterly divided … and move together to a future that can be shared and celebrated by all … Derry/Londonderry can provide a blueprint.

And that transition is graphically illustrated by the fact that this celebration concert tonight is taking place at Ebrington Barracks … a place with such a controversial history but which is set to play a key role in what I am sure will be a highly successful City of Culture year.

Throughout its eventful past … I know that Londonderry has always retained the fortitude, optimism and vibrancy that make it such a special place.

This year can be a catalyst for Derry … a focal point for culturally led regeneration;

It has the potential to be a game-changing moment … a transformational year for the city.

Together we must ensure that this year provides a lasting legacy … both culturally and economically … for future generations.

Northern Ireland’s creative talent is among the best in the world and the UK City of Culture provides an opportunity to showcase this internationally.

So it is with great pleasure that I look forward to experiencing Londonderry’s home grown musical talent tonight, a talent that has put Derry on the international stage for all the right reasons."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/natural-solutions-for-tackling-health-inequalities-conference-report,News story,Natural solutions for tackling health inequalities: conference report,"The Institute of Health Equity (IHE) has published a report funded by Natural England, which highlights the growing evidence of the benefits of green spaces on health and wellbeing, and the differences in access to natural environments across England, which contribute to health inequalities.",Natural England,7 October 2014,"Thereporthas been published following last year’s ‘Natural solutions to tackling health inequalities’ conference, hosted by the nationaloutdoors for all working group. The conference attracted practitioners, academics and policy makers from over 70 organisations involved in health, diversity and environment at local and national levels.

The conference looked at evidence of the benefits of the natural environment to our health and, in particular, to those communities with the greatest need. It made some recommendations to improve inequalities that exist.

The report includes evidence that shows:

Duncan Selbie CEO of Public Health England, in his foreword to the report makes the point that: “Recognising the role of the natural environment as a primary determinant of health is, in many ways, the foundation of modern public health. Good health and wellbeing is not solely the absence of illness; the role of the environment we live in is hugely important in shaping our lives and, consequently, our health. So this report is a timely and very welcome contribution to increasing awareness of this amongst practitioners and policy makers, both in the health and environment sectors.”

Duncan concludes by saying: “So having access to high quality, local natural environments is critically important to promoting physical health and wellbeing in children and adults. Together, through this report, we have the opportunity to look afresh at what have hitherto appeared to be intractable public health challenges, and share our knowledge and experience of what works so that we can make a real difference to the quality of people’s lives.”

Dr Jessica Allen, Deputy Director at theIHE, University College London and lead author for the report, in summarising the evidence states: “Overall, better health is related to access to green space regardless of socio-economic status, and income-related inequality in health is moderated by exposure to green space. So, increasing the amount and quality of green space can be part of a low cost package to address health inequalities, improve health outcomes and deliver other benefits.”

Natural England’sMonitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE)survey also reveals that some social groups visit the natural environment far less frequently than the rest of the population. It is these groups that often suffer the greatest health inequality, and it is these groups that could benefit the most from increased access to the natural environment. Together these communities are a very significant proportion of the English population and their numbers are growing:

National outdoors for all working group members are now actively working with the health and environment sectors to help implement the report’s recommendations."

Eleven UK gas hob manufacturers have now committed to undertake a corrective action programme to make certain hobs safe, as a result of an investigation by the Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS).

The companies involved are Apelson Appliances UK Ltd, Buy It Direct Ltd, Glen Dimplex Home Appliances, Kingfisher International Products Ltd, Lancaster Holdings Ltd, Maurice Lay Distributors Ltd, Midea UK Ltd, Product Care Trading Ltd, Shop Direct Home Shopping Ltd, Stax Trade Centres Ltd and The Wright Buy Ltd.

This followed a number of incidents, including an explosion at a caravan park in April 2023, where a person suffered serious burns. The investigation by OPSS identified that faulty elbow joints used to connect certain models to the gas supply could give rise to a serious risk of poisoning, burns or gas explosion and/or fire.

The companies will visit every home containing affected hobs and make them safe. Information about the brands and models are available via the companies’ websites.

OPSS is urging all affected members of the public, including those unsure whether they are impacted or not, to check the model links and contact the manufacturer:

Read the Important Safety Message – Gas Hob Elbow Joints Corrective Action Programme.

OPSS issued Suspension Notices in July to stop further supplies of the affected models of gas hobs and updated its safety advice in August because the nature and scale of the risks involved is highest for those in mobile premises using LPG.

While all affected consumers should check the model links, owners and consumers in caravans, leisure homes and motorhomes should do this as a matter of urgency. If they are using an affected appliance with Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG), they should disconnect it from the LPG cylinder immediately.

Owners and consumers in domestic premises should continue to be vigilant. If they smell gas or are concerned that their product poses a risk, they should contact the National Gas Emergency Helpline for their area (0800 111 999 in England, Wales and Scotland, and 0800 002 001 in Northern Ireland) or a Gas Safe registered installer.

OPSS Chief Executive Graham Russell said:

Protecting people from unsafe products is always a top priority for government. The manufacturers have agreed to undertake this corrective action programme following the OPSS investigation; now we will monitor their actions to ensure they make swift progress in making these gas hobs safe for householders and holidaymakers across the UK."

I am absolutely delighted to be here this evening to mark the contribution made by George Mitchell in Northern Ireland. Senator Mitchell won admiration from across all sections of community for his skill and dedication in chairing the Northern Ireland political talks that led to the landmark 1998 Belfast Agreement.

Crucially, too, it was Senator Mitchell who in 1996 set out the principles of non-violence and democracy that were to be the fundamental basis of those negotiations.

It beggars belief that anyone would even contemplate visiting death and destruction on men, women and children. And yet that is what happened in Lurgan when 3 children were injured.

The minister urged anyone with information about those involved in the violence in Lurgan to contact the PSNI."

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/the-planning-system-is-key-to-delivering-greener-better-places,Press release,"The planning system is key to delivering greener, better places","Better partnerships and evidence are the key to deriving greater benefits from green places, Natural England will say today (25 September).",Natural England,25 September 2014,"At a conference organised in London by the Green Infrastructure Partnership, speakers from the worlds of planning, environment and local government will meet to assess the powerful international evidence about the value of green infrastructure and will discuss how this evidence can be used to influence planning decisions and so create better places.

Recent research has overwhelmingly indicated that places with high quality green infrastructure – such as public parks, green spaces, green roofs and street trees – are better for our physical and mental health, are less likely to flood, and attract more investment. Yet often the value of green infrastructure is not factored into planning decisions, the seminar will hear today.

The conference will consider how the English planning system can be used to support and maintain the delivery of green infrastructure more creatively in the long term, looking at what evidence and partnerships are needed.

Martin Moss, senior adviser on green infrastructure at Natural England who is speaking at the seminar, said: “From combating air pollution and climate change to improving people’s mental and physical health, green infrastructure provides a whole range of beneficial services.  We need a more creative approach for planning green infrastructure in the long term, making better use of partnerships and evidence, if we are to continue to benefit from these services. Today’s event is an important part of how we can achieve this.”

Challenges around health and wellbeing, economic growth, climate change adaptation and developing a resilient natural environment mean that the need for green infrastructure is increasingly being seen as an essential element of sensible infrastructure planning for our cities, towns and the wider landscape.

Julia Thrift, organiser of the Green Infrastructure Partnership and Head of Events at the Town and Country Planning Association (TCPA), said: “There is now overwhelming evidence that green infrastructure is as important to the success of our towns and cities as other infrastructure such as transport or communications. We need to communicate this evidence better in the planning system so that the people who make the decisions understand that high quality green infrastructure is a vital component of a thriving place, not a ‘nice to have’ optional extra.”

Natural England is among the partner organisations of the Green Infrastructure Partnership and today’s seminar is being hosted by theTCPAat its offices in Carlton House Terrace.  The event is kindly sponsored by LDA Design.

Others speaking at the event include Gideon Amos OBE, Chris Shipley CBE, Professor Robert Tregay (Chairman, LDA Design) and Richard Harrington (CEO, Buckingham and Thames Valley Local Enterprise Partnership).

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/boost-for-uk-science-with-unlimited-visa-offer-to-worlds-brightest-and-best,Press release,Boost for UK science with unlimited visa offer to world's brightest and best,Top scientists to be given fast-tracked entry into the UK.,"Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street, Home Office, Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, UK Visas and Immigration and UK Research and Innovation",27 January 2020,"A new, fast-track visa scheme to attract the world’s top scientists, researchers and mathematicians will open on 20 February.

This follows a commitment by the Prime Minister last summer to put science, research and innovation on the top of the government’s agenda.

The bespoke Global Talent route will have no cap on the number of people able to come to the UK, demonstrating the government’s commitment to supporting top talent.

The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, said:

The UK has a proud history of scientific discovery, but to lead the field and face the challenges of the future we need to continue to invest in talent and cutting edge research.

That is why as we leave the EU I want to send a message that the UK is open to the most talented minds in the world, and stand ready to support them to turn their ideas into reality.

The Global Talent route replaces the Tier 1 (Exceptional Talent) route and for the first time UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) will endorse applicants from the scientific and research community. The route will:

The changes are part of the initial-phase wider reforms to enable those with world class skills in science and research to come to the UK as soon as possible.

The Home Secretary, Priti Patel, said:

The UK is a world leader in science, with research and innovation that changes lives being undertaken every day in this country.

To keep the UK at the forefront of innovation, we are taking decisive action to maximise the number of individuals using the Global Talent route including world-class scientists and top researchers who can benefit from fast-tracked entry into the UK.

The reforms to the Global Talent route coincide with ambitious government investment of up to £300 million to fund experimental and imaginative mathematical sciences research by the very best global talent over the next five years.

With around £60 million funding available per year, the investment will double funding for new PhDs, as well as boost the number of maths fellowships and research projects – increasing the pool of trained mathematicians in the UK and providing more freedom for researchers to develop new ideas.

This funding will make sure the UK remains at the cutting edge of maths research, underpinning real-world technological developments, from smoother traffic flow, crime prevention, safer air travel, and smarter phone technology to the use of artificial intelligence and creating greener energy systems.

Business and Energy Secretary Andrea Leadsom said:

Leaving the EU gives us new freedom to strengthen research and build the foundations for the new industries of tomorrow.

By attracting more leading international scientists and providing major investment in mathematics, we can make the UK a global science superpower and level up our country.

The funding forms part of the government’s ambitions to considerably boost research and development spending and establish the UK as a global science superpower, changing the way people live, work and travel.

To ensure the UK is the best place in the world for research and development, the government is launching a major review of research bureaucracy and methods, including unnecessary paperwork, arduous funding applications and research selection processes. This will free up and support the best researchers to focus on groundbreaking, ambitious and meaningful research that goes on to cure diseases or improve our transport networks.

UKRI is already taking steps to reduce bureaucracy, and in the coming weeks the government will be consulting world-leading scientists, researchers, academics and industry figures on what more can be done. As part of this, UKRI will simplify the process to apply for funding, removing the unnecessary requirement to precisely forecast the long-term benefits of projects with unpredictable results.

An ambitious Place Strategy for UK research and development will also be published in the summer to ensure funding builds on strengths of the regions. In addition, this year the government will examine how the UK’s catapult centres can strengthen research and development capacity in local areas, improving productivity and contributing to greater prosperity across the UK.

UK Research and Innovation Chief Executive, Professor Sir Mark Walport, said:

Today’s announcements further underline the importance of research and innovation to the future success of the UK and the government’s continued commitment and investment.

Working with the government, UK Research and Innovation is ensuring that the UK remains a globally leading environment for research and innovation.

Our ambition is clear: to create a stronger research and innovation environment that is focused on supporting talented people and realising the full potential of their work.

Professor Julia Buckingham, President of Universities UK and Vice-Chancellor of Brunel University London, said:

We share the Prime Minister’s vision to position the UK as a magnet for global science and research talent. The Global Talent visa is a positive step towards this for UK universities. The visa route will help to ensure that universities can attract the brightest scientists and researchers to the UK with minimal barriers.

Universities are globally connected and this announcement signals that the UK remains open to talent from around the world. Our universities carry out life-changing research and our knowledge base, economy, and wider society will benefit from the international staff we can attract through this visa route.

The government continues to work closely with the scientific community in developing its proposals and to ensure the UK immigration system attracts the sharpest minds and scientific talent.

The Immigration Rules to bring the visa changes into effect will be made on the 30 January 2020 and come into effect on the 20 February."

This was a cruel and evil act.

He served the community that the people who murdered him want to destroy.

There can be no more marked contrast than that.

The people in all parts of Ireland and beyond want peace and those who carried out this atrocity are in the grip of an obscene delusion if they think that by murder they can defy their will.

Speaking after attending the funeral of PSNI Constable Ronan Kerr, Mr Paterson said:

Today was a deeply sad and moving occasion, but it was also uplifting.

So many people from across Northern Ireland and beyond came together not just to show support for Ronan’s family but as a physical manifestation of the heart felt desire for a complete and final end to violence.

Cardinal Brady’s words were immensely powerful when he said: “Unfortunately there are some people who do not believe that Ronan should have joined the PSNI.

“They have a right to hold that view, but the freedom to hold that view also brings with it a great responsibility. It brings the duty to respect the will of the overwhelming majority of the people. And the people have said no, never again, to the evil and futility of violence.

“They have said an empathetic no to the murder and mayhem of the past. Let there be no doubt that the killing of Ronan Kerr, was totally unjustified. It was an evil deed, an offence against God and a complete rejection of the belief that human life is sacred.

“Of course there is now a whole generation of young people who have no memory of the troubles and the sufferings of the past. We should resist the temptation to glamorise the dreadful pain and sorrow of that past.

“Parents and grandparents, I beg you, plead with your children and with your grandchildren, not to get involved with violence. Never let them be deceived by those who say that Ireland will be united or the Union made more secure by war. They are wrong. It is an illusion. Violence has nothing, absolutely nothing, to offer except misery and destruction. Choose life, I say, choose goodness, choose peace. That is what God is asking of you. That is what the people of all traditions have been saying to all of us, loud and clear, since the moment of Ronan’s tragic death on Saturday last. We do not want this. You do not act in our name. In God’s name stop - and stop now!"

This is a very timely and significant report by the Centre for Social Justice. It highlights that in tackling poverty Northern Ireland has much to learn from Great Britain, but Great Britain can also learn much from the excellent work being done in Northern Ireland. I have seen a great deal of this at first hand in opposition and now in government.

The report also reinforces the need to move politics forward in Northern Ireland to focus on the mainstream issues that affect people in their daily lives. Many of the areas covered by the report are rightly devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly. I trust that local politicians will find the report’s conclusions a positive contribution to promoting social justice and a shared future for all the people of Northern Ireland. As I have said many times, this is a team effort between the UK government, the devolved administration and those organisations that are key to delivering these objectives on the ground."

“Consumers should be able to help themselves, provided they have the right help and information to do so. We want to do more to promote these options as well as continue to regulate as a last resort where necessary to provide a safety net for the most vulnerable.”

I am sure that the whole House will join me in condemning this cowardly and evil crime which took place in Northern Ireland yesterday.

And I am sure they will also wish to join me in sending our deepest condolences to Mr Black’s family with regard to the devastating loss which they have suffered.

In brief … the facts are as follows:

At around 7.40am yesterday, a car was found on the Belfast bound carriageway of the M1 between Portadown and Lurgan.

There were a number of bullet holes in the car and the driver was dead.

He was later identified as Mr David Black … a 52 year old officer with the Northern Ireland Prison Service.

Mr Black was travelling to work at HMP Maghaberry …. Northern Ireland ‘s top security prison.

He leaves a widow … Yvonne … and a son and daughter, Kyle and Kyra.

Our profound sympathies must go to all of his family and friends at this very difficult time.

Mr Black had served as a prison officer for over 30 years. Like all his colleagues in the prison service … his dedication to duty and to public service played a vital part in efforts to keep people in Northern Ireland safe from harm.

As the First and deputy First Ministers put it in their joint statement yesterday, an attack on the prison service “is an attack on all of us.”

Condemnation of this despicable murder has come from across the community in Northern Ireland … as it has from the rest of the UK … from the Republic of Ireland … and from the United States .

The Police Service of Northern Ireland have embarked on a meticulous investigation of the crime.

The House will appreciate that this inquiry is at an early stage so the information I can give today is limited.

I would, though, repeat the appeal that was made yesterday that anyone

who has any information on this tragedy to come forward and contact the police.

From my discussions with the Chief Constable … I know that he and his officers will not rest until the perpetrators have been brought to justice and put behind bars where they belong.

This attack has demonstrated the gravity of the threat that dissident terrorist groups still pose.

That is reflected in the threat level in Northern Ireland which remains at Severe meaning an attack is highly likely.

The numbers involved in terrorist activities are small but these groupings have capability and they have lethal intent.

They can still ruin lives despite their lack of support.

So we remain vigilant.

I pay tribute to the PSNI and the Garda Siochana for their untiring efforts to combat terrorism.

Co-operation between the two police services has never been better.

That co-operation plays crucial part in protecting the public, pursuing the terrorists … and saving lives.

The government will do whatever we can to help the PSNI bring the perpetrators of this atrocity to justice.

We will continue to do everything in our power to ensure that the terrorists will not succeed.

Our overriding objective is to keep the people of Northern Ireland safe and secure.

In the government’s 2010 national security strategy … the Prime Minister made countering Northern Ireland related terrorism a tier-one priority.

And last year we provided an exceptional additional £200 million over 4 years.

But crucial as they are …. Mr Speaker …. security measures on their own they will not bring an end to this threat.

Defeating terrorists also requires the united determination of the people of Northern Ireland .

And their response to this horrific crime has been clear, united and resolute.

These terrorists act in defiance of the will of the people of Ireland … north and south … who voted in overwhelming numbers for the current political settlement.

The First Minister and deputy First Minister yesterday rightly emphasised the utter futility of this attack.

Its perpetrators may have intended it to destabilise the political situation.

From what I saw in Belfast yesterday … I believe it will do the opposite.

It will strengthen the determination of the vast majority … in all parts of the community and on both sides of the border … that there will be no return to the dark days of the past.

And nothing will frustrate the efforts being made to build on the achievements of the peace process and deliver the shared future which we all want to see. Those who seek to pursue their objectives by violence will not succeed.

The future of Northern Ireland will only ever be determined by democracy and consent.

That is the clear message coming from Northern Ireland in the wake of this tragedy … from political leaders … from church leaders … and from the wider community.

And I am sure the whole house will join me in endorsing it."

Today we opened an exhibition in Westminster Hall on the Third Home Rule Bill which was introduced one hundred years ago next month.

The emphasis for all these events has to be on historical accuracy but also respect, education and on fostering greater understanding.

And that’s what we hope the exhibition achieves.

The second event highlighting the strength of the UK-Irish relationship did of course take place today with the issuing of the Joint Statement between the Prime Minister and the Taioseach.

It sets out the framework for how our two countries can work together in a range of areas over the next decade.

Of overriding importance is of course economic growth and job creation.

Our two economies are hugely interdependent; the prosperity of one contributes greatly to the prosperity of the other.

As the Taoiseach reminded us today there’s £1 billion of trade each way between us every week.

And there will be issues on which we can make common cause in Europe, not least as strong supporters of the Single Market.

The Declaration also refers to continuing with the closest co-operation on Northern Ireland.

Let me briefly say a few words about that.

I firmly believe that the partnership between successive British and Irish

Governments, supported by Washington, has been absolutely crucial to the progress that’s been made over the past two decades…

…kick started with another Joint Declaration in 1993 by John Major and Albert Reynolds and through all the subsequent Agreements that have led us to where we are today.

As a result of all those years of effort, the political situation in Northern Ireland is now more stable than for over a generation.

We have an inclusive, functioning devolved government with all the key public services in local hands.

And there’s a broad determination across the community to make the settlement work.

The key priority now is delivery.

As the Prime Minister said in the Assembly last year, it’s time to move beyond the politics of the peace process.

For me, there are two great challenges both of which are hugely relevant to the work of co-operation Ireland.

First, the economy.

For reasons we all understand, Northern Ireland’s economy is too dependent on public spending.

According to some surveys it accounts for the equivalent of around three quarters of GDP.

That is unsustainable.

So along with the Northern Ireland Executive we are looking at ways of rebalancing the economy.

Not, I should add, by simply taking an axe to the public sector…

…but by creating the conditions in which the private sector can grow and by attracting foreign direct investment.

And let’s not forget what Northern Ireland has going for it…

…a highly educated workforce, two great universities, state of the art broadband, excellent transport connections to Great Britain and Europe, the English language, an extremely competitive cost base, strongly pro-business governments in London and Belfast.

Plus there’s a quality of life with Northern Ireland now officially recognised as the happiest place in the UK to live and work.

Of course every business in Northern Ireland benefits economic stability and low interest rates as a result of the tough decisions the Government has taken to reduce the deficit.

And they will benefit from the policies to help boost growth that we are implementing across the UK.

But given the scale of Northern Ireland’s dependence on public spending we need to do more.

That’s why we are seriously examining the possibility of giving the Northern Ireland Executive the power to set its own rate of corporation tax.

Last year we set up a ministerial working group from the Treasury, Northern Ireland Office and the Northern Ireland Executive.

It is examining the potential costs to the Northern Ireland block grant; the administrative changes that would be required; and the potential legislative vehicle for doing it.

These are all questions that require satisfactory answers before any decision is taken whether or not to proceed.

We hope to conclude our work by the summer.

Building a modern, private sector led economy is vital to Northern Ireland’s long term prosperity.

And it will help to deal with many of the deep seated social problems we face.

It will also play a key role in diminishing the pool of disaffected, very often young, people on whom paramilitaries continue to prey and from where they recruit.

Companies take decisions over expansion or where to invest for a number of different reasons, not just Corporation Tax.

But as the Chief Executive of Almac, who employs 2,000 people, is on record as saying he could double the size of his business in ten years if Northern Ireland had the same Corporation Tax rate as the Republic.

Think of the impact that could have in those hard to reach areas where Co-Operation Ireland already does such invaluable work.

The second key challenge we face is building what I call a genuinely shared future.

The Joint Statement by the Prime Minister and the Taioseach today makes specific reference to it.

For all the progress that’s been made in recent years, society in Northern Ireland is still too blighted by sectarianism and division.

The number of so-called peace walls has gone up.

Over 90 per cent of public sector housing is still segregated…

And more than 90 per cent of children are still taught separately.

Meanwhile there are 85,000 empty school places.

All of this comes at a huge social and economic cost.

According to a report by Deloitte the costs of division are a massive £1.5 billion.

So this has to be a priority.

I know that the Executive has made a start on this.

Most of the policy areas that deal with this issue rest with them.

We will support them when they have to take difficult decisions.

We recently had an extremely constructive meeting involving NIO ministers, the First and deputy First Ministers and the Tanaiste to see how we could all work more closely together on these matters.

There is much we can do together on this.

The Government realises that this is not an easy subject and given the history of division in Northern Ireland it will take time.

But as the Prime Minister has made clear…

…we cannot have a situation in which everything is carved up on sectarian grounds.

Northern Ireland needs a shared future, not a shared out future.

Today’s Joint Statement also sets out a vision of a shared future for the UK and Ireland over the next decade.

It’s a decade that will see the centenaries of key events in the history of these islands…

…events that forced Britain and Ireland apart.

Yet today we have never been closer and the relationship has never been stronger.

I warmly welcome that.

And on behalf of the UK Government look forward to playing our part in making a reality of the Joint Statement issued today…

…for the benefit of everyone in these islands"
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-report-shows-success-of-governments-support-for-cultural-sector-during-pandemic,Press release,New report shows success of government's support for cultural sector during pandemic,"A new, independent report has revealed that the Government’s unprecedented £1.57 billion package of emergency cultural funding during the pandemic was delivered efficiently, helping support nearly 220,000 jobs and 5,000 organisations.","Department for Culture, Media and Sport, Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay and The Rt Hon Rishi Sunak MP",21 April 2023,"A new, independent report has revealed that the Government’s unprecedented £1.57 billion package of emergency cultural funding during the pandemic was delivered efficiently, helping support nearly 220,000 jobs and 5,000 organisations.

The report, from Ecorys, provides clear evidence that the Culture Recovery Fund worked, helping to safeguard important institutions, protect jobs and preserve our country’s world-class cultural offering.

It shows that the Culture Recovery Fund increased the income of supported cultural organisations by 140% during the pandemic. This helped not only to ensure their survival but to bring in audiences in new and innovative ways while organisations were closed or social distancing restrictions were in place.

It also found that, once organisations were able to reopen as normal, they often did so with a new and improved offering thanks to the support they received from the Culture Recovery Fund, which was delivered in partnership with Arts Council England, the British Film Institute, the National Lottery Heritage Fund, and Historic England.

The Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, said:

“ This report reaffirms that the Recovery Fund was money well spent. It protected our finest cultural institutions from collapse, saved countless jobs across the country and put the entire cultural sector on a stronger footing for the future.

“ As a direct result of this support, many organisations are now attracting new audiences with an improved offering, and their strengthened financial position means they are better placed to meet the challenges of tomorrow.

“ Our world-leading cultural sector is helping to drive economic growth, one of our five priorities, creating better-paid jobs and opportunity right across the country. It has a special place in our national life and I am proud that it continues to thrive under this government.”

Arts & Heritage Minister Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay said:

“ The pandemic posed an existential threat to much-loved cultural institutions right across the country, and the brilliant people who work in them showed incredible resilience in the face of those challenges. I am proud of the way the Government stood by them, taking decisive action to protect them during lockdown and to support them when restrictions eased.

“ Since the pandemic, I’ve had the pleasure of visiting many organisations which received this support – the largest ever investment in arts and culture in this country – and have been delighted to see how it has enabled theatres, museums, music venues, cinemas, galleries, heritage sites and more to bounce back and welcome people through their doors again to do the things we all love.

“ This report provides evidence of the thousands of organisations the Culture Recovery Fund saved and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it supported. Everyone can be proud of the positive impact it had.”

The Culture Recovery Fund was unveiled by the then Chancellor Rishi Sunak in July 2020 as the Government took action to support our fantastic cultural sector as it dealt with the unprecedented challenges posed by the pandemic. It protected iconic national institutions like the London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Shakespeare Company, cherished heritage sites like Moseley Road Baths, and smaller cultural organisations which play a vital and cherished role in communities across the country.

When the fund was introduced, organisations were in urgent need of support as their traditional income streams collapsed. The report found that the fund was delivered rapidly, and evolved as the pandemic progressed to meet ever-changing needs across the cultural sector.

More than 65% of funding was awarded to organisations outside London, and the report has found that the spending of supported organisations was 37% higher than it would have been in the absence of the programme, resulting in a total of £612 million of additional expenditure. This extra cash helped to keep the wider cultural ecosystem going while restrictions remained in place.

Cash reserves of supported organisations were also boosted by 188% compared to what they would have been in the absence of the Culture Recovery Fund, meaning that jobs were saved in the sector and organisations were brought back from the brink.

Since the pandemic, new challenges have emerged for the cultural sector, such as global inflation. This report also highlights how, thanks to the fund, recipients were better placed to meet these challenges head-on because of their improved financial positions.

The cultural sector creates jobs and drives economic growth through regeneration and the visitor economy, and the Culture Recovery Fund played a vital role in ensuring the sector can robustly deal with challenges in the future.

Arts Council England chief executive Darren Henley CBE said:

“ The Government’s Culture Recovery Fund was an unprecedented investment in the cultural life of our country.  Its support for cultural organisations across the country helped to preserve the vital infrastructure of our cultural economy, and put the sector in a stronger position to face the challenges of the post-pandemic world. We are extremely grateful for this support, which shows that the Government recognises the unique contribution that culture makes to our communities, economy and national life.”

Historic England chairman Sir Laurie Magnus said:

“ Historic places, heritage organisations and skilled craftspeople across the country were supported by the Government’s Culture Recovery Fund during the darkest days of the pandemic. This funding was a lifeline, helping to save much-loved visitor attractions, thousands of jobs and the specialist skills needed to keep the wheels of heritage turning. Thanks to this support, many precious historic places can continue to offer a sense of pride, wonder and connection, both now and for generations to come.”

BFI Chair Tim Richards said:

“ As an industry we’re hugely grateful for the support provided by the Government’s Culture Recovery Fund to independent cinemas during the pandemic. The funding has enabled many to continue to play their vital role within communities across the country providing jobs, a platform for diverse content and shared social experiences that are proven to be good for mental wellbeing. Despite the steady recovery we’re seeing in the sector, the wider economic climate remains exceptionally challenging to many so the need to support Britain’s world-class film culture is as important as ever.”

Chairman of National Heritage Lottery Fund Dr Simon Thurley CBE said:

“ We welcome this evaluation, which shows the massive impact of the Culture Recovery Fund in helping heritage and culture to survive. The heritage sector faced serious risks and challenges in the pandemic. We responded speedily to distribute £50 million emergency funding from National Lottery players, but the needs of the sector required significantly more funding, and the Culture Recovery Fund from DCMS was a lifeline. We were delighted to be to play a pivotal role, in partnership with Historic England, to support our precious heritage. We are proud of the speed, depth and scale of collaboration by everyone involved in mobilising support for endangered places we all love. We are pleased this report shows the positive and lasting impact of that work.”

Neil Mendoza, Commissioner for Culture and Culture Recovery Board member, said:

“ In my role as Commissioner for Culture I have travelled up and down the country, and met countless recipients of Culture Recovery Fund support. Everywhere I go, I hear the same - that without this funding, organisations would not have survived, or would not be able to meet today’s challenges with the same confidence and creativity. It is wonderful to read today how this formal evaluation confirms that the fund had a really positive impact on the culture and creativity that we cherish in our country.”

Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd (MEHL) is a military conglomerate owned by parts of the armed forces, and current and former military officers. Designating the entity under the Global Human Rights sanctions regime will also prohibit funds being made available to any subsidiaries “owned or controlled” by MEHL.

The designation is in response to evidence that MEHL contributed funds to support the country’s armed forces, known as the Tatmadaw, in their campaign on ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya in 2017, having reasonable cause to suspect that the funds would or may contribute to the serious human rights violations committed, and that MEHL is associated with the Commander in Chief and Deputy Commander in Chief.

The UK is announcing this action alongside the United States, who are also imposing sanctions on MEHL.

Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, said:

Today’s sanctions target the military’s financial interests to help drain the sources of finance for their campaigns of repression against civilians.

The UK has been at the forefront of a strong, co-ordinated international response to situation in Myanmar. In March, the UK secured a Presidential Statement at the UN Security Council condemning violence by the regime against peaceful protestors, and called for respect of Myanmar’s democratic transition and the release of all those detained arbitrarily.

This followed 2 UK-led statements by G7 Foreign Ministers(condemning the coup in Myanmarandviolence in Myanmar) and a statement at the UN Security Council in February.

These new sanctions followlast month’s designation of nine individuals from Myanmar’s military. Those sanctions focused on those directly responsible for human rights violations committed by the police and military during the coup in Myanmar, as well as the State Administration Council, which was set up following the coup to exercise the functions of state.

In conjunction with the work on sanctions, the UK has temporarily suspended all promotion of trade with Myanmar while we work with British businesses and civil society to reshape our approach to trade.

On 1 January 2021 there will be changes to UK intellectual property law to ensure the smooth departure fromEUIPsystems.

The following is a summary of the key changes.

From 1 January 2021, UK attorneys will be unable to represent clients on new applications or new proceedings at theEUIntellectual Property Office (EUIPO). UK trade mark owners will need to appoint anEEAattorney to represent them on new applications and proceedings before theEUIPO.

However, the Withdrawal Agreement (WA) ensures that UK legal representatives can continue to represent their clients before theEUIPOin cases that are ongoing at the end of the transition period.

From the end of the transition period, theIPOwill no longer provide certification for legal representatives to be added toEUIPO’s list of professional representatives. TheEUIPOwill no longer introduce representatives to the list on the basis of a UK certification.

The Intellectual Property Office (IPO) has publishedbusiness guidance, following publication of the government response to the outcome of theAddress for Service call for viewspublished earlier this year. Views were invited on removing reference to the European Economic Area.

From 1 January 2021, subject to legislative implementation, only an address for service in the UK (which for these purposes includes the Isle of Man), Gibraltar or the Channel Islands will be accepted for new applications and new requests to start contentious proceedings before theIPO.

The change will apply across all the registeredIPrights (patents, trade marks and designs).

Comparable UK trade mark and Design rights were created at the end of the transition period under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement.

On 1 January 2021, TheIPOcreated a comparable UK trade mark for every registeredEUtrade mark (EUTM). Each of these UK rights will:

You will not:

Businesses, organisations or individuals that had applications for EUTMs that were not registered at the end of the transition period had a period of nine months to apply in the UK for the same protection. In these cases, UK application fees were payable, and the application was subject to UK examination and publication requirements.

Our digital and paper forms were amended to include a new section for claiming the earlier filing date of the correspondingEUTMapplication.

Re-registered UK designs were  created at the end of the transition period under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement.

On 1 January 2021, theIPOwill created a re-registered design for every Registered Community design (RCD). Each of these rights will:

You will not:

Businesses, organisations or individuals that has applications forRCDswhich were either not registered or have deferred publication at the end of the transition period, had a period of nine months to apply in the UK for the same protection. In this case UK application fees were payable, and the application was subject to UK examination requirements

Our digital and paper forms will be amended to include a new section for claiming the earlier filing date of the correspondingRCDapplication.

For information on renewals, opt out process and numbering as well as more detail on subjects covered in this section please refer to ourbusiness guidance.

International trade marks and designs designating theEUwill continue to have protection in the UK under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement.

On 1 January 2021, the UK Intellectual Property Office created a comparable UK trade mark and  re-registered UK design for every International (EU) trade mark and design , that was  protected at the end of the transition period.

Where an international design designating theEUwas applied for, but  was not  protected, or where the publication had been deferred, the holder had a period of nine months to apply for the same right as a UK design.

A provision also exists for international (EU) trade marks.

For information on renewals, opt out process and numbering please refer to UKIPOtrade mark business guidanceanddesigns business guidance.

For further key information for customers and users ofIPabout how theIPsystem and the UK Intellectual Property Office will operate after theend of the transition period.

Unregistered community designs that arise before the end of the transition period will continue to be protected in the UK for the remainder of their three year term through continuing unregistered designs.

From 1 January 2021, a  supplementary unregistered design (SUD) will become available in UK law.

TheSUDwill provide similar protection to that conferred by the unregistered Community design, but for the UK only.

TheSUDwill be established by first disclosure in the UK or another qualifying country.
First disclosure in theEUwill not establish aSUDright. It could destroy the novelty of the design should you later seek to establish UK unregistered rights.

Business will need to consider carefully where to disclose their products to ensure they have adequate protection in their most important market.

More information is available in ourbusiness guidance.

You can apply for a European patent through us or direct to the European Patent Office (EPO) to protect your patent in more than 30 countries in Europe, using the (non-EU) European Patent Convention (EPC).

As theEPOis not anEUagency, leaving theEUdoes not affect the current European patent system. Existing European patents covering the UK are also unaffected.

European patent attorneys based in the UK continue to be able to represent applicants before theEPO. See the notice on theEPOwebsitenews storyfor further information.

SPCsare granted as national rather thanEU-wide rights.

It was not necessary for the UK and theEUto agree the creation of a comparable right to ensure continued protection of existingSPCsin the UK at the end of the transition period.

The Withdrawal Agreement ensures thatSPCapplications which are pending at the end of the transition period will be examined under the current framework.

AnySPCwhich is granted based on those applications will provide the same protection as existingSPCs.

You will continue to apply for anSPCby submitting an application to the Intellectual Property Office.

Due to regulatory changes for marketing authorisations there are some changes to theSPCapplication process which will come into effect from 1 January.

You will need to check whether your marketing authorisation is valid for the whole of the UK, or just Northern Ireland or Great Britain.

An application for anSPCmust still be filed with theIPOwithin six months of your first authorisation.

Please check thebusiness guidanceto ensure you are submitting the correct forms and accompanying documentation.

TheIPrights in goods placed on the UK market by, or with the consent of the right holder after the transition period may no longer be considered exhausted in theEEA.

This means that businesses parallel exporting theseIP-protected goods from the UK to theEEAmight need the right holder’s consent.

TheIPrights in goods placed on theEEAmarket by, or with the consent of the right holder after the transition period will continue to be considered exhausted in the UK.

This means that parallel imports into the UK from theEEAwill be unaffected.

The UK government is currently considering what the UK’s futureIPexhaustion regime should be. The government ran a consultation for 12 weeks from June to August 2021 and is now carefully considering consultation responses. Once the analysis of consultation responses is complete, the government will make a decision and choose the option which best serves the UK economy, the UK public and the UK as a whole. We are aware that many businesses and consumers are interested on this matter so when that decision is made, we will work as quickly as possible to make an announcement.

Check whether you currently export legitimate,IP-protected goods to theEEA. These could be goods branded with a trade mark that have already been placed on the UK market.

The rights holder’s permission to export those goods may not currently be required.

You may need to contact the rights holder to get permission to continue exporting these goods after 1 January 2021.

TheIPrights holder may not provide permission for theirIP-protected goods to be parallel exported to theEEA.

You may need to review your business arrangements, business model or supply chain based on the outcome of the discussion with theIPrights holder.

Businesses that ownIPrights (trade marks, patents, designs or copyright) may wish to seek legal advice if theirIP-protected goods are parallel exported from the UK to theEEA.

You will need to consider if you want to allow parallel exports of yourIP-protected goods from the UK to theEEAafter 1 January 2021.

Most UK copyright works (such as books, films and music) will still be protected in theEUand the UK. This is because of the UK’s continued participation in the international treaties on copyright.

For the same reason,EUcopyright works will continue to be protected in the UK. This applies to works made before and after 1 January 2021.

However, certain cross-border copyright arrangements that are unique toEUmember states no longer apply to the UK.

These include cross-border portability of online content services, copyright clearance for satellite broadcasts, reciprocal protection for database rights and the orphan works exception.

The effect of this change on UK copyright works and related services may vary and will depend on domestic legislation in eachEUstate as well as private contractual relationships.

More information is available in ourbusiness guidance.

A geographical indication is anIPright used on products that have a specific geographical origin. They possess qualities or a reputation due to that origin, such as Scotch Whisky or Stilton cheese.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) leads on agricultural and food Geographical Indications (GIs) in the UK. They havepublished guidance, including on the new UKGIschemes which will come into force on 1 January 2021.

TheIPOhas worked withDefrato ensure the new schemes are compatible with the widerIPframework. This will ensure the existing relationship between trade marks andGIsis maintained.  More information is available in ourbusiness guidance.

The way in which businesses protect theirIPrights at the UK border will change once the Transition Period ends on 31 December 2020. From this date all UK protection within theEUwill cease to be recognised.

Thefunding package announced today(1 March 2022) builds on almost 2 years’ worth of unprecedented government support to keep bus and light rail networks running, with around £2 billion made available to over 160 operators during the pandemic.

This represents the final tranche of pandemic-related support to operators and will run for 6 months until October 2022.

Not only will this new funding support operators and authorities as they adapt to changing travel patterns – it will also help the continued delivery ofenhanced partnerships, with local authorities working closely with bus companies to draw on their operating knowledge and marketing skills.

Additionally, it will support local authorities and operators across England as they continue working onbus service improvement plansand delivering substantive improvements to local services.

This additional package will help millions of passengers get around as they return to the network.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said:

The funding I’ve announced today will ensure millions of us can continue to use vital public transport services and brings the total we’ve provided to the sector to keep services running throughout the pandemic to over £2 billion.

Not only that – as we look ahead and continue our work to overhaul services and build back better from the pandemic, this funding will also help authorities and operators work together to provide even better services for people right across the country.

The government is investing over £3 billion in bus services by 2025, including £1.2 billion to improve fares, services and infrastructure, and a further £525 million for zero emission buses.

Roads minister Baroness Vere said:

Millions of people rely on buses and trams to get them to work, school and the shops, which is why we have already provided billions of pounds of support for the sector throughout the pandemic.

This latest funding builds on that support and will help keep services running as we emerge from COVID-19 and ensure networks meet passenger demand.

Graham Vidler, Chief Executive of the Confederation of Passenger Transport (CPT), said:

This welcome funding will help operators have the certainty they need to run an extensive network of services over the coming months as we all adjust to life after the pandemic.

In the longer term, the bus network will need to adapt to meet passengers’ new travel patterns. Over the coming months, operators will be working closely with local authorities to plan future bus networks and introduce plans to grow passenger numbers. To aid these local efforts we look forward to working with the government to loudly promote bus travel.

This funding is dependent on local areas and operators co-designing a financially sustainable and passenger-focused public transport network, that works for changing travel patterns post-pandemic.

More details on the allocation of this funding will be provided in due course.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ukhsa-and-ons-release-estimates-of-excess-deaths-during-summer-of-2022,Press release,UKHSA and ONS release estimates of excess deaths during summer of 2022,A joint report by UKHSA and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows the effect of this summer’s record temperatures on excess mortality.,UK Health Security Agency,7 October 2022,"Initial analysisby the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) shows that across the 5-heat periods in the summer of 2022, the estimated total excess mortality (excluding coronavirus (COVID-19)) in England was 2,803 for those aged 65 and over. This is the highest excess mortality figure during heat-periods observed since the introduction of the Heatwave plan for England in 2004.

In July, some places in England recorded temperatures of over 40 degrees Celsius for the first time in recorded history andUKHSAissued its first ever Level 4 Heat Health Alert. From 17 to 20 July, when temperatures were at their highest, there were an estimated 1,012 excess deaths in those aged over 65.

The heat-period in the summer of 2022 with the highest excess mortality overall was from 8 to 17 August, which saw an estimated 1,458 excess deaths (excluding COVID-19) in those over the age of 65.

These figures demonstrate the possible impact that hot weather can have on the elderly and how quickly such temperatures can lead to adverse health effects in at-risk groups.

Similarly,ONSanalysis from the same timeframe – June to August 2022 – for all age groups and for England and Wales, shows a recorded 3,271 deaths above the 5-year average. This represents a 6.2% increase. This is slightly higher than theUKHSAfigure as it does not exclude deaths from COVID-19, those under the age of 65 and does include data for Wales.

Isabel Oliver, Chief Scientific Officer atUKHSA, said:

These estimates show clearly that high temperatures can lead to premature death for those who are vulnerable. Higher excess deaths occurred during the hottest days this year and a warming climate means we must adapt to living safely with hotter summers in the future.

Prolonged periods of hot weather are a particular risk for elderly people, those with heart and lung conditions or people who are unable to keep themselves cool such as people with learning disabilities and Alzheimer’s disease.

Sarah Caul, Head of Mortality Analysis at theONS, said:

During the UK summer of record-breaking temperatures, there was an increase in deaths. However, these spikes around the hottest days were followed by periods of below average mortality. This is likely to be a result of short-term mortality displacement, especially among older age groups, where people died a few days or weeks earlier than expected. This trend is consistent with what we have seen in previous summers with heatwave periods.

It is also the case that despite peaks in mortality during heatwaves, the majority of days in the winter period (December to March) show a higher number of deaths than we see during summer.

This joint initiative between the government and Companies House will mean businesses can prioritise managing the impact of Coronavirus.

There are approximately 4.3 million businesses on the Companies House register, and all companies must submit their accounts and reports each year. Under normal circumstances, companies that file accounts late are issued with an automatic penalty.

As part of the agreed measures, while companies will still have to apply for the 3-month extension to be granted, those citing issues aroundCOVID-19will be automatically and immediately granted an extension. Applications can be made through a fast-tracked online system which will take just 15 minutes to complete.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma said:

We have outlined a business support package on an unprecedented scale, backing companies and their employees through these challenging times.

But it is important that our support is not limited to financial assistance. We are determined to help businesses in any way we can, so that they can focus all their efforts on dealing with the impact of Coronavirus, and this new offer of a 3 month extension for filing accounts is part of that.

Companies House Chief Executive, Louise Smyth said:

We recognise that these are uncertain times for businesses and that’s why we’re doing all we can to help.

By easing the burden, we can help businesses through this period and enable them to thrive in the future. I would encourage companies who believe they would benefit from this new flexibility to make an application in good time.

Head of Corporate Governance, Institute of Directors, Roger Barker said:

These measures will be welcomed by directors impacted byCOVID-19. Our members will be pleased to see government taking proactive steps to support them through this difficult time. By easing the administrative burden that comes with running a business, the government is supporting businesses to focus on the fundamentals during this exceptional period.

The government is also in close consultation with company representative bodies, legal practitioners and others, to look at solutions for the impactCOVID-19may have on companies’ ability to hold Annual General Meetings. Updated guidance on this matter will be published in due course."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/businesses-must-invest-in-flexible-workers-or-risk-future-talent,Press release,Businesses must invest in flexible workers or risk future talent,Research into how temporary or zero-hours contracts affect employees' career development opportunities.,UK Commission for Employment and Skills,27 February 2014,"Workers on temporary or zero-hours contracts think they are less likely to have career development opportunities than those on permanent contracts, new research has found.

The research, carried out on behalf of the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES), shows only three in five (58%) of people on temporary contracts who had received training in the past 3 months had it paid for by their employer, compared to 74% of permanent workers.

Those on flexible contracts often had to train themselves – with 17% of those on zero hour contracts paying for their own training, and 5% relying on their family to meet the cost.

The new figures support concerns raised byUKCES’s recentEmployer Skills Survey, which found that one in five vacancies is currently left unfilled because employers are unable to find recruits with the skills they need – a sharp rise from 2011.

Jeremy Anderson,UKCEScommissioner and chairman of global financial services for KPMG Europe LLP said:

Flexible contracts are an essential part of our 24/7 economy and they meet the needs of many workers. However, we need to ensure that people on them can still access opportunities to develop skills and progress in their careers, particularly young people.

We need to encourage collaboration and share best practice so that flexible contracts can work for everyone – employer and employee alike.

If flexible workers are receiving less training, and having to pay for their own, this poses a risk to the long term future talent pipeline: employers may not be able to get the skills they need and people on flexible contracts may find it harder to progress in their careers – an issue particularly concerning for young people who have taken flexible contracts as a first step into work.

The survey was instigated as part of the work being carried out byUKCES’HR Leaders Advisory Panel– which brings together leading figures in HR from companies across the country to give an employer perspective on work being carried out byUKCES.

As a result of the findings, the panel are now calling on more businesses to share best practices with each other in order to improve the way flexible contracts work for employers and employees, recognising that large employers can influence their supply chains by sharing training resources."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/oxford-university-and-phe-confirm-high-sensitivity-of-lateral-flow-tests,Press release,Oxford University and PHE confirm high-sensitivity of lateral flow tests,"Extensive clinical evaluation shows lateral flow tests are accurate and sensitive enough to be used in the community, including for asymptomatic people.",Department of Health and Social Care,11 November 2020,"Extensive clinical evaluation from Public Health England (PHE) and the University of Oxford show lateral flow tests are accurate and sensitive enough to be used in the community, including for asymptomatic people.

Lateral flow tests are rapid turnaround tests that can process COVID-19 samples on site without the need for laboratory equipment, with most generating results in under half an hour.

As part of the government’s strategy for testing the effectiveness of this new technology, these new tests are being piloted across England. This includes a 2-week whole-city pilot in Liverpool, which was launched last week.

Prior to commencing these pilots, DHSC commissioned independent research to gain further information on the specificity and sensitivity of the tests in different settings including hospitals, schools, and universities

The swabbing and processing of these tests must currently be conducted at a dedicated testing site by a trained personnel.

The devices are designed to be intuitive and require minimal training to operate, andPHEand the University of Oxford are now looking at how this test could be self-administered.

PHE’s world-leading Porton Down lab and University of Oxford undertook this work and have since been putting a number of tests through a 4-phase assessment process. This includes the test being used in Liverpool, and those that are being sent to directors of public health across the country to use for their local communities, and are also being used in schools, universities and workplace settings.

40 different lateral flow devices were put forward, of which 9 met the criteria to continue to full evaluation. Six made it to the third phase, and the Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test, the test being used in the Liverpool pilot, is nearing completion of the 4-stage process.

PHEPorton Down’s labs have shown 4 lateral flow tests to have a sensitivity of more than 70% of all PCR-positive cases but importantly catch all those with high viral loads, meaning they are effective in identifying the cases who are infectious and are most likely to transmit the disease. The fast turnaround also allows positive people to isolate quickly also reducing spread.

Health Minister Lord Bethell said:

We are absolutely committed to using the latest testing technology to make asymptomatic testing available in more areas.

It is right we’ve taken a dual-track approach to evaluating this technology – by piloting them in the field so we can understand how to best to make these tests available, and by getting our world-leading academics and clinicians to undertake rigorous evaluation of their ability to detect the virus.

I’m delighted that both are already demonstrating that lateral flow tests can be the reliable, highly sensitive technology we need to help get this virus under control, and return to as close to normality as possible.

The evaluation published today concludes that the Innova, and other tests which meetPHEand Oxford’s standards, should be used in asymptomatic, as they offer the advantage of reducing risk and increasing capacity in addition to Lighthouse and NHS labs.

Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, NHS Test and Trace, said:

These tests are proving to be accurate and reliable. And, importantly they’re able to detect COVID-19 in people without symptoms who could unknowingly be passing the virus onto others.

Our evaluation work and the ongoing pilots are helping us to understand how lateral flow tests work in the field and how we may use them to help stop the spread of the virus.

We are confident that these new tests, which have been rigorously evaluated, will make a real difference in how we protect people from this disease and help break chains of transmission.

The results of the Innova evaluation published today show:

Sensitivity means the proportion of people with a disease that have a positive test, whereas specificity means the proportion of people without the disease that have a negative test.

Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford, said:

The data in this validation report demonstrates that these inexpensive, easy-to-use tests can play a major role in our fight against COVID-19.

They identify those who are likely to spread the disease and when used systematically in mass testing could reduce transmissions by 90%.

They will be detecting disease in large numbers of people who have never previously even received a test.

Using lateral flow technology to test asymptomatic individuals will help identify those who unknowingly have the virus and enable those who test positive and their contacts to self-isolate, which can help drive down the R rate locally and save lives.

This is crucial to break the chains of transmission of the virus and to support critical industries, key workers and institutions. With lower rates of transmission, those at highest risk from the virus will be more protected and residents will feel more confident in getting back to their day-to-day lives.

Asymptomatic testing is offered in addition to the wider government testing programme offering swab tests for those with symptoms.

The government has also committed to providing the devolved authorities with access to new testing technologies as they are made available, as part of UK-wide collaboration to stop the spread of the virus. Eligibility and deployment of testing in devolved administrations will be determined by the respective administrations.

The Farming Recovery Fund was extended from 28 April to allow applications up to £35,000 for flood recovery. Updatedguidance for applicantsis now available. The fund is available to farmers affected by flooding since 1 December 2013 to help cover the costs of restoring damaged agricultural land.

The £10 million Farming Recovery Fund was announced by the Prime Minister on the 11 February as part of a comprehensive package of measures to help hard-working people in flood-hit areas following the wettest winter on record.  It will open on Friday 28 Feb to provide assistance with four key areas of recovery, offering support with uninsured losses to get farms into production again.

Under this new scheme, all farmers affected by the flooding will be able to apply for emergency funding of up to £5,000, covering up to 100% of their business costs.  This will ensure that they can continue growing crops and grazing livestock.

The majority of the Farming Recovery Fund will be reserved for farm businesses whose farms remain flooded.  Unlike the initial grant, the upper limit of this funding will be set when the impact on these longer term losses from flood damage are clearer, once the flood waters recede.

George Eustice, Farming Minster, said:

We want to help farmers affected by flooding and the severe weather to get their businesses back on track as soon as possible. The new £10 million Farming Recovery Fund has been set up to help farmers directly affected meet short term costs as the flood waters recede.

Additionally, the £10 million Farming and Forestry Improvement Scheme will offer eligible farmers grants of up to £35,000 on schemes designed to make businesses more resilient.

Designed with the NFU and local councils, the Farming Recovery Fund will be simple and easy for farmers to apply for through a single point of contact in Defra’s Rural Development Team, by emailingfrf@defra.gsi.gov.ukor calling 0300 060 2700.  Funding will open on Friday 28 February.

During today’s visit to Pristina, he held conversations with Kosovo’s President, Vjosa Osmani-Sadriu, and Prime Minister, Albin Kurti, as well as discussions with Defence Minister Armend Mehaj, and Commander of the KFOR Mission.

Kosovo is an important partner, with the UK having been the first country to recognise its independence in 2008, and UK forces have been undertaking a key role in peacekeeping and bolstering security in the region for more than two decades.

It was a pleasure to meet with the Kosovan President and Prime Minister today and to announce the UK’s further commitment to NATO’s Kosovo Force.

The extension of our commitment to KFOR underlines our unwavering commitment to supporting security in the Western Balkans region

The UK has been a key contributor to the UN-mandated NATO force since it first entered Kosovo in 1999 as a peacekeeping force to bring peace and stability following the conflict of the 1990s.

UK forces have worked to enhance KFOR’s Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance capability, significantly increasing the mission commanders’ situational awareness – ensuring the operation can provide a safe and secure environment for the entire population.

KFOR acts as one of the main security providers in Kosovo, with troops contributed by some 30 nations including Italy, Turkey, Poland and the US, as well as the UK. The UK’s contribution includes a battalion-sized high readiness Strategic Reserved Force based in the UK, ready to deploy at short notice.

The Minister also visited Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) on Monday, where he met the Minister of Defence, Zukan Helez; the Chief of Armed Forces General Senad Masovic; Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Josip Brkic; as well as the Commanders of EUFOR and NATO HQ Sarajevo.

Discussions focussed on BiH’s progress towards Euro-Atlantic alignment and on the United Kingdom’s enduring support for the country’s security and sovereignty, including through joint training, the provision of equipment and the exchange of expertise.

The Minister gave the keynote speech at the Institute for Geopolitics, Economy and Security conference in Sarajevo focusing on the UK’s partnership with BiH on defence and security matters."

All courses are online and flexible, so people can work through them at their own pace.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said:

I know how difficult the recent months have been and the huge changes the coronavirus has brought on the daily lives of us all.

The high-quality and free to access courses on offer on our new online learning platform, The Skills Toolkit, will help those whose jobs have been affected by the outbreak, and people looking to boost their skills while they are staying at home, protecting the NHS and saving lives.

I want businesses to encourage their furloughed employees to use The Skills Toolkit to improve their knowledge, build their confidence and support their mental health so they have skills they need to succeed after the coronavirus outbreak.

Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said:

The impact of Covid-19 has shown how important digital skills are - both for work and other aspects of our lives. Technology is going to play a hugely important role in our economic recovery and this new platform will help ensure everyone is able to improve their digital skills and take advantage of the opportunities ahead.

The Skills Toolkitis designed to help people gain new skills while they are staying at home and boost their confidence. The courses have been selected on the advice of experts and leading employers to make sure they meet the needs of business, not just for today but in the future. This is just a first step towards assisting with the longer-term recovery to boost employability across the country, helping people to build up the skills employers need during time spent at home.

Employers are also encouraged to useThe Skills Toolkitto help to support and develop furloughed employees who are interested in learning from home.

Matthew Fell, CBI Chief UK Policy Director said:

Online learning is a great way for people to upgrade their skills at any time, but never more so than during a lockdown.

The toolkit’s heavy emphasis on the skills that businesses need are welcome.

Maths and digital skills are highly prized by employers, so for those who take the chance to upskill they can help improve their job prospects and career progression. I’d encourage all businesses to make their staff aware of this learning opportunity.

Julian David, CEO of techUK said:

techUK is pleased to see Government taking an active role in signposting and motivating the public to take advantage of the digital skills training industry offers, techUK has long advocated for a move in this direction.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/four-generation-workplaces-on-the-rise-as-report-reveals-the-future-of-work,Press release,Four-generation workplaces on the rise as report reveals the future of work,A ground-breaking report on the future of work has highlighted the dramatic changes UK workers can expect to see in the next 2 decades.,UK Commission for Employment and Skills and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock,3 March 2014,"Some of your colleagues are old enough to be your great-grandparents, your office is entirely online and your competitors are algorithms. Welcome to the future of work in the UK.

The Future of Work, published by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES), analyses the trends and disruptions shaping the UK’s labour market. It finds that multi-generational working – so called four-generation or ‘4G’ workplaces – will become increasingly common as people delay retiring until their 70s or even 80s.

It also predicts that the role of women in the workplace will strengthen, and that an increasing divide between those at the top and bottom of the career ladder will mean that whilst highly-skilled, highly-paid professionals will push for a better work-life balance, other people will experience increasing job and income insecurity.

Technology will continue to evolve, pervading work environments everywhere, with many routine tasks becoming the domain of the smart algorithm. Multi media ‘virtual’ work presences will become the norm. As businesses seek additional flexibility, they will decrease the size of their core workforces, instead relying on networks of project-based workers.

Whilst the report makes grim reading for some, there is also good news. The demand for increasingly personalised and bespoke goods and services will lead to a boom in ‘micropreneurism’, helped by newICTdevelopments which provide greater access to markets, innovation and cost savings. Large firms will open up their business models, focussing more on the skills and knowledge they can connect to than the skills and knowledge they own. Large companies will increasingly run open R&D programmes, giving individuals and small businesses the opportunity to innovate.

As well as outlining the way employment might develop over the next 2 decades, the report also projects 4 possible scenarios for the UK’s economy, and the potential impact on work. These are:

Toby Peyton-Jones, Director of HR for Siemens in the UK and North-West Europe, and a Commissioner at UKCES, said:

Gazing into the future is a dangerous job. If some of predictions of the past had been true, we’d be living in a world with no internet, driving hover-cars and enjoying huge amounts of leisure time.

Appealing though that scenario may be, we’d be remiss if we didn’t look at the changes shaping our world at the moment and speculate about how these might influence our future. Some things are unstoppable forces – the rise of technology, for example. Other influences are subtle and fragile, yet potentially even more significant. I’d count things like the attitudes and culture of people born in the digital generation amongst these.

This is one of the most comprehensive studies of its kind and gives us an informed opinion of the way we might all live and work in the future. For example, if four-generation workplaces become commonplace, it will be the first time in human history that this has happened. What are the implications of that? Will we see inter-generational stress and culture clashes or will this prove to be a positive tension that is part of a wider diversity trend that will drive innovation?

The report comes as the role of apprenticeships in ensuring jobs and growth is highlighted in National Apprenticeship Week. Alongside the main report, there is also an onlinequiz, which helps to give people an idea of the jobs that might be available in 2030.

The report, The Future of Work, will be launched by the skills minister Matthew Hancock and the shadow skills minister Liam Byrne at an event on Monday 3 March organised by The Work Foundation.

The Future of Work was commissioned by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills and carried out by Z_Punkt The Foresight Company in conjunction with the Centre for Research in Futures and Innovation at the University of South Wales.

On 1 January 2021 there will be changes to UK intellectual property law to ensure the smooth departure fromEUIPsystems.

The following is a summary of the key changes.

From 1 January 2021, UK attorneys will be unable to represent clients on new applications or new proceedings at theEUIntellectual Property Office (EUIPO). UK trade mark owners will need to appoint anEEAattorney to represent them on new applications and proceedings before theEUIPO.

However, the Withdrawal Agreement (WA) ensures that UK legal representatives can continue to represent their clients before theEUIPOin cases that are ongoing at the end of the transition period.

From the end of the transition period, theIPOwill no longer provide certification for legal representatives to be added toEUIPO’s list of professional representatives. TheEUIPOwill no longer introduce representatives to the list on the basis of a UK certification.

The Intellectual Property Office (IPO) has publishedbusiness guidance, following publication of the government response to the outcome of theAddress for Service call for viewspublished earlier this year. Views were invited on removing reference to the European Economic Area.

From 1 January 2021, subject to legislative implementation, only an address for service in the UK (which for these purposes includes the Isle of Man), Gibraltar or the Channel Islands will be accepted for new applications and new requests to start contentious proceedings before theIPO.

The change will apply across all the registeredIPrights (patents, trade marks and designs).

Comparable UK trade mark and Design rights were created at the end of the transition period under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement.

On 1 January 2021, TheIPOcreated a comparable UK trade mark for every registeredEUtrade mark (EUTM). Each of these UK rights will:

You will not:

Businesses, organisations or individuals that had applications for EUTMs that were not registered at the end of the transition period had a period of nine months to apply in the UK for the same protection. In these cases, UK application fees were payable, and the application was subject to UK examination and publication requirements.

Our digital and paper forms were amended to include a new section for claiming the earlier filing date of the correspondingEUTMapplication.

For information on renewals, opt out process and numbering as well as more detail on subjects covered in this section please refer to our business guidance

EUtrade mark protection and comparable UK trade marks from 1 January 2021

Creation of the re-registered international design

Please see section below onGeographical Indicationsfor details on thisIPright and the relationship with trade marks.

Re-registered UK designs were  created at the end of the transition period under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement.

On 1 January 2021, theIPOwill created a re-registered design for every Registered Community design (RCD). Each of these rights will:

You will not:

Businesses, organisations or individuals that has applications forRCDswhich were either not registered or have deferred publication at the end of the transition period, had a period of nine months to apply in the UK for the same protection. In this case UK application fees were payable, and the application was subject to UK examination requirements

Our digital and paper forms will be amended to include a new section for claiming the earlier filing date of the correspondingRCDapplication.

For information on renewals, opt out process and numbering as well as more detail on subjects covered in this section please refer to ourbusiness guidance.

International trade marks and designs designating theEUwill continue to have protection in the UK under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement.

On 1 January 2021, the UK Intellectual Property Office created a comparable UK trade mark and  re-registered UK design for every International (EU) trade mark and design , that was  protected at the end of the transition period.

Where an international design designating theEUwas applied for, but  was not  protected, or where the publication had been deferred, the holder had a period of nine months to apply for the same right as a UK design.

A provision also exists for international (EU) trade marks.

For information on renewals, opt out process and numbering please refer to UKIPOtrade mark business guidanceanddesigns business guidance.

For further key information for customers and users ofIPabout how theIPsystem and the UK Intellectual Property Office will operate after theend of the transition period.

Unregistered community designs that arise before the end of the transition period will continue to be protected in the UK for the remainder of their three year term through continuing unregistered designs.

From 1 January 2021, a  supplementary unregistered design (SUD) will become available in UK law.

TheSUDwill provide similar protection to that conferred by the unregistered Community design, but for the UK only.

TheSUDwill be established by first disclosure in the UK or another qualifying country.
First disclosure in theEUwill not establish aSUDright. It could destroy the novelty of the design should you later seek to establish UK unregistered rights.

Business will need to consider carefully where to disclose their products to ensure they have adequate protection in their most important market.

More information is available in ourbusiness guidance.

You can apply for a European patent through us or direct to the European Patent Office (EPO) to protect your patent in more than 30 countries in Europe, using the (non-EU) European Patent Convention (EPC).

As theEPOis not anEUagency, leaving theEUdoes not affect the current European patent system. Existing European patents covering the UK are also unaffected.

European patent attorneys based in the UK continue to be able to represent applicants before theEPO. See the notice on theEPOwebsitenews storyfor further information.

SPCsare granted as national rather thanEU-wide rights.

It was not necessary for the UK and theEUto agree the creation of a comparable right to ensure continued protection of existingSPCsin the UK at the end of the transition period.

The Withdrawal Agreement ensures thatSPCapplications which are pending at the end of the transition period will be examined under the current framework.

AnySPCwhich is granted based on those applications will provide the same protection as existingSPCs.

You will continue to apply for anSPCby submitting an application to the Intellectual Property Office.

Due to regulatory changes for marketing authorisations there are some changes to theSPCapplication process which will come into effect from 1 January.

You will need to check whether your marketing authorisation is valid for the whole of the UK, or just Northern Ireland or Great Britain.

An application for anSPCmust still be filed with theIPOwithin six months of your first authorisation.

Please check thebusiness guidanceto ensure you are submitting the correct forms and accompanying documentation.

TheIPrights in goods placed on the UK market by, or with the consent of the right holder after the transition period may no longer be considered exhausted in theEEA.

This means that businesses parallel exporting theseIP-protected goods from the UK to theEEAmight need the right holder’s consent.

TheIPrights in goods placed on theEEAmarket by, or with the consent of the right holder after the transition period will continue to be considered exhausted in the UK.

This means that parallel imports into the UK from theEEAwill be unaffected.

The UK government is currently considering what the UK’s futureIPexhaustion regime should be. The government ran a consultation for 12 weeks from June to August 2021 and is now carefully considering consultation responses. Once the analysis of consultation responses is complete, the government will make a decision and choose the option which best serves the UK economy, the UK public and the UK as a whole. We are aware that many businesses and consumers are interested on this matter so when that decision is made, we will work as quickly as possible to make an announcement.

Check whether you currently export legitimate,IP-protected goods to theEEA. These could be goods branded with a trade mark that have already been placed on the UK market.

The rights holder’s permission to export those goods may not currently be required.

You may need to contact the rights holder to get permission to continue exporting these goods after 1 January 2021.

TheIPrights holder may not provide permission for theirIP-protected goods to be parallel exported to theEEA.

You may need to review your business arrangements, business model or supply chain based on the outcome of the discussion with theIPrights holder.

Businesses that ownIPrights (trade marks, patents, designs or copyright) may wish to seek legal advice if theirIP-protected goods are parallel exported from the UK to theEEA.

You will need to consider if you want to allow parallel exports of yourIP-protected goods from the UK to theEEAafter 1 January 2021.

More information is available in ourbusiness guidance.

Most UK copyright works (such as books, films and music) will still be protected in theEUand the UK. This is because of the UK’s continued participation in the international treaties on copyright.

For the same reason,EUcopyright works will continue to be protected in the UK. This applies to works made before and after 1 January 2021.

However, certain cross-border copyright arrangements that are unique toEUmember states no longer apply to the UK.

These include cross-border portability of online content services, copyright clearance for satellite broadcasts, reciprocal protection for database rights and the orphan works exception.

The effect of this change on UK copyright works and related services may vary and will depend on domestic legislation in eachEUstate as well as private contractual relationships.

More information is available in ourbusiness guidance.

A geographical indication is anIPright used on products that have a specific geographical origin. They possess qualities or a reputation due to that origin, such as Scotch Whisky or Stilton cheese.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) leads on agricultural and food Geographical Indications (GIs) in the UK. They havepublished guidance, including on the new UKGIschemes which will come into force on 1 January 2021.

TheIPOhas worked withDefrato ensure the new schemes are compatible with the widerIPframework. This will ensure the existing relationship between trade marks andGIsis maintained.  More information is available in ourbusiness guidance.

The way in which businesses protect theirIPrights at the UK border will change once the Transition Period ends on 31 December 2020. From this date all UK protection within theEUwill cease to be recognised.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-extends-furlough-scheme-to-end-of-june,News story,Chancellor extends furlough scheme to end of June,Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme extended by one month to reflect continuing social distancing measures.,HM Treasury,17 April 2020,"The government’s unprecedented furlough scheme that is keeping millions of people in jobs will be extended for a further month, the Chancellor confirmed today.

Following on from yesterday’s announcement to keep the social distancing measures in place, Rishi Sunak said the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) would now be open until the end of June – providing businesses with the certainty they need.

The scheme, which allows firms to furlough employees with the government paying cash grants of 80% of their wages up to a maximum of £2,500, was originally open for three months and backdated from the 1 March to the end of May.

However, the Chancellor said he would keep the scheme under review and extend it if necessary.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, said:

We’ve taken unprecedented action to support jobs and businesses through this period of uncertainty, including the UK-wide Job Retention Scheme. With the extension of the coronavirus lockdown measures yesterday, it is the right decision to extend the furlough scheme for a month to the end of June to provide clarity.

It is vital for people’s livelihoods that the UK economy gets up and running again when it is safe to do so, and I will continue to review the scheme so it is supporting our recovery.

The government has taken unprecedented action to help the economy and society bridge a period of national emergency so that as many people as possible can get back to work as the situation improves.

This week the Office for Budgetary Responsibility said the CJRS is limiting the impact on employment. Brewdog and Timpsons are among the thousands of businesses up and down the country furloughing their staff.

Future decisions on the scheme will take into account further developments on the wider measures to reduce the spread of coronavirus, as well as the responsible management of the public finances."

Check the latest information aboutgetting an MOT.

Vehicle owners will be granted a 6-month exemption fromMOTtesting, enabling them to continue to travel to work where this absolutely cannot be done from home, or shop for necessities.

All cars, vans and motorcycles which usually would require anMOTtest will be exempted from needing a test from 30 March 2020. Vehicles must be kept in a roadworthy condition, and garages will remain open for essential repair work. Drivers can be prosecuted if driving unsafe vehicles.

Readadvice on keeping a vehicle in a good condition.

People should stay at home and avoid travel. The only reasons people should leave their homes is set out in thegovernment guidance.

MOT exemption: from 30 March 2020, MOT vehicle tests will not be required for 6 months.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said:

We must ensure those on the frontline of helping the nation combat COVID-19 are able to do so.

Allowing this temporary exemption from vehicle testing will enable vital services such as deliveries to continue, frontline workers to get to work, and people to get essential food and medicine.

Safety is key, which is why garages will remain open for essential repair work.

Legislation will be introduced on 30 March 2020 and will come into immediate effect for 12 months, following a short consultation with key organisations. Drivers will still need to get their vehicle tested until the new regulations come into place, if they need to use it.

If you can’t get anMOTthat’s due because you’re in self-isolation, the Department for Transport is working with insurers and the police to ensure people will not be negatively affected as a result of things that are out of their control.

Practical driving tests and annual testing for lorries, buses and coaches have been suspended for up to 3 months."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-accelerates-border-planning-for-the-end-of-the-transition-period,News story,Government accelerates border planning for the end of the Transition Period,Border controls for EU goods imported into Great Britain will be introduced at the end of Transition Period in stages to give businesses affected by coronavirus more time to prepare.,Cabinet Office,12 June 2020,"New border controls and procedures confirmed for 2021 as the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, formally notifies the EU that the UK will neither accept nor seek any extension to the Transition Period.

From 1 January 2021 the UK will have the autonomy to introduce its own approach to goods imported to GB from the EU.

Recognising the impact of coronavirus on businesses’ ability to prepare, and following the announcement in February that the UK would implement full border controls on imports coming into GB from the EU, the UK has taken the decision to introduce the new border controls in three stages up until 1 July 2021. This flexible and pragmatic approach will give industry extra time to make necessary arrangements. The stages are:

The announcement follows this morning’s meeting of the Withdrawal Agreement Joint Committee – the last formal moment to agree an extension to the Transition Period – at which the Government confirmed the long-standing position that no such extension would be sought.

A new £50million support package will boost the capacity of the customs intermediary sector - including customs brokers, freight forwarders and express parcel operators - providing businesses with further support ahead of the new processes taking effect in July 2021. This funding will support intermediaries with recruitment, training and supplying IT equipment to help handle customs declarations. Rules will also be changed to remove barriers for intermediaries taking on new clients.

In total, the Government has now provided £84m to grow the customs intermediary sector to encompass EU trade after 2020.

Additionally, the Government has committed today to building new border facilities in GB for carrying out required checks, such as customs compliance, transit, and Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) checks, as well as providing targeted support to ports to build new infrastructure. Where there is no space at ports for new infrastructure, the Government will build new inland sites where these checks and other activities will take place. The Government is consulting with ports across the UK to agree what infrastructure is required.

Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said:

We have informed the EU today that we will not extend the Transition Period.  The moment for extension has now passed.  At the end of this year we will control our own laws and borders which is why we are able to take the sovereign decision to introduce arrangements in a way that gives businesses impacted by coronavirus time to adjust.

Today’s announcement is an important step towards getting the country ready for the end of the Transition Period, but there is still more work to be done by both government and industry to ensure we are ready to seize the opportunities of being a fully independent United Kingdom.

Elizabeth de Jong, Policy Director at the Freight Transport Association, said:

The logistics industry is extremely grateful for the measures announced by the UK government to stage the introduction of new trading arrangements between the EU and UK in the first six months after the Transition Period.  They have listened to our concerns and made allowances to enable our sector to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and plan effectively so that we can continue to trade effectively with Europe.

Richard Burnett, Chief Executive of the Road Haulage Association commented:

This is very welcome news and we are pleased the Government has taken a sensible and pragmatic approach to the problem after listening to stakeholders such as the RHA.

The Government will continue to work closely with the border industry on these new procedures as well as other sector priorities. A border operating model will be published in July 2020.

This approach is for GB/EU trade. This approach does not apply to the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and Ireland, or between Northern Ireland and GB which is covered by the Withdrawal Agreement.

Traders importing standard goods will need to prepare for basic customs requirements and will have up to six months to submit customs declarations to HMRC.

While tariffs will need to be paid on all imports from Day One, payments can be deferred until the customs declaration has been made, giving traders time to adjust to the new requirements. Safety and Security declarations will not be required for six months for all goods. Traders will, however, need to consider some other processes, such as how they will account for import VAT.

Traders moving controlled goods such as tobacco and toxic chemicals into GB will be required to complete a full customs declaration when the goods enter GB, in line with the requirements for goods moving into GB from the Rest of the World.

All traders importing live animals and high-risk plants and plant products will be required to have pre-notification and health documentation from the outset. Imports of high-risk animal by-products (ABP) will also need pre-notification. Documentary checks will be carried out remotely, and physical checks of high-risk goods will take place at destination or other authorised premises.

All products of animal origin (POAO) – for example meat, pet food, honey, milk or egg products – and all regulated plants and plant products will also require pre-notification and the relevant health documentation.

Traders moving all goods will have to make full declarations and pay tariffs at the point of importation. Full Safety and Security declarations will be introduced, while for SPS commodities there will be an increase in physical checks and the taking of samples: checks for animals, plants and their products will now take place at GB Border Control Posts.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-mental-fitness-tool-launched-to-help-military-enhance-mental-wellbeing,Press release,New mental fitness tool launched to help military enhance mental wellbeing,Today a new platform has been launched with online tools to help defence personnel to take a more proactive approach to their mental health and mental fitness.,Ministry of Defence,27 April 2020,"HeadFIT, designed specifically for the Defence community, provides 24/7 access to self-help tools that can enhance mood, drive and confidence, and help Defence people manage the stresses of everyday life.

The platform includes tools such as breathing exercises, body posture and relaxation techniques that have been designed for all defence personnel, whether they are new recruits, long-serving personnel, veterans, civilian staff or those in uniform. The techniques are designed so they can be easily integrated into their everyday lives.

HeadFIT has been developed in partnership with The Royal Foundation’s Heads Together campaign, the Ministry of Defence, Kings College London, with clinical advice from Dr Vanessa Moulton, and has been spearheaded by The Duke of Sussex.

The Duke said:

HeadFIT has been almost three years in the making, and I am extremely grateful for everyone who has been on this journey with us. Everyone who has worked on it, to create what we have today, should be incredibly proud and excited for the impact it will have.

I’ve long believed the military community should lead the way for the rest of society. For too long we have been waiting for problems to arise and then reacting to them. HeadFIT is a proactive approach to mental fitness, focusing on our own potential to increase our performance, using proven methods in sport science.

This is about optimisation of self. This is about being the best you can be. This is about gaining an advantage, whether facing an opponent or overcoming a challenging situation. This is about building resilience that will match that of most world class athletes and prepare you for every day stress. To be HeadFIT, is to be at your peak performance.

Minister for Defence People and Veterans Johnny Mercer said:

We train our armed forces to be both physically fit and mentally fit. And right now mental resilience has never been more important as our Defence community works tirelessly to support the UK’s public services during the coronavirus pandemic.

HeadFIT will provide our people - serving and civilian - with the tools they need to maintain mental fitness throughout their career and afterwards. By launching the site ahead of schedule, we are providing them with the support they deserve in these exceptional times.

Developed in partnership with Heads Together, HeadFIT has been designed with input from Defence personnel at every step.

HeadFIT’s activities help its users take a proactive approach to their own mental wellbeing reflecting the way our armed forces are trained to maintain their physical fitness. The wide range of tools on offer can be included in day-to-day routines, creating positive mental health habits.

Each of the single Services and Civil Service have programmes and initiatives to support their mental health and fitness, HeadFIT is designed to support the messages in these existing programmes.

HeadFIT is available to everyone as an open source website but Defence staff in high-security environments can often struggle to see public websites so HeadFIT has also been made accessible on Ministry of Defence technology such as Defence Connect and DefNet.

Originally scheduled to launch in June, the platform is currently under evaluation by King’s College London. The official launch has been brought forward to help Defence staff adapt to new challenges and changed working environments and the site will continue to be evaluated and adapted based on the feedback it receives.

Helen Helliwell Director Armed Forces People Policy and Defence Mental Health Champion says:

I am delighted to have worked in partnership with Heads Together on this project. HeadFit complements the single Service initiatives out there but given its accessibility the platform can also benefit the wider Defence community, including Defence civilians, veterans and family members. This absolutely plays in to our Defence People Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy and it’s aim to promote good mental health."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-national-parks-and-thousands-of-green-jobs-under-plans-to-build-back-greener,Press release,New national parks and thousands of green jobs under plans to build back greener,The new measures are part of the government's 25 Year Environment Plan.,"Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street, Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, The Rt Hon George Eustice and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson",14 November 2020,"Even more new jobs will be created and retained under new plans to kickstart a green economic recovery, the government announced today (Sunday 15 November), alongside greater protections for England’s iconic landscapes and the creation of new national parks.

Following the initial success of the first round, £40 million additional investment into the government’s Green Recovery Challenge Fund will go towards creating and retaining thousands of jobs, with funding being awarded to environmental charities and partners across England to restore the natural environment and help make progress on the UK’s ongoing work to address the twin challenges of biodiversity loss and climate change, as part of our green recovery from Covid-19.

After a competitive process, a wide range of projects to be announced shortly will receive funding to enhance our natural environment and create and support thousands of jobs. These may include action towards the creation or restoration of priority habitats, preventing or cleaning up pollution, woodland creation, peatland and wetland restoration and actions to help people connect with nature. This will in turn create and retain a range of skilled and unskilled jobs, such as ecologists, project managers, tree planters and teams to carry out nature restoration.

The government has also announced today that more of England’s beautiful and iconic landscapes will be turned into National Parks and Areas of Natural Beauty, in order to increase access to nature for communities and better protect the country’s rich wildlife and biodiversity.

10 “Landscape Recovery” projects will also be launched across England over the next four years to restore peatlands, woodlands and create wilder landscapes. These projects will help restore the equivalent of over 30,000 football pitches of wildlife rich habitat.

The commitments come ahead of the publication of the Prime Minister’s Ten Point Plan next week, which will set out his steps for a green industrial revolution to boost green jobs whilst invigorating plans to achieve net zero by 2050.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:

As we build back greener we’re taking new steps to expand and enhance our landscapes - creating and retaining thousands of green jobs in the process which will be crucial to my Ten Point Plan for delivering a green recovery.

Britain’s iconic landscapes are part of the fabric of our national identity – sustaining our communities, driving local economies and inspiring people across the ages. That’s why with the natural world under threat, it’s more important than ever that we act now to enhance our natural environment and protect our precious wildlife and biodiversity.

These measures mark the next steps in delivering on the government’s 25 Year Environment Plan commitments and itspledge to protect 30% of the UK’s land by 2030.

Combined, the new plans to safeguard the natural environment will extend protections of land by 150,000ha in England towards the government’s goal of protecting and enhancing an additional area of over 400,000ha.

Environment Secretary George Eustice said:

As we build back greener from the coronavirus pandemic, we are committed to shaping a cleaner and more resilient society to protect and restore our natural environment and diverse ecosystems.

Today’s announcement illustrates how we are leading the world in protecting the natural environment and combating climate change.

By starting the process for designating more of our beautiful and iconic landscapes as National Parks and AONBs, and through the new Landscape Recovery projects, we will help expand and protect precious wildlife habitats and, vitally, increase people’s access to our treasured landscapes.

The new Landscape Recovery projects will help expand wildlife habitats in England, restoring wilder landscapes and taking forward our ambition to establish aNature Recovery Network, which will bring together representatives from across England to drive forward the restoration of protected sites and landscapes. These projects could give a home to species that we have seen flourish in similar initiatives across the country, which include the curlew, nightingale, horseshoe bat, pine marten, red squirrel and wild orchids.

The projects will be established over the next four years through the Government’s Environmental Land Management scheme, which will be centred around support aimed at incentivising sustainable farming practices, creating habitats for nature recovery and supporting the establishment of new woodland and other ecosystem services to help tackle challenges like climate change. This follows thelandmark Agriculture Bill passing into lawthis week.

The plans will also help protect the country’s natural infrastructure by expanding a variety of habitats, such as trees, peat and grassland which are central to capturing and removing CO2 from the atmosphere, helping to improve air quality for our communities."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/plug-in-grant-for-cars-to-end-as-focus-moves-to-improving-electric-vehicle-charging,News story,Plug-in grant for cars to end as focus moves to improving electric vehicle charging,"Government to concentrate funding on expanding the public chargepoint network as well as electric taxis, vans, trucks, motorcycles and wheelchair accessible vehicles.","Department for Transport, Office for Zero Emission Vehicles and Trudy Harrison",14 June 2022,"The government is today (14 June 2022) closing the plug-in car grant scheme to new orders after successfully kickstarting the UK’s electric car revolution and supporting the sale of nearly half a million electric cars.

The scheme has succeeded in creating a mature market for ultra-low emission vehicles, helping to increase the sales of fully electric cars from less than 1,000 in 2011 to almost 100,000 in the first 5 months of 2022 alone.

Battery and hybrid electric vehicles (EVs) now make up more than half of all new cars sold and fully electric car sales have risen by 70% in the last year, now representing 1 in 6 new cars joining UK roads.

The government has always been clear the plug-in car grant was temporary and previously confirmed funding until 2022-23. Successive reductions in the size of the grant, and the number of models it covers, have had little effect on rapidly accelerating sales or on the continuously growing range of models being manufactured.

Due to this, the government is now refocusing funding towards the main barriers to theEVtransition, including public charging and supporting the purchase of other road vehicles where the switch to electric requires further development.

To continue the government’s drive towards net zero and ensure effective use of taxpayer funds, £300 million in grant funding will now be refocused towards extending plug-in grants to boost sales of plug-intaxis,motorcycles,vans and trucksandwheelchair accessible vehicles, as announced in theautumn statement.

The shift in focus will also help allow government funding to target expanding the public chargepoint network, helping to eradicate “range anxiety” and ensure the transition to zero-emission transport is easy and convenient for all drivers across the UK. The government has alreadycommitted £1.6 billion to building the UK’s public chargepoint network.

Significant savings in running costs for electric cars compared to petrol or diesel equivalents can often exceed the current £1,500 value of the grant, and electric car drivers will continue to benefit from generous incentives including zero road tax and favourable company car tax rates, which can save drivers over £2,000 a year.

All existing applications for the grant will continue to be honoured and where a car has been sold in the 2 working days before the announcement, but an application for the grant from dealerships has not yet been made, the sale will also still qualify for the grant.

Transport Minister Trudy Harrison said:

The government continues to invest record amounts in the transition toEVs, with £2.5 billion injected since 2020, and has set the most ambitious phase-out dates for new diesel and petrol sales of any major country. But government funding must always be invested where it has the highest impact if that success story is to continue.

Having successfully kickstarted the electric car market, we now want to use plug-in grants to match that success across other vehicle types, from taxis to delivery vans and everything in between, to help make the switch to zero emission travel cheaper and easier.

With billions of both government and industry investment continuing to be pumped into the UK’s electric revolution, the sale of electric vehicles is soaring.

We are continuing to lead the way in decarbonising transport, with generous government incentives still in place, while creating high-skilled jobs and cleaner air across the UK.

The government’s measures to support the uptake of electric cars over the past decade have helped to exceed electric car projections, with 39,000 newEVregistrations in March 2022 – more than in the whole of 2019. Since its inception in 2011, the government’s plug-in car grant has provided over £1.4 billion and supported the purchase of nearly half a million clean vehicles.

A newpublic evaluation reporthas been published today highlighting while the plug-in car grant was vital in building the early market for electric vehicles, it has since been having less of an effect on demand, with other existing price incentives such as company car tax, continuing to have an important impact. The report also found the plug-in van market will benefit from grant incentives more to support businesses and their fleets in making the switch.

While benefitting from significantly lower running and refuelling costs – as low as 2p per mile,EVdrivers can also expect to see a surge in cheaper, more reliable and quicker public chargepoints, as the government delivers its commitment to install 10 times more on-street chargers by 2030.

Since 2020, the government has committed £2.5 billion to plug-in vehicle grants, infrastructure and the wider transition to electric vehicles in the UK.  The industry is further boosting the switch to greener vehicles by expanding its range of more affordable zero emission cars. A total of 24 models are currently priced under £32,000, compared to just 15 a year ago, and the cost of monthly purchase and rental schemes has fallen significantly.

People should still go and get their COVID-19 vaccine when asked to do so.,Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency,14 March 2021,"Since this statement was published on 16 March, we have issued a further response. Please see our most current statement here: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-regulator-confirms-that-people-should-continue-to-receive-the-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca

The benefits of the vaccine in preventing COVID-19, with its associated risk of hospitalisation and death, far outweigh the risks of side effects. People should go and get their COVID-19 vaccine when asked to do so.

It is still the case that it has not been confirmed the reported blood clots were caused by the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca. Blood clots can occur naturally and are not uncommon.

Our role is to continually monitor safety during widespread use of a vaccine. We have in placea proactive strategyto do this. We also work closely with our public health and international partners in reviewing the effectiveness and impact of the vaccines to ensure the benefits continue to outweigh any possible side effects."

The emergency aid will feed an extra 60,000 people across the region for six months. It will also provide food vouchers for 80,000 people and animal feed and vaccinations to keep over 60,000 farmers’ livestock alive.

The Development Minister has been visiting Niger this week to see for himself how British aid is helping thousands of people survive the Sahel food crisis.

Mr O’Brien met mothers and children receiving lifesaving treatment at British-supported emergency feeding centres assisted by UNICEF, the World Food Programme and World Vision.

He also discussed with the heads of UN and other aid agencies what more the international community can do to avert a looming catastrophe before travelling to Senegal to see the impact of the food crisis there and meet heads of agencies managing the regional response.

International Development Minister Stephen O’Brien said:

What I saw in Niger was the very real human face of this terrible food crisis.

Britain will not sit back while children starve to death in the Sahel and the feeding centres I visited prove how our swift and early action is saving lives. Some very dedicated people are doing vital work to help those who are suffering through no fault of their own.

Building on the work done in the last few months and the lessons learned from previous food and nutrition crises, I am confident that our intervention is extraordinarily effective.

From what I have seen with my own eyes, the scale and urgency of the response from the British people is appropriate and means we are committing our full share.

We are delighted that other donors have also stepped up their support but there is no room for complacency.

Britain is now helping a total of more than 1.6 million people at risk of hunger across the Sahel. More than 100,000 children at risk of starvation in these countries will receive immediate lifesaving treatment.

Support includes nutritional treatment, health, water and sanitation, animal feed and vaccinations to keep farmers livestock alive and seeds and tools for families to feed themselves next year."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-intelligence-communicating-probability,News story,Defence Intelligence – communicating probability,Have you ever wondered why Defence Intelligence uses terms like “unlikely” or “realistic possibility” when we assess Russia’s war in Ukraine?,Ministry of Defence,17 February 2023,"Defence Intelligence: Probability Yardstick infographic

Defence Intelligence tweeted President Putin’s invasion plan the week before Russian forces entered Ukraine. Defence Intelligence continues to publish regular intelligence assessments on Twitter to help explain the conflict. It uses a specific language to communicate probability within these assessments.

Intelligence assessments aim to explain something that has happened (insight), or to predict what might happen next (foresight). Intelligence analysts piece together assessments from an incomplete number of jigsaw pieces. Analysts therefore use a shared vocabulary of likelihood that aids clarity for both analysts and their readers, whilst communicating the probability that explanation or prediction is correct.

A common yardstick to convey the language of uncertainty was developed by Defence Intelligence in the early 2000s, and an updated form is now in use across the UK intelligence assessment community. This ensures that government officials understand how likely it is that an event will or did occur.

The yardstick splits the probability scale into seven distinct numerical ranges. Terms are assigned to each probability range. The yardstick was informed by academic research and corresponds to the average reader’s understanding of each term. The scale is not continuous to avoid a false impression of accuracy.

Defence Intelligenceis part of Strategic Command. It provides intelligence to decision-makers in the Ministry of Defence, the armed forces, and across wider Government. This includes advice and timely intelligence assessments to guide decisions on policy, support military operations, and inform defence research and equipment programmes."

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tiering-decisions-to-be-made-through-national-command-structure,Press release,Tiering decisions to be made through national command structure,All local authorities in England to be placed in one of 3 tiers based on the latest available data.,Department of Health and Social Care,26 November 2020,"The Health Secretary will today set out in Parliament the tier which each local authority in England will fall under, in line with the measures set out in theCOVID-19 Winter Planpublished on Monday.

As announced earlier this week, the tiers have been toughened and many more areas will be placed into the higher tiers in order to safeguard the gains made during the period of national restrictions.

The first review point for the current tier allocations will take place by Wednesday 16 December.

This allows for the possibility of areas that continue to make progress in slowing the spread of the disease to be moved down a tier in advance of Christmas.

Decisions on tiers are made by ministers based on public health recommendations informed by the following factors:

case detection rate (in all age groups and, in particular, among the over 60s)

how quickly case rates are rising or falling

positivity in the general population

pressure on the NHS – including current and projected (3 to 4 weeks out) NHS capacity – including admissions, general/acute/ICU bed occupancy, staff absences

local context and exceptional circumstances such as a local but contained outbreak

If these indicators are not improving, an area may be moved up a tier and if the trajectory improves, the area may move to a lower tier.

Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said:

Thanks to the hard work and sacrifice made by people up and down the country, we are able to move out of national lockdown and into more targeted local, tiered restrictions.

I know for those of you faced with tier 3 restrictions this will be a particularly difficult time but I want to reassure you that we’ll be supporting your areas with mass community testing and extra funding.

By following the rules together we can get out of these tough measures.

The Contain Outbreak Management Fund will be extended so that it can provide monthly payments to local authorities facing higher restrictions until the end of the financial year, in recognition of the ongoing public health and outbreak management costs of tackling COVID-19. For those authorities in tier 3, this funding will amount to £4 per head of population per month, and for those in tier 2, it will amount to £2 per head of population per month.

The Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) works closely with Public Health England (PHE), the NHS and across government to monitor the number of new infections, positivity rates, and pressures on the NHS.

These factors form their public health advice to the Chief Medical Officer and ministers through the Local Action Committee and the COVID Operations Committee.

Final decisions on tiering are made by the Prime Minister at the COVID Operations Committee.

The government will also publish an analysis of the health, economic and social impacts of the tiered approach.

Local authorities that fall into tier 3 will be offered support from NHS Test and Trace and the armed forces to deliver a 6-week rapid community testing programme.

Community testing will make use of rapid lateral flow tests which give results within an hour, and will focus on locating and suppressing asymptomatic transmission. The more cases identified and self-isolating, the quicker the control of virus transmission which is essential to help areas move down a tier.

With some individuals with coronavirus showing no symptoms, increased community testing will help identify those who are infected and infectious but asymptomatic and unaware that they might be spreading the disease, so that they can isolate and protect others.

Local authorities will be able to decide whether to use lateral flow test kits for targeted testing for high-risk workplaces and industries, or for wider asymptomatic community testing, to find positive cases more quickly and break chains of transmission.

Anyone who tests positive, using either a lateral flow test or an existing swab test, must self-isolate along with their household immediately and their contacts will be traced.

Rapid community testing will expand on existing testing programmes within the NHS, care homes, universities and schools to protect those most at risk, and builds on the pilots of community testing which are taking place in Liverpool and Merthyr Tydfil.

See guidance on what is allowed in each tier.

All available data has been assessed by the government, including the Health and Social Care Secretary, NHS Test and Trace, theJBC,PHE, the Chief Medical Officer and the Cabinet Office. Data assessed includes incidence, test positivity and the growth rate of the virus.

A‘watchlist’will be published every Thursday detailing the latest data at a regional level, providing the rationale and data behind these decisions."

Speakingat an eventhosted byAmnesty International, theGender and Development NetworkandChristian Aid, Justine Greening said the Department for International Development would become more ambitious on this agenda.

International Development Secretary Justine Greening said:

The projects will help provide:

The Girls Education Challenge will be a competitive process that encourages organisations to set up schemes targeting marginalised girls of primary and lower secondary age.

Non-government organisations - including businesses and charities - are being asked to put forward ideas to get girls into good quality education and there will be a focus on working with new organisations and partners - to try new approaches where traditional approaches have not been successful. The British Government will then back the best of these.

Girls who are educated are more likely to:

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said:

Women and girls continue to bear the brunt of poverty. Investing in them early on and giving them an education not only radically alters their lives but has a massive knock on effect benefitting their families and communities. Girls who have been to school are likely to do significantly better financially, socially and be far healthier.

The action we are taking is ambitious and something of which Britain should be enormously proud. It will help to lift hundreds of thousands of girls out of poverty so that they can fulfil their potential.

International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell said:

Educating girls tackles the root causes of poverty. Research shows that providing girls with an extra year of schooling can increase their wages by up to 20 per cent, while also lowering birth rates, which can have a profound economic impact.

These initiatives will also have positive impacts on future generations. They will mean girls are more likely to go on to help their sisters and younger girls in the community to follow their example - go to school and widen their choices,  to get married later, for example, and to earn their own income.

The International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell will give more details at the UN General Assembly this week.

This new support is in addition to the Coalition Government’s commitment to support 9 million children from developing countries in primary and 2 million in secondary education by 2015."

The UK Government will provide advice and support to help thousands of survivors of domestic violence and help many more of the poorest girls and women to escape the threat of trafficking in Asia.

The drive comes as millions of people around the world mark International Women’s Day - an annual event to highlight girls’ and women’s right to equality.

International Development Secretary, Andrew Mitchell, who is speaking at Women for Women’s Join Me on the Bridge campaign for greater equality across the world later today, said:

It is shocking that for millions of the world’s poorest people their gender is the biggest barrier to a healthy and secure life. This is why the Government puts girls and women at the heart of all our development efforts.

Discrimination and violence destroys the potential of girls and women in developing countries and prevents them from pulling themselves out of poverty.

But today is not just about tackling abuse - I support Join Me on the Bridge because the UK is determined to back women taking an active part in peace building. It is only by men and women working together that we will see long-term peace and development.

Britain will help to end trafficking of up to 60,000 women and girls in South Asia in Bangladesh, Nepal and India by:

Vince Cable fleshed out the details of these proposals furtherin a speech to the Social Market Foundation earlier today.

The announcement follows on from adiscussion paper which explored the issues around executive payand company performance, and a consultation on improving company reporting.

Greater transparency 
More information on what benchmarks companies use to set executive pay and how pay policy relates to company strategy and performance; companies must produce a single figure for total pay and show how spend on executive pay compares with other payouts such as dividends and business investment.

More shareholder power
Government to consult on giving shareholders binding votes on executive pay policies and exit payments worth more than one year’s salary; and requiring companies to get 75 per cent (up from 50 per cent) shareholder support to pass the vote. Government to look at requiring clawback clauses to be introduced in all contracts so pay can be recovered if a company does badly.

More diversity
Renewed drive to get more people from different professional backgrounds onto company boards; Government to look at reducing the number of current executive directors serving on other companies’ remuneration committees.

Employee engagement
Companies to explain how they have consulted employees and taken account of employee pay when they set board pay. Government will also encourage employees to utilise their right to request that employers consult them on pay deals.

Following extensive engagement with businesses, the Department for International Trade (DIT) is making it easier for exporters and those considering exporting to access the information they need to export to the rest of Europe.

From queries around rules of origin, to guidance on recognising professional qualifications and entering new markets, the Export Support Service will provide a single point of contact. It will help exporters navigate a range of complex information simply and quickly.

Europe is a key destination for high-quality UK goods and services. In 2020 alone, the UK exported £288bn worth of goods to Europe - with medicinal and pharmaceutical products, and cars among the top five.

International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said:

We are listening to the needs of businesses and that’s why we’re launching this fantastic new one-stop shop service, making it easier for British companies to export to Europe.

We are focused on helping exporters fulfil their potential. Having a dedicated export support team at the end of a phone ready to help will ensure they can access the information they need, and get on with the job of selling their world-class products and services abroad, in turn helping the UK to build back better.

Minister of State at the Cabinet Office Lord Frost said:

We are continuing to support businesses across the UK to unlock trading opportunities with Europe and beyond.

By launching this new online service, we’re equipping companies up and down the country with the support and tools they need in one place to successfully export their products – ensuring that the best of British goods and services can reach European towns and cities.

Federation of Small Businesses National Chair Mike Cherry said:

In our recent export report we called for a single query point to help small businesses looking to either expand or begin their exporting journeys.

So we are pleased that government is now creating just that. Done right, this will be a major boost for small firms raising their sights to new growth markets around the globe.

One of the big barriers for small businesses trying to export has been access to key information and we hope this will provide welcome information and guide small exporters onto the market.

Confederation of British Industry’s International Director Andy Burwell said:

This new helpline and practical government support for UK exports to Europe is a real step forward, and in line with CBI calls to support firms with their exporting journey.

A free to use service to help businesses navigate trading with the UK’s biggest market will be hugely beneficial, particularly to SMEs.

If we are to transform the UK into a trading powerhouse, we need more companies exporting a greater range of products to an increasing number of markets. Our data shows supporting a new generation of SME exporters could boost UK export revenues by an additional £20bn by 2030.

Businesses will want to step up work with the government to seize the opportunities that trade brings to the economy, both across Europe and around the world.

The Food and Drink Federation’s Head of International Trade, Dominic Goudie said:

This new support from the Department for International Trade is most welcome and will help businesses that are facing challenges when moving goods into Europe.

Businesses have been badly hit, as highlighted in the FDF’s Export Snapshot published in September, so it is essential to have this support in place to aid business recovery and a return to export growth for our industry.

The service comes ahead of the upcoming launch of the government’s Export Strategy which aims to drive economic recovery and level up the entire country.

The strategy will promote UK business’s ability to seize the opportunities to sell goods and services around the globe. It will ensure our most productive businesses can compete using our new independent trade policy, supporting jobs and prioritising the UK’s most dynamic sectors."

A high number of respondents wanted to see clearer food labelling with a desire for greater information on the origins of food as well as its nutritional content. Clearer origin labelling is a key commitment in the Government’s Programme. The Government knows that consumers are particularly concerned about meat, dairy and meat products and that is why we have already started working with the food industry, retailers and others to encourage better labelling and greater adherence to the Food Standards Agency’s best practice guidance.

The Government recognises that the clear presentation of information on food labels is essential to help consumers make informed purchasing decisions. To help, the Food Standards Agency has produced guidelines on clear labelling and the criteria that affect clarity. The UK is currently negotiating in Europe a new regulation that should further improve information on food labels. The UK is also pushing in Europe to introduce mandatory nutrition labelling on all pre-packed foods throughout the EU. This will help in enabling consumers choose a healthier option.

There was also a lot of concern expressed on the issue of interest rates on credit and store cards. The cost of borrowing on credit and store cards has risen markedly in recent years, despite falls in the base rate of interest. We believe that more can be done to make this form of borrowing more affordable to consumers. That is why we have proposed to give regulators new powers to define and ban excessive interest rates on credit and store cards.

We will be exploring the issue of interest rate caps in more detail as part of our Consumer Credit and Personal Insolvency review which will be launched in the autumn. This review will be an opportunity to consider consumer credit policy and will cover all phases of the consumer credit lifecycle including the decision to borrow, the lifetime of a loan and what happens when things go wrong.

Currently, to be eligible for an audit exemption in the UK, small companies must be less than a certain size in terms of balance sheet and turnover.

The changes to regulations will align mandatory audit thresholds with accounting thresholds. This means small and medium-sized businesses will be able to obtain an exemption if they meet two out of three criteria relating to balance sheet total, turnover and number of employees. This change will allow 36,000 more companies to choose not to have an audit.

The new regulations are expected to come into force for accounting years ending on or after 1 October 2012.

Vince Cable said:

“Reporting requirements have become increasingly demanding and costly over the years. We listened to business, who made a strong case for reform, and I am delighted that we are now taking this opportunity to make audit more flexible and targeted.

“Tackling these problems will help save UK companies millions every year and free them up to expand and grow their business, which ultimately benefits the entire British economy.”

The Government will also exempt most subsidiary companies from mandatory audit, as long as their parent company guarantees their liabilities. A further 83,000 subsidiary companies will benefit.

In addition, another 67,000 dormant subsidiaries will no longer need to prepare and file annual accounts, provided they receive a similar guarantee.

The new regulations will remove EU gold-plating and ensure UK SMEs are not at a disadvantage compared to their European competitors.

These changes are part of the Government’s wider drive to reduce unnecessary burdens and make the UK one of the best places in the world to start, finance and grow a business.

Ross McAllister, Magnox programme delivery director said: “This is one of the largest decommissioning projects that Berkeley site has seen for several years.  It was originally planned for the 2070’s so it is fantastic to bring that forward by five decades in our aim to deliver our mission better, faster and even safer.

“The blower houses circulated gas through the reactors to transfer heat into 310 tonne boilers to create steam to turn the turbines and generate electricity. The last of the 15 gigantic metal boilers was transported to Sweden for cleaning, smelting and recycling in 2013.

“The buildings will be emptied of the residual metallic low-level waste and undergo a full asbestos clean before being demolished. The work is expected to take eight years to complete and will be another major step forwards in sustainably decommissioning Berkeley site with our supply chain partners.”

Following extensive procurement exercises, Altrad have been awarded a £30.8m contract for the design, asbestos removal, deplant, demolition and construction works in and around the blower houses and will be supported by other Celadon alliance companies including:

Kevin Williamson, Altrad’s General Manager for Magnox, said: “We are delighted to have secured this major decommissioning contract at Berkeley which encompasses the retrieval and cleaning of the primary circuit ductwork and miscellaneous steelwork from the blower houses, prior to their demolition – including the processing of the spring hangers from the lubrication pits, which need to be de-energised and made safe before they can be cleaned.”

Nuclear Decommissioning Authority operating company, Nuclear Waste Services (NWS) were awarded a £13.7m contract to manage 2,400 tonnes of metallic waste. Carly Sutton, WMS Consultant and Magnox Relationship Manager, NWS commented: “Through our metallic waste treatment service and working with our supply chain partner Augean we will establish a waste handling compound at Berkeley to provide a safe and secure undercover area where the metallic waste can be processed before it leaves the site for treatment.

“Removal of legacy metals from the Berkeley blower houses is significant not only in terms of achieving hazard reduction, but also good for environmental performance - as the high-quality steel removed will be treated, recycled and returned to the metal market for reuse.”

Chris Hannon, Augean Head of Radioactive Waste Services, added: “Augean is incredibly excited to be part of one of the largest metallic waste treatment projects in the UK for over a decade.  The metallic waste will be treated at Augean sites in the UK with over 95% of the metal being decontaminated to levels that allow recycling.   We’re working with a number of key subcontractors including NSG Environmental who will be leading the design of the waste handling compound.   This project is a core part of Augean’s strategy to deliver best environmental outcomes for our clients.”"

The award winners, representing a range of sectors and regions, fought off competition from over 1400 entrants to receive their awards and were congratulated by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said:

Good quality apprenticeships create a fairer society by giving hard working young people the chance to aim for their dream job whilst playing their part in building a stronger economy for Britain. This year’s winners are an inspiration. They show that apprenticeships are an incredible opportunity to gain the skills and knowledge you need to succeed.

Around half a million people a year take the chance to learn whilst they work and we are on track to celebrate a fantastic milestone – the two millionth apprentice since 2010. So my message to business is don’t stop now – take on an apprentice and invest in new talent.

National Apprenticeship Award winners

The Awards, now in their eleventh year, recognise excellence in two areas: businesses that grow their own talent with apprentices and apprentices who have made a significant contribution to their workplaces.

This year there was also a special recognition award for the armed forces, reflecting this year’s Centenary commemorations which mark 100 years since the start of World War One. The three armed forces were present at the event and received their awards on behalf of every apprentice throughout the Royal Navy, RAF and Army.

The three armed forces received their awards on behalf of every apprentice throughout the Royal Navy, RAF and Army.

Winners included Hayley James, Release Manager at IBM, who was crowned the Unilever Higher Apprentice of the Year 2014 after impressing a panel of judges from the employment and skills arena.

Hayley, 22, from Midhurst in West Sussex, said:

I chose to do an apprenticeship because I truly believe that there is no better way for me to achieve the career I want. Within 3 years I have already accomplished so much more than I could have possibly imagined. I aspire to become a future CEO of IBM and will be proud to say how I achieved all of this from being an apprentice. I hope to use this award to show people who may have misconceptions about apprenticeships that there is no difference between me and a graduate and raise the profile of apprenticeships, showing others what a fantastic opportunity it is.

Congratulations also goes to the Top 100 Apprenticeship Employers which were also announced last night. The list of Top 100 employers is compiled annually by the National Apprenticeship Service in partnership with City & Guilds and recognises excellence in businesses that employ apprentices. It features the most exceptional apprenticeship employers from all of the National Apprenticeship Awards employer categories and showcases the breadth of employers who now offer apprenticeships.

The Deputy Prime Minister continued:

The Top 100 Apprenticeship Employers have clearly demonstrated how apprenticeships have a major part to play in building great businesses. I would encourage more businesses across England to follow these shining examples and find out how apprenticeships can help them build a skilled, motivated and highly qualified workforce. For the Top 100 Apprentice Employers recognised in 2014, their great achievement clearly outlines why apprenticeships deliver the skills that young people and the economy need.

Skills Minister Nick Boles congratulated the award winners on their success:

The National Apprenticeship Awards are proof that businesses large and small really can reap the benefit of growing their own talent and that young people can succeed with an apprenticeship at some of the nation’s leading companies.  I congratulate all the winners and wish them the very best for the future.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and National Apprenticeship Award winners

Sara Caplan, Partner, PwC, Top 100 Apprenticeship Employer and winner of the Rolls Royce Newcomer Large Employer of the Year 2014 category, added:

We’re always on the lookout for talented people, irrespective of background or the career path they choose. Our apprentices start a career with real responsibility, supporting high-profile client work and developing the skills to succeed in business through a two year development programme, with the opportunity to progress to the very top of our organisation.

Apprentices help generate client revenue in a way that delivers value for everyone involved and coaching apprentices is also helping to develop our people managers. We now hope to encourage more employers in our sector to recognise the benefits of employing apprentices through our role in the Accountancy and Management Consultancy Trailblazer projects."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-measure-of-pensioner-poverty-announced,Press release,New measure of  pensioner poverty announced,A new way of measuring older people’s quality of life will has been introduced by the Government today.,Department for Work and Pensions and The Rt Hon Steve Webb,9 May 2011,"A new way of measuring older people’s quality of life will has been introduced by the Government today.

A ‘material deprivation’ indicator for pensioners will capture wider elements of everyday life many that people take for granted but are in fact key indications of older people’s experiences.

Pensions Minister, Steve Webb said:

Income is very important, which is why restoring the earnings link for the basic State Pension was one of the first things the Coalition did when it came to power. However, we want to be able to take a more rounded view. This new indicator raises important questions about how Government and wider third-sector organisations could go beyond the issue of income to help transform lives. This is early days, but we are piloting ways to help older people overcome social isolation.

The material deprivation indicator uses a set of goods, services and experiences to capture low standards of living and is designed to complement existing income-based measures.

It will be used, alongside existing income-based measures in the Households Below Average Income Report published in May 2010 using data for 2009/10. Child poverty has been measured in this way since 2004/5.

Figures show that there is only a small overlap in pensioners who are materially deprived and those on a low income, and 670,000 pensioners who are materially deprived do not have a low income.

Steve Webb was speaking at an event with organisations interested in older people’s issues today (Monday 9 May).

The indicator uses a set of fifteen goods, services and experiences which are judged to be the best discriminators of deprivation - such as whether someone can replace a cooker, take a holiday away from home or go out socially at least once a month. The full selection of items was arrived at following independent academic research and involved engaging with older people about the items and way in which the questions were asked.

Older people are asked whether they have the items and if not, why, with their responses used to judge if they are materially deprived.

This will complement the existing income based measures of poverty. We will continue to publish low income indicators of poverty within the Households Below Average Income series.

The questions and follow up questions were first introduced in the Family Resources Survey in May 2008. Indicative results are available for 2008/09 (published herehttp://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/hbai/technical_note_20110307.pdf), 11 percent of pensioners (900,000) are materially deprived,16 percent of pensioners (1.3 million) are in low income,3 percent of pensioners (200,000) are both materially deprived and in low income.

Material deprivation questions and what percentage of pensioners have the items:

Professor Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor at the UK Health Security Agency, said:

For many of us, the festive period is marked with parties and socialising with friends and family, meaning it’s not unusual to see an increase in flu at this time of year and this was anticipated. This is why we have been urging those eligible to take up a free flu vaccine. The good news if you did, is that you are less likely to be severely affected by flu. If you’re still offered a vaccine through local services, you should take it up as we could see high levels for some weeks still. This is particularly important if you’re a health and social care worker, as we know these services are under significant winter pressures right now.

If you have symptoms of flu or COVID-19 such as a high temperature, cough and feeling tired and achy, try to limit your contact with others, especially those who are vulnerable. If you have symptoms and need to leave the house, our advice remains that you should wear a face covering. Washing hands regularly and using and disposing tissues in bins can reduce the spread of respiratory illnesses.

Please note, due to the Christmas public holidays, a report will not be published in week 52. The next report will be published on Friday 3 January 2024.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency, said:

Flu cases and hospitalisations are continuing to increase this week so it’s vital that those eligible take up this last opportunity to book your jab through the NHSnational booking system.

The system closes after today and then you will only be able to get the vaccine through GPs and pharmacies during their festive opening hours.

There are other ways you can protect friends and family over the holiday season. If you are showing symptoms of flu or COVID-19 such as a high temperature, cough and feeling tired and achy, try to limit your contact with others, especially those who are vulnerable. Washing your hands regularly and using tissues can reduce the spread of respiratory illnesses.

Amy Douglas, Epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency, said:

Norovirus cases remain high, with the latest numbers remaining the highest reported at this time of year in a decade.

If you’ve caught the virus, take steps to avoid passing on the infection this festive season. The very young, elderly and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk of suffering more serious illness from norovirus. If you have diarrhoea and/or vomiting, avoid visiting people in hospitals and care homes to prevent spreading the infection in these settings.

If you are unwell, do not return to work, school or nursery until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped and don’t prepare food for others in that time either. Washing your hands with soap and warm water and using bleach-based products to clean surfaces will also help stop infections from spreading. Alcohol gels do not kill norovirus so don’t rely on these alone.

For the 2024-25 season’s vaccination programme, children and pregnant women have been eligible since 1 September, whilst clinical risk groups, older adults (those aged 65 years and over) and frontline healthcare workers have been eligible since 3 October.

Up to the end of week 49, vaccine uptake stands at:

39.7% of children aged 2 years of age and 41% of children aged 3 years of age have been vaccinated.

As we are still near peak levelsRSV, it’s important to know how to spot the signs of bronchiolitis in infants. Some of the main symptoms of a serious infection due toRSVinclude a cough that gets worse, shortness of breath, wheezy breathing, and difficulty feeding. You should seek medical help if you’re worried your child is seriously unwell and further advice can be found on theNHS website.

Since 1 September 2024, pregnant women have been offeredRSVvaccination around the time of their 28-week antenatal appointment. Having the vaccine in week 28 or within a few weeks of this will help build a good level of antibodies to pass on to their baby before birth. This will give the newborn baby the best protection, including if they are born early. Those who turn 75 and those age 75 to 79 are also eligible for a free NHS vaccine to protect them fromRSV.

Background:

For the first time this year, vaccination is being offered againstRSVfor anyone who is 28 or more weeks pregnant to protect their baby, along with people aged 75 to 79 years.

Ahead of the peak season, those eligible for the flu and COVID-19 vaccines are also reminded to get vaccinated as it offers the best protection heading into winter.

Norovirus activity has remained high in recent weeks. Since a drop in weeks 43 and 44, which coincided with the October half-term school holidays in England, norovirus reporting started to increase again in week 45.

Rotavirus reporting has started to increase in recent weeks but was within expected levels during the 2-week period of weeks 44 and 45.

The number of norovirus outbreaks reported to the Hospital Norovirus Outbreak Reporting System (HNORS) since the start of the 2024/2025 season is 5% higher than the 5-season average.

It is likely that multiple factors are contributing to the observed increase in laboratory reports, such as ongoing changes to the epidemiology following the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in testing and reporting to national surveillance.

During the 2024/2025 season to date, the majority (89%) of samples characterised were norovirus genogroup 2 (GII), of which the most frequently identified genotype was GII.17 (67%). An increase of this variant has also been observed in other counties during 2024 and is being closely monitored. At present there is no indication it leads to more severe illness. It isn’t accurate to refer to G11.17 as ‘Kawasaki’ and this term is causing confusion with Kawasaki Disease, which is an unrelated disease.

Norovirus symptoms include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea but can also include a high temperature, abdominal pain and aching limbs. Norovirus infections can cause dehydration, especially in vulnerable groups such as young children and older or immunocompromised people, so if you do get ill it is important to drink plenty of fluids during that time.

Lesley Larkin, Lead Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

Norovirus cases are on the rise again as we head into winter.

Take steps to avoid passing the infection on. If you have diarrhoea and/or vomiting, do not return to work, school or nursery until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped and don’t prepare food for others in that time either.

Up to the end of week 42, vaccine uptake stands at:

Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, Consultant Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

This week’s data shows that flu is gradually increasing but remains at low levels. COVID-19 continues to circulate at moderate levels and we encourage all those eligible to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and flu, as we expect both infections to increase in the coming weeks.

Our current surveillance shows that around 13% of sequenced COVID-19 cases are the ‘XEC’ lineage however current information doesn’t suggest we should be more concerned about this variant. We are monitoring this closely and vaccination still offers the best protection.

If you are showing symptoms of flu or COVID-19 such as a high temperature, cough, and feeling tired and achy, try to limit your contact with others, especially those who are vulnerable.

In week 42:

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

The latestRSVsurveillance is showing increasing cases in children under 5 years of age, as is typical for this time of the year, with increasing numbers of infants under 1 year old being seen in hospital emergency departments for bronchiolitis.

Vaccination programmes were launched in September to prevent severeRSVin infants and older adults. I would encourage anyone who is 28 or more weeks pregnant to have the vaccine to protect their baby, along with people aged 75-79 years who are also offered the vaccine by the NHS as part of the new programmes.

Washing your hands regularly and using tissues can reduce the spread ofRSVand other viruses. People who are unwell with colds should try and avoid visiting newborn babies and other vulnerable groups.

Since 1 September 2024, pregnant women have been offeredRSVvaccination around the time of their 28 week antenatal appointment. Having the vaccine in week 28 or within a few weeks of this will help build a good level of antibodies to pass on to their baby before birth. This will give the newborn baby the best protection, including if they are born early. Those who turn 75 and those age 75 to 79 are also eligible for a free NHS vaccine to protect them fromRSV.

In week 41:

Amy Douglas, epidemiologist atUKHSAsaid:

As we head into the winter season, we are seeing norovirus levels higher than usual, and we expect the virus to spread more in the coming weeks.

Recently, we’ve seen the biggest rise in cases in adults, especially those aged 65 and over.

To help reduce the spread of norovirus you can take steps to avoid passing the infection on. If you have diarrhoea and vomiting, do not return to work, school or nursery until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped and don’t prepare food for others in that time either. If you are unwell, avoid visiting people in hospitals and care homes to prevent passing on the infection in these settings.

Washing your hands with soap and warm water and using bleach-based products to clean surfaces will also help stop infections from spreading. Alcohol gels do not kill norovirus so don’t rely on these alone.

In week 41:

TheFlu, COVID-19 andRSVsurveillance reporthas been published. TheNorovirus surveillance reporthas been published.

Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, Consultant Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

This week’s data shows that COVID-19 remains at low to moderate levels. Flu positivity is gradually increasing, however levels remain low. We expect ral respiratory infections to increase as the season progresses, so don’t wait for it to hit your household, get vaccinated and make sure you are protected this winter.

Our current surveillance shows that around 1 in 10 sequenced covid cases are the ‘XEC’ lineage however information doesn’t suggest we should be more concerned about this variant. We are monitoring this closely and vaccination still offers the best protection.

If you are showing symptoms of flu or COVID-19 such as a high temperature, cough, and feeling tired and achy, try to limit your contact with others, especially those who are vulnerable.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

We are beginning to see cases ofRSVincreasing, as well as emergency department attendances for acute bronchiolitis, caused byRSV.

RSVlung infections like bronchiolitis are a major cause of babies needing to visitA&Eor be admitted to hospital each winter. TheRSVvaccine in pregnancy is an important step in keeping babies well.   Women who are 28 or more weeks pregnant should take it up now, along with people aged 75-79 years who are also offered the vaccine by the NHS as part of the new programmes.

If your baby has a cold that is getting worse, or that is causing unusual breathing or problems feeding, call NHS 111 or contact your GP practice. As a parent trust your judgement and if your baby seems seriously unwell go toA&Eor call 999.

There has been an increase GII.17 variant since April 2024, and during the first 14 weeks of the 2024/2025 season this was the most commonly detected norovirus genotype. The increase of the variant has been observed in other counties and is being closely monitored

Amy Douglas, epidemiologist atUKHSAsaid:

Norovirus levels have remained higher than expected recently and cases are likely to increase.

To help reduce the spread of the infection, if you have diarrhoea and vomiting, take steps to avoid passing the infection on. Do not return to work, school or nursery until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped and don’t prepare food for others in that time either.

The flu, COVID-19 andRSVsurveillance report has beenpublished here.

Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, Consultant Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

COVID-19 is continuing to circulate, with a slight increase in hospitalisations over the past two weeks. As winter approaches, we expect flu andRSVto increasingly circulate too, so if you’re eligible to get vaccinated against the three main winter threats – COVID-19, flu andRSV– now is the time to take them up and get winter strong.

We understand people may be concerned about new variants. Our surveillance shows that where covid cases are sequenced, around 1 in 10 are the ‘XEC’ lineage. Current information doesn’t suggest we should be more concerned about this variant but we are monitoring this closely. The most important thing to do is to get your vaccination as soon as possible if you’re eligible.

If you are showing symptoms of flu or COVID-19 such as a high temperature, cough, and feeling tired and achy, try to limit your contact with others, especially those who are vulnerable.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

We are starting to see the expected seasonal rise inRSV, a common lung virus which can cause pneumonia and infant bronchiolitis. Women who are 28 or more weeks pregnant and people aged 75 to 79 years who are offered the vaccine by the NHS as part of the newRSVvaccination programmes should take it up now.

RSVlung infections like bronchiolitis are a major cause of babies needing to visitA&Eor be admitted to hospital each winter. TheRSVvaccine for pregnant mums is an important step in keeping babies well through winter.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes atUKHSA, said:

Once again, COVID-19 cases and hospitalisations have risen this week, so now is the time to get your COVID-19 spring vaccine if you’re eligible and haven’t already.

The COVID-19 vaccine offers the best protection to those at risk as the virus spreads. If you’re 75 years old or older, a resident in a care home for older adults, or have a weakened immune system – book online atnhs.uk/get-vaccineor call 119 if you don’t have access to the internet. You don’t have to wait for the NHS to get in touch with you.

If you have symptoms of COVID-19 or flu try to stay at home as it helps protect others, especially those who are more vulnerable to these viruses. If you are unable to stay at home when unwell, consider wearing a mask.

Norovirus laboratory reports are still high for this time of year and haven’t started decreasing as we would usually expect in Spring

The total number of norovirus laboratory reports in April 2024 (weeks 14 to 17) was 75% higher than the 5-season average for the same 4-week period.

The drivers of the increase in reporting are currently being investigated and it is likely multiple factors are contributing to the rise, including but not limited to changes in the epidemiology following the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in testing and reporting to national surveillance, and the cold weather so far this spring.

While the total number of enteric virus (EV) outbreaks reported in April 2024 remained 23% lower than the 5-season average for the same period, reported outbreaks exceeded the 5-season average in week 16. The majority of outbreaks were reported in care home settings.

Please note the 5-season average is calculated from the same time period in the following seasons which excludes the COVID-19 pandemic period: 2015/2016, 2016/2017, 2017/2018, 2018/2019 and 2022/2023.

Amy Douglas, Norovirus Epidemiologist atUKHSAsaid:

Norovirus levels were higher in April than we would usually see at this time of year and have been increasing. This is likely due to a combination of factors, but the colder weather we have had won’t have helped.

Norovirus can cause dehydration, especially in vulnerable groups such as young children and older or immunocompromised people, so if you do get ill it is important to drink plenty of fluids.

If you have got diarrhoea and vomiting, you can take steps to avoid passing the infection on. Do not return to work, school or nursery until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped and don’t prepare food for others in that time either. If you are unwell, avoid visiting people in hospitals and care homes to prevent passing on the infection in these settings.

Washing your hands with soap and warm water and using bleach-based products to clean surfaces will also help stop infections from spreading. Alcohol gels do not kill norovirus so don’t rely on these alone.

We are always pleased to see decreases in flu and COVID-19 activity. However, these viruses are still circulating and causing serious illness and hospitalisations.

If you are showing symptoms of flu and COVID-19, try to stay at home to protect others, especially those who are vulnerable. If you need to go out while you are feeling unwell, consider wearing a mask when around people.

Simple steps like catching coughs and sneezes with a tissue, and regular handwashing can reduce the risk of spreading viruses. Improving fresh air circulation by opening a window whilst meeting indoors can also help minimise the spread.

This week’s report shows that flu and COVID-19 have remained stable. However, we’re seeing a small increase in COVID-19 hospital admissions for those aged over 85 which shows vulnerable people are still getting seriously ill from these viruses.

Simple steps such as using a tissue to catch coughs and sneezes, and regular handwashing can reduce the risk of passing on flu and COVID-19. Improving fresh air circulation, such as having a window open whilst meeting indoors can also help minimise the spread.

If you show symptoms of flu or COVID-19 like a high temperature, a cough, or feeling tired and achy, it’s important to limit your contact with others, especially those who are vulnerable. If you need to go out while you aren’t feeling well, consider wearing a mask around other people.

Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, Consultant Epidemiologist for Immunisation atUKHSAsaid:

Flu shows a continued decline in this week’s data, while COVID-19 remains stable. Although activity declines and remains low, people are still getting seriously ill from these viruses.

Catching your coughs and sneezes in a tissue, and frequent handwashing are simple measures that everyone can take to minimize the spread of viruses like flu and COVID-19. Improving fresh air circulation, such as having a window open during indoor gatherings, can also help reduce the spread.

If you are showing symptoms of flu or COVID-19 such as a high temperature, cough, and feeling tired and achy, try to limit your contact with others, especially those who are vulnerable. Consider wearing a mask if you do need to go out.

First monthly norovirus report highlights that norovirus activity has fluctuated recently. While laboratory reports between weeks 6 and 9 of 2024 were 15% higher than the 5-season average for the same 4-week period, compared to the same 4-week period last year reports were 29% lower.

The total number of enteric virus (EV) outbreaks reported between weeks 6 and 9 of 2024 remained 31% lower than the 5-season average for the same 4-week period. The majority of outbreaks were reported in care home settings.

Please note the 5-season average is calculated from the same time period in the following seasons which excludes the COVID-19 pandemic period: 2015/2016, 2016/2017, 2017/2018, 2018/2019 and 2022/2023.

Amy Douglas, Norovirus Epidemiologist atUKHSAsaid:

Reports of norovirus have fluctuated over the last month but still remain high. Norovirus symptoms include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea but can also include a high temperature, abdominal pain and aching limbs. Norovirus could cause dehydration, especially in vulnerable groups such as young children and older or immunocompromised people, so if you do get ill it is important to drink plenty of fluids during that time.

If you have got diarrhoea and vomiting, you can take steps to avoid passing the infection on. Do not return to work, school or nursery until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped and don’t prepare food for others in that time either. If you are unwell, avoid visiting people in hospitals and care homes to prevent passing on the infection in these settings.

Washing your hands with soap and warm water and using bleach-based products to clean surfaces will also help stop infections from spreading. Alcohol gels do not kill norovirus so don’t rely on these alone.

Overall, COVID-19 hospitalisations decreased to 3.7 per 100,000 in week 6 compared to 4.1 per 100,000 in the previous week.

COVID-19ICUadmissions remained low and stable at 0.16 per 100,000 in week 6.

The highest hospital admission rate is currently in West Midlands at 5.12 per 100,000.

Among age groups, those aged 85 years and over had the highest hospital admission rate, which decreased to 39.53 per 100,000. Most other age groups saw a decrease.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes atUKHSA, said:

Flu activity shows an overall decrease this week but an increase inICUadmissions shows that we are not out of flu season just yet, people are still becoming severely ill with the virus.

The flu vaccine offers the best protection against severe illness and is still available from your GP or local pharmacy until the end of March. You are eligible if you are over 65, a child aged 2 or 3, have a specific long-term health condition, are pregnant, work in healthcare, or care for others.

COVID-19 activity remains stable, with some indicators showing decreases.Last week, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) announced the eligible groups available for the 2024 spring COVID-19 vaccine.This now includes individuals aged over 6 months who are immunosuppressed, those who are aged 75 years and over and residents in a care home for older adults. NHS England will soon confirm how these eligible groups will be able to come forward for their vaccine.

There are simple actions we can all take to prevent viruses like flu and COVID-19 spreading. Washing your hands regularly, catching coughs and sneezes and letting fresh air into rooms and spaces. If you are showing symptoms of a respiratory illness, try to limit your contact with others, especially those more vulnerable, and consider wearing a mask if you do need to go out.

Norovirus laboratory reports in weeks 4 and 5 of 2024 were 52% higher than the 5-season average for the same period 2-week period, but within the overall historical range reported in the decade before the COVID-19 pandemic.

While reports of enteric virus (EV) outbreaks have been increasing, the total number ofEVoutbreaks reported during weeks 4 and 5 of 2024 remained 27% lower than the 5-season average for the same 2-week period. The majority of outbreaks were reported in care home settings

The timing of the peak of norovirus activity varies from one season to the next and this season the increase in reporting following Christmas has begun earlier compared to the 5-seasons from which the average is calculated.

Please note the 5-season average is calculated from the same time period in the following seasons which excludes the COVID-19 pandemic period: 2015/2016, 2016/2017, 2017/2018, 2018/2019 and 2022/2023.

Amy Douglas, Norovirus Epidemiologist atUKHSAsaid:

Reports of norovirus remain high. Norovirus symptoms include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea but can also include a high temperature, abdominal pain and aching limbs. Norovirus could cause dehydration, especially in vulnerable groups such as young children and older or immunocompromised people, so if you do get ill it is important to drink plenty of fluids during that time.

If you have got diarrhoea and vomiting, you can take steps to avoid passing the infection on. Do not return to work, school or nursery until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped and don’t prepare food for others in that time either. If you are unwell, avoid visiting people in hospitals and care homes to prevent passing on the infection in these settings.

Washing your hands with soap and warm water and using bleach-based products to clean surfaces will also help stop infections from spreading. Alcohol gels do not kill norovirus so don’t rely on these alone.

OverallRSVactivity continues to decrease.

The overall positivity (among people with symptoms tested at sentinel ‘spotter’ laboratories) decreased to 1.1%, with the highest positivity in those aged under 5 years at 1.9%.

The latestFlu and COVID-19 surveillance report, which includes respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) data
and thenational norovirus and rotavirus surveillance reporthave been published along with the latest public health advice.

Influenza activity showed a mixed picture, increasing in some indicators but decreasing in others.

Influenza positivity decreased to 14.3% in week 5 compared to 17.4% in the previous week. This is based on a percentage of people who test positive among those with symptoms tested at sentinel “spotter” laboratories, reported through the Respiratory DataMart surveillance system.

Through primary care surveillance, the influenza-like-illness (ILI) consultations indicator decreased slightly to 9.6 per 100,000 in week 5 compared to 9.8 per 100,000 in the previous week and remained within the baseline activity level range.

The total number of confirmed influenza acute respiratory incidents decreased slightly compared to the previous week, with 59 incidents reported in England during week 5.

Overall, influenza hospitalisations decreased slightly to 7.27 per 100,000 in week 5 compared to 7.43 per 100,000 in the previous week and remained in the medium impact range.

ICUorHDUadmissions rate decreased compared to the previous week and remained in the low impact range, while emergency department (ED) attendances forILIcontinued to increase in adults over 65 years old.

COVID-19 activity decreased across most indicators.

SARS-CoV-2 positivity decreased to 7.1% in week 5 compared to 8.0% in the previous week. This is based on a percentage of people who test positive among those with symptoms tested at sentinel “spotter” laboratories, reported through the Respiratory DataMart surveillance system.

COVID-19 case rates and positivity in Pillar 1 decreased overall and within some age groups, regions, and ethnic groups in week 5.

Overall, COVID-19 hospitalisations decreased to 4.1 per 100,000 in week 5 compared to 5.0 per 100,000 in the previous week.

COVID-19ICUadmissions remained low and stable at 0.14 per 100,000 in week 5.

The highest hospital admission rate is currently in South West England at 5.73 per 100,000. Throughout the regions, there was a mixed picture in hospital admission rates.

Among age groups, those aged 85 years and over had the highest hospital admission rate, which decreased to 45.03 per 100,000. Most other age groups saw a decrease.

A total of 7,858,122 people aged 65 years and over in England have been vaccinated with an autumn 2023 COVID-19 vaccine dose since 1 September 2023, totalling 70.4% of that population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes atUKHSA, said:

It’s encouraging to see signs of a decrease for COVID-19 activity. However an increase in emergency department attendances for flu-like-illness in those over age 65 shows that flu is still circulating in those who could be more vulnerable to severe illness, despite other indicators showing a decline.

A free flu vaccine is still available from your GP or local pharmacy until the end of March, so there is still time to get vaccinated. You are eligible if you are over 65, a child aged 2 or 3, have a specific long-term health condition, are pregnant, work in healthcare, or care for others.

Allowing fresh air in when meeting others indoors, practising regular handwashing, and covering coughs and sneezes helps reduce the spread of respiratory infections such as flu and COVID-19. If you are showing symptoms of a respiratory illness, try to limit your contact with others, especially those more vulnerable, and consider wearing a mask if you do need to go out.

Norovirus laboratory reports in weeks 3 and 4 of 2024 were 83% higher than the 5-season average for the same period 2-week period, but within the overall historical range reported in the decade before the COVID-19 pandemic. Reporting remains highest in adults aged 65 and older.

While reports of enteric virus (EV) outbreaks have been increasing, the total number ofEVoutbreaks reported during weeks 3 and 4 of 2024 remained 17% lower than the 5-season average for the same 2-week period. The majority of outbreaks were reported in care home settings, but the outbreaks reported in hospital settings have also been increasing in recent weeks.

The timing of the peak of norovirus activity varies from one season to the next and this season the increase in reporting following Christmas has begun earlier compared to the 5-seasons from which the average is calculated.

Please note the 5-season average is calculated from the same time period in the following seasons which excludes the COVID-19 pandemic period: 2015/2016, 2016/2017, 2017/2018, 2018/2019 and 2022/2023.

Dr Lesley Larkin, Interim Deputy Director, Gastrointestinal Infections and Food Safety (One Health) Division atUKHSAsaid:

The latest data show a notable increase in norovirus reports and reports of outbreaks in hospital settings are rising.

Norovirus symptoms include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea but can also include a high temperature, abdominal pain and aching limbs. Norovirus could cause dehydration, especially invulnerable groups such as young children and older or immunocompromised people, so if you do get ill it is important to drink plenty of fluids during that time.

If you have got diarrhoea and vomiting, you can take steps to avoid passing the infection on. Do not return to work, school or nursery until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped and don’t prepare food for others in that time either.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes atUKHSA, said:

This week our data shows that flu is on the rise and there is still time to get a flu vaccine up until the end of March, either free from your local pharmacy or your GP. Children aged 2 or 3 years can receive a quick and painless nasal spray flu vaccine from their GP to help protect them against flu.

There is less than a week to go before the window to book your COVID-19 vaccine closes on January 31. We’re urging all eligible people who have not yet done so to come forward so that they do not miss out on being protected against serious illness. You can find your closest walk-in COVID-19 vaccination site onthe NHS website.

If you are showing symptoms of a respiratory illness, limiting your contact with other people, especially those who are elderly or vulnerable, will help to prevent the spread of disease and protect those around us.

Norovirus laboratory reports in weeks 1 and 2 of 2024 were 40% higher than the 5-season average for the same period 2-week period. Reporting remains high in adults aged 65 and older.

The provisional proportion of people in England who have received the 2023 to 2024 influenza vaccine in targeted groups is as follows:

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes atUKHSA, said:

This week there has been a slight increase in flu levels but a continued decrease in COVID-19 rates.

Remember, flu and COVID-19 spread more easily during the colder months as we spend more time indoors. If you are showing symptoms of a respiratory illness, try to reduce your contact with others, especially those who are vulnerable.

It is less than two weeks until this season’s COVID-19 vaccination campaign closes. If you are eligible, you can still get vaccinated for flu and COVID-19. Some local pharmacies continue to offer flu and walk-in COVID-19 vaccinations for free on the NHS. Children aged 2 or 3 years can receive a quick and painless nasal spray flu vaccine from their GP to help protect them against flu.

RSVactivity continues to decrease.

The overall positivity (among people with symptoms tested at sentinel ‘spotter’ laboratories) decreased to 3%, with the highest positivity in those aged under 5 years at 5.7%.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

RSVcases overall are decreasing, including in children below 5 years old, but the virus is still circulating and being detected in young children and older adults admitted to hospital with breathing difficulties.

RSVinfections are usually mild but can cause breathing difficulties in babies and the elderly. Initial symptoms in infants are similar to a cold but can go on to include breathing more quickly or noisily and having difficulties feeding. For more information and advice, search for bronchiolitis on the NHS website.

You can protect yourself and others by washing your hands regularly, using a tissue to catch coughs or sneezes and washing your hands afterwards, and staying away from others if you feel unwell.RSVis another reason why babies need protection from tobacco smoke as this is linked with more severeRSVinfections.

Norovirus laboratory reports in weeks 52 of 2023 and 1 of 2024 were 48% higher than the 5-season average for the same period 2-week period. Reporting remains high across all age groups, but particularly in adults aged 65 and older.

The total number of Enteric Virus (EV) outbreaks reported during weeks 52 of 2023 and 1 of 2024 remained lower than the 5-season average for the same 2-week period, with the majority of outbreaks reported in care home settings.

Amy Douglas, Norovirus Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

The latest data show that norovirus cases were nearly 50% higher than average for this point in the season. We have also been seeing higher levels of other gastrointestinal infections, such as shiga toxin-producing E.coli.

If you have got diarrhoea and vomiting, you can take steps to avoid passing the infection on. Do not return to work, school or nursery until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped and don’t prepare food for others in that time either. If you are unwell, avoid visiting people in hospitals and care homes to prevent passing on the infection in these vulnerable settings.

Washing your hands with soap and warm water and using bleach-based products to clean surfaces will also help stop infections from spreading. Alcohol gels do not kill norovirus so don’t rely on these alone.

The latestnational flu and COVID-19 surveillance report, which includes respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) data, andnational norovirus and rotavirus surveillance reporthave been published along with the latest public health advice.

COVID-19 activity decreased across most indicators.

As reported in ourlatest Winter COVID-19 Infection Study (WCIS) data, estimated prevalence fell to 3.1% (one in 32 people) across England and Scotland in the 2 weeks to 3 January, down from 4.2% (one in 24 people) in the 2 weeks to 13 December.

In this week’s surveillance report, data on JN.1, a sub lineage of BA 2.86 is reported, and this designation has been applied retrospectively to previous weeks’ data. This variant is estimated to be currently responsible for 60% of cases in England.

SARS-CoV-2 positivity decreased slightly to 9.9% in week 1 compared to 10.2% in the previous week. This refers to the percentage of people who test positive among those with symptoms tested at sentinel “spotter” laboratories, reported through the Respiratory DataMart surveillance system.

COVID-19 case rates and positivity in Pillar 1 decreased, with decreases observed in some age groups, regions, and ethnic groups in week 1.

The total number of reported SARS-CoV-2 confirmed acute respiratory incidents in week 1 remained stable compared to the previous week, with 51 incidents reported in England during week 1.

Overall, COVID-19 hospitalisations decreased to 4.9 per 100,000 in week 1 compared to 5.2 per 100,000 in the previous week.

COVID-19ICUadmissions decreased in week 1 compared to the previous week.

The highest hospital admission rate is currently in South West at 6.05 per 100,000. Most regions experienced an decrease in hospital admission rates this week.

Among age groups, those aged 85 years and over had the highest hospital admission rate, reaching 51.97 per 100,000, with decreases observed in all other age groups except those aged 5 to 14 years, which remained stable.

The overall weeklyICUorHDUadmission rate for COVID-19 decreased to 0.14 per 100,000, compared to 0.25 per 100,000 in the previous week. TheICUorHDUadmission rate for COVID-19 byUKHSAregion or by age group fluctuated at low levels in week 1 due to low underlying numbers.

A total 7,840,192 people aged 65 years and over in England have been vaccinated with an autumn 2023 COVID-19 booster dose since 1 September 2023, totalling 70.2% of that population.

Influenza activity decreased across some indicators, including hospital admissions, but increased in others.

Influenza positivity decreased to 9.6% in week 1 compared to 12.1% in the previous week. This refers to the percentage of people who test positive among those with symptoms tested at sentinel “spotter” laboratories, reported through the Respiratory DataMart surveillance system.

Through primary care surveillance, the influenza-like-illness (ILI) consultations indicator increased to 7.5 per 100,000 in week 1 compared to 4.9 per 100,000 the previous week and remained within the baseline activity level range.

There were 21 influenza confirmed acute respiratory incidents reported in England in week 1.

Influenza hospitalisations decreased from 6.23 per 100,000 in week 52 to 5.08 per 100,000 in week 1 and remained in the medium impact range.

Intensive care unit (ICU) or high dependency unit (HDU) admissions decreased compared to the previous week and remained in the low impact range. Emergency department (ED) attendances forILIdecreased nationally.

In week 1, the overallICUorHDUrate for influenza decreased slightly to 0.14 per 100,000 compared to 0.17 per 100,000 in the previous week. The rate last week remained within baseline activity levels.

The provisional proportion of people in England who have received the 2023 to 2024 influenza vaccine in targeted groups is as follows:

77.1% in all aged 65 years and over; vaccine uptake is lower compared to the equivalent week in the 2022 to 2023 season

43.5% in all aged 3 years, which is comparable compared to the equivalent week in the 2022 to 2023 season

43.2% in all aged 2 years, which is higher compared to the equivalent week in the 2022 to 2023 season

40.4% in those aged under 65 years in a clinical risk group, which is lower compared to the equivalent week in the 2022 to 2023 season

31% in all pregnant women, which is lower compared to the equivalent week in the 2022 to 2023 season

Dr Alexander Allen, Consultant Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

It’s promising that we see a decline in both flu hospital admissions and COVID-19, but this may be partly down to how people mix and seek health services differently over the Christmas period. Some indicators show that flu cases in the community are on the rise, so we are not out of flu season just yet.

Flu and COVID-19 spread more easily as we spend more time indoors during the colder months. If you are showing symptoms of a respiratory illness, try to reduce contact with others, especially those who are vulnerable.

Time is now running out to get a flu and COVID-19 vaccine if you’re eligible. With just weeks left, those aged over 65 years, pregnant women, and clinical risk groups can still speak to their GP about getting vaccinated. Children aged 2 or 3 years can receive a quick and painless nasal spray flu vaccine from their GP to help protect them against flu. Local pharmacies also continue to offer flu and walk-in COVID-19 vaccinations for free on the NHS.

RSVactivity has decreased but is still circulating.

The overall positivity (among people with symptoms tested at sentinel ‘spotter’ laboratories) decreased to 4.5%, with the highest positivity in those aged under 5 years at 10.5%.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

RSVcases overall are decreasing, including in children aged under 5 years, but the virus is still circulating and being detected in young children and older adults admitted to hospital with breathing difficulties.

RSVinfections are usually mild but can cause breathing difficulties in babies and the elderly. Initial symptoms in infants are similar to a cold but can go on to include breathing more quickly or noisily and having difficulties feeding. For more information and advice, search forbronchiolitis on the NHS website.

Norovirus laboratory reports in weeks 51 and 52 were 48% higher than the 5-season average for the same period 2-week period. The highest rates of reporting were in children aged under 5 years and adults aged 65 years and over.

The total number ofEVoutbreaks reported during weeks 51 and 52 remained lower than the 5-season average for the same 2-week period, with the majority of outbreaks reported in care home settings.

Amy Douglas, Norovirus Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

At the end of December, norovirus cases were nearly 50% higher than average for that time of year. We have also been seeing higher levels of other gastrointestinal infections, such as shiga toxin-producing E.coli.

If you have got diarrhoea and vomiting, you can take steps to avoid passing it on. Do not return to work, school or nursery until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped and don’t prepare food for others in that time either. If you are unwell, avoid visiting people in hospitals and care homes to avoid passing on the infection in these vulnerable settings.

Washing your hands with soap and warm water and using bleach-based products to clean surfaces will also help stop infections from spreading. Alcohol gels do not kill norovirus so don’t rely on these alone.

The latestnational flu and COVID-19 surveillance report, which includes respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) data, andnational norovirus and rotavirus surveillance report, have been published along with the latest public health advice.

Overall COVID-19 activity showed mixed activity between week 52 and 51, whilst we have seen increases since the publication of our previous report in week 50.

SARS-CoV-2 positivity decreased to 10.1%, from 11.2% in the previous week, according to data from Respiratory DataMart.

COVID-19 case rates and positivity in Pillar 1 remained stable, with decreases observed in some age groups, regions, and ethnic groups in week 52.

The total number of reported SARS-CoV-2 confirmed acute respiratory incidents remained stable compared to the previous week, with 50 incidents reported in England during week 52.

COVID-19 hospitalisations increased to 5.2 per 100,000 in week 52, compared to 4.8 per 100,000 in the previous week. Hospitalisations were highest in the group of those aged 85 years and over.

COVID-19ICUadmissions increased in week 52 compared to the previous week.

Two-thirds (66%) of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 cases were classified as BA.2.86 (V-23AUG-01) in week 52.

The highest hospital admission rate is currently in South West at 6.48 per 100,000. Most regions experienced an increase in hospital admission rates this week.

Among age groups, those aged 85 years and over had the highest hospital admission rate, reaching 55.01 per 100,000, with increases observed in all other age groups except those aged 5 to 14 years.

The overall weeklyICUorHDUadmission rate for week 51 increased to 0.24 per 100,000 from 0.15 per 100,000 in the previous week. TheICUorHDUadmission rate increased at low levels in week 52 acrossUKHSAregions and age groups.

A total of 7,835,586 people aged 65 and over in England have been vaccinated with an autumn 2023 COVID-19 booster dose since 1 September 2023, totalling 70.2% of that population.

Through Respiratory DataMart, influenza positivity increased slightly to 11.8% in week 52 compared to week 51 11.2% in the previous week.

Primary care surveillance indicated a decrease in influenza-like-illness (ILI) consultations to 4.9 per 100,000 in week 52 compared to 7.7 per 100,000 the previous week and remained within the baseline activity level range.

During week 52, 14 confirmed influenza acute respiratory incidents were reported in England.

Influenza hospitalisations increased to 6.8 per 100,000 from 5.1 per 100,000 last week, and has crossed the medium impact threshold.

Intensive care unit (ICU) or high dependency unit (HDU) admissions increased compared to the previous week and remained the low impact threshold. Emergency department attendances forILIincreased nationally.

Weekly influenza vaccine uptake for the 2023 to 2024 season showed higher rates for those aged 2 years and those aged 3 years, but lower rates for those aged 65 years and over, pregnant women, and those under 65 years in clinical risk groups compared to the equivalent week in the previous season (2022 to 2023).

The overall fluICUorHDUrate increased to 0.17 per 100,000 compared to 0.10 per 100,000 in the previous week.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes atUKHSA, said:

Over the festive period, we have seen an increase in both COVID-19 and flu activity. More socialising indoors during periods of cold weather allows viruses to spread more easily. It’s likely that we could see further increases as we head further into winter and the weather drops colder. The winter peak for flu is still to come and may coincide with high levels of COVID-19.

As we head back to work or school, the best way to help stop the spread of respiratory infections, like COVID-19 and flu, when you are unwell, is to reduce contact with other people, especially those who are vulnerable. If you have symptoms such as a continuous cough, sore throat or high temperature, try to reschedule your plans until you feel better in order to protect others.

Remember that it’s still not too late to get a flu and COVID-19 vaccine if you’re eligible. Those eligible for a flu and COVID-19 vaccine, such as those aged over 65, pregnant women, and clinical risk groups can still speak to their GP about getting vaccinated. Local pharmacies also continue to offer both bookable flu and walk-in COVID-19 vaccinations for free on the NHS. Children aged 2 or 3 years are also eligible for a quick and painless nasal spray flu vaccine from their GP.

It’s fine to send your child to school or nursery with aminor coughorcommon coldif they are otherwise well and do not have a high temperature. But if your child has a fever, they should stay home from school or nursery until they feel better, and the fever has resolved.

RSVactivity has decreased but is still circulating widely.

The overall positivity (among people with symptoms tested at sentinel ‘spotter’ laboratories) decreased to 5.8%, with the highest positivity in those aged under 5 years at 14.2%.

The latestnational flu and COVID-19 surveillance report, which includes respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) data, andnational norovirus and rotavirus surveillance report, have been published along with the latest public health advice.

There continues to be a notable increase in influenza positivity to 8.9%, up from 4.9% in the previous week, based on data from Respiratory DataMart.

Primary care surveillance indicated a rise in influenza-like-illness (ILI) consultations to 6.3 per 100,000, compared to 5.3 per 100,000 in the previous week, remaining within the baseline activity level range.

During week 50, 12 confirmed influenza acute respiratory incidents were reported in England.

Influenza hospitalisations increased to 3.46 per 100,000 from 1.95 per 100,000 last week, and is rapidly approaching the medium impact threshold in week 50. Intensive care unit (ICU) or high dependency unit (HDU) admissions increased slightly compared to the previous week and are approaching the low impact threshold.

Emergency department attendances forILIincreased nationally.

Weekly influenza vaccine uptake for the 2023 to 2024 season showed higher rates for those aged 2 years and those aged 3 years, but lower rates for those aged 65 years and over, pregnant women, and those under 65 years in clinical risk groups compared to the equivalent week in the previous season (2022 to 2023).

Monthly vaccine uptake data for school-aged children, frontline healthcare workers and GP patients, was published today for the period 1 September to 30 November 2023, with comparator figures for previous seasons. All data is provisional and available from:

UKHSAhas now advised the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) that the rates of influenza circulating in the community support the use of antiviral medication for some patients presenting withILIin hospitals or at GP surgeries.

The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and Chief Pharmaceutical Officer (CPhO) for England have written to health professionals to authorise prescribing of these antivirals in NHS primary care and dispensing through community pharmacy. Hospitals can already use influenza antivirals year-round.

When used for treatment or post-exposure prophylaxis of patients at risk of influenza complications,antivirals are effective in reducing hospitalisationand preventing influenza illness.UKHSAguidance advises testing to rule out COVID-19 as a minimum before prescribing.

Overall COVID-19 activity increased in most regions, ethnicities, and age groups.

SARS-CoV-2 positivity increased to 9.2%, up from 7.2% in the previous week, according to data from Respiratory DataMart.

COVID-19 case rates and positivity in Pillar 1 increased overall and within most age groups, regions, and ethnic groups in week 50.

The total number of reported SARS-CoV-2 confirmed acute respiratory incidents remained stable compared to the previous week, with 39 incidents reported in England during week 50.

COVID-19 hospitalisations increased to 4.68 per 100,000 in week 50, compared to 3.89 per 100,000 in the previous week. Hospitalisations were highest in the group of those aged 85 years and over.

COVID-19ICUadmissions remained low and stable in week 50 compared to the previous week.

The highest hospital admission rate was observed in the West Midlands, rising to 6.08 per 100,000. The remaining regions experienced an increase in hospital admission rates.

Among age groups, those aged 85 years and over had the highest hospital admission rate, reaching 52.14 per 100,000, with increases observed in all other age groups except those aged 5 to 14 years.

The overall weeklyICUorHDUadmission rate for COVID-19 remained very low at 0.15 per 100,000, showing a slight increase from 0.14 per 100,000 in the previous week.

TheICUorHDUadmission rate fluctuated at low levels in week 50 acrossUKHSAregions and age groups, reflecting the impact of low underlying numbers.ICUorHDUadmission rates may indicate a lag from hospital admission to transfer to anICUorHDUward.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes atUKHSA, said:

The effects of the recent cold weather and increased socialising indoors in the run-up to Christmas are unsurprisingly causing flu and COVID-19 to spread more easily and numbers infected going up further.

If you are eligible for a flu and COVID-19 vaccine you can still speak to your GP about getting vaccinated to help protect you from these infections. Alternatively, local pharmacies continue to offer both bookable flu and walk-in COVID-19 vaccinations for free on the NHS.

Nobody wants to get their new year off to a bad start, so be sure to gift yourself the best possible protection against flu and COVID-19 as we head into peak season.

Pregnant women and those in clinical risk groups are at higher risk of complications from flu but over 60% of these groups remain unvaccinated, so we urge them to come forward. Children aged 2 or 3 years are also eligible for a quick and painless nasal spray flu vaccine, which helps prevent hospitalisations, as well as helps parents from not having to juggle a poorly child with work and other commitments.

If you are showing signs of a respiratory illness, like flu and COVID-19, try to limit your contact with others as much as possible, particularly those who are more vulnerable.

RSVactivity has decreased but is still circulating widely.

The overall positivity (among people with symptoms tested at sentinel ‘spotter’ laboratories) decreased to 8.5% (compared to 10.1% the previous week), with the highest positivity in those aged under 5 years at 23.1%.

Norovirus activity (based on lab reports) during weeks 48 and 49, 2023, was 29% higher than the 5-season average for the same 2-week period. The majority of reportedEVoutbreaks occurred in care home settings (61%).

Amy Douglas, Norovirus Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

Norovirus cases continue to rise, especially among those 65 years and over and in care homes.

If you have norovirus or any other stomach bug that causes diarrhoea and vomiting, you can take steps to avoid passing it on to family and friends over the festive period. Don’t prepare food for others if you have symptoms or for 48 hours after symptoms stop. Many of us will be travelling for Christmas, but you should avoid visiting people in hospitals and care homes to avoid passing on the infection in these settings. Do not return to work or school once term restarts, until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped.

Washing your hands with soap and water and using bleach-based products to clean surfaces will also help stop infections from spreading.

Flu levels are starting to rise, so get your vaccine now to get winter strong. Pregnant women, their unborn babies and those in clinical risk groups are at higher risk of complication from flu. Taking up both the flu and COVID-19 vaccines provides the best protection for both pregnant women and their baby, reducing the risk of severe complications, intensive care needs, stillbirth, and prematurity.

If you are the parent of a child aged 2 or 3 years, don’t forget that they are also eligible for the flu vaccine and this can be booked via your GP – the nasal spray will help prevent hospitalisations, reduce the spread of flu in the community and avoid you having to juggle a sick child with work and other commitments.

The NHS national booking system closed yesterday. But eligible persons can still continue to speak to their GP, or alternatively a local pharmacist about getting their vaccination.

Millions of eligible people are missing out on vital vaccinations that will provide protection against severe disease this winter. Flu levels are starting to rise, soget your vaccine nowto get winter strong and keep your festive plans on track. Pregnant women, their unborn babies and those in clinical risk groups are at higher risk of complication from flu. Vaccinating pregnant women also helps to provide protection to newborn babies who will be born during the flu season.

If you are the parent of a child aged 2 or 3 years, don’t forget that they are also eligible for the flu vaccine and this can be booked via your GP – the nasal spray will help prevent hospitalisations, reduce the spread of flu in the community and avoid you having to juggle a sick child with work and other commitments.

Since week 44 of the 2023 to 2024 season, the number of norovirus lab reports has been increasing, particularly in children aged 0 to 4 years. However, the total number of norovirus laboratory reports during weeks 46 and 47 was 16% lower than the 5-season average for the same 2-week period.

Overall, the number of reported enteric virus (EV) outbreaks has been increasing since week 43, although the total number ofEVoutbreaks reported during weeks 46 and 47 remained lower than the 5-season average for the same 2-week period. The majority of reportedEVoutbreaks occurred in care home settings (71%).

Dr Lesley Larkin, Interim Deputy Director, Gastrointestinal Infections and Food Safety (One Health) Division atUKHSA, said:

While reports of norovirus cases have been rising across all age groups, in recent weeks the increase has been highest in children aged 0 to 4 years. As norovirus activity increases it’s important we take steps to try and stop it spreading. If you or a family member have been sick with norovirus, you should avoid visiting hospitals and care homes, and not return to work, school or nursery, until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped.

Using bleach-based products to clean surfaces will also help stop the virus from spreading. Make sure to drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration, which can result in hospitalisation, particularly for the most vulnerable.

Most indicators show that flu activity has remained stable and within baseline levels this week.

ICUandHDUadmission rates for this week’s report remained low and stable.

Hospital admission rates have continued to decrease in most age groups.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 were highest in London at 3.54 per 100,000 population this week.

A total of 7,624,286 people aged 65 and over in England have been vaccinated with an autumn 2023 COVID-19 booster dose since 1 September 2023, totalling 68.3% of that population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

Over half of those aged under 65 years in a clinical risk group, and over two-thirds of pregnant women have not yet come forward for their flu vaccine this winter. Getting vaccinated as soon as possible will help reduce your risk of getting seriously ill with flu or COVID-19 this festive season. The vaccines can take a week or two to provide maximum protection so get booked in now to keep your Christmas plans on track.

You can help reduce the spread of these infections by avoiding mixing with others where possible when showing signs of a respiratory illness like flu and COVID-19, particularly those who are more vulnerable.

Since week 44 of the 2023/2024 season, the number of norovirus laboratory reports has increased. However, during weeks 45 and 46, the total number of norovirus laboratory reports was 20% lower than the 5-season average for the same 2-week period.

Overall, the number of reported enteric virus (EV) outbreaks has been increasing since week 43. However, the total number ofEVoutbreaks reported during weeks 45 and 46 remained lower than the 5-season average for the same 2-week period. The majority of reportedEVoutbreaks occurred in care home settings (66%).

Amy Douglas, Norovirus Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

As norovirus activity increases it’s important we take steps to try and stop it spreading. If you or a family member have been sick with norovirus, you should avoid visiting hospitals and care homes, and not return to work or school, until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped.

Hand gels do not kill norovirus, so handwashing with soap and warm water is best. Using bleach-based products to clean surfaces will also help stop the virus from spreading.

Make sure to drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration, which can result in hospitalisation, particularly for the most vulnerable.

RSVactivity remains high in a number of indicators, as is expected at this time of the year, reflecting high activity in children aged below 5 years of age.

The overall positivity (among people with symptoms tested at sentinel ‘spotter’ laboratories) was 13.0%, with the highest positivity in those aged under 5 years at 37.2%.

Emergency department attendances for acute bronchiolitis andRSVhospital admissions remained high, primarily due to cases in children under 5 years of age.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

RSVis continuing at high seasonal levels, as is expected at this time of the year. Many young children are needing NHS care forRSVlung infections, and admissions are increasing in older adults.UKHSAcontinues to monitorRSVactivity closely.

RSVinfections are usually mild but can cause breathing difficulties in babies and the elderly. Initial symptoms in infants are similar to a cold but can go on to include breathing more quickly or noisily and having difficulties feeding.

If your baby has a cold that is getting worse, or it is causing unusual breathing or problems feeding, call NHS 111 or contact your GP practice. As a parent, you should trust your own judgement and call 999 or go toA&Eif your child seems seriously unwell.

You can protect yourself and others by washing your hands regularly, using a tissue to catch coughs or sneezes and washing your hands afterwards, and staying away from others if you feel unwell.RSVis another reason why babies need protection from tobacco smoke as this is linked with more severeRSVinfections.

The overall positivity (among people with symptoms tested at sentinel ‘spotter’ laboratories) forRSVincreased slightly to 12.5% with the highest positivity in those aged under 5 years at 38.7%.

Emergency departments attendances for acute bronchiolitis continued to increase nationally, as did hospital admission rates forRSV. Hospital admission rates forRSVamong those under 5 years decreased.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

RSVis a seasonal virus and cases in young children typically go up from October to a peak in late November or December.UKHSAsurveillance suggests that while many young children are needing NHS assessment and care for conditions caused byRSV, case numbers may be showing some signs of stabilising compared to recent marked increases. We continue to monitorRSVactivity closely.

Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, Consultant Epidemiologist for Immunisation atUKHSAsaid:

Our weekly surveillance shows flu levels remain generally stable, although we are now starting to see a slight increase in cases among young children. We will continue to monitor these rates closely as we approach the winter period, where we expect to see a rise in prevalence. This week, once again we see a decrease in COVID-19 activity.

We remind people that if you are experiencing symptoms of a respiratory illness, you should avoid mixing with others where possible to stop the spread of viruses like flu and COVID-19.

Heading into winter, the flu vaccine continues to offer the best protection against what can be a very severe illness for the more vulnerable, including pregnant women as well as those aged 2 and 3 years who are all eligible for a free NHS vaccine. You canbook your flu and COVID-19 vaccinations and check your eligibility online.

Hand gels do not kill norovirus, so handwashing with soap and warm water is best. Using bleach-based products to clean surfaces will also help stop the virus from spreading.

Make sure to drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration which can result in hospitalisation, particularly for the most vulnerable.

The pneumococcal vaccine is also available for those aged 65 years and over. The vaccine helps protect against a common bacterial infection that can cause serious illnesses like:

It can also help protect against other illnesses such as sinusitis and ear infections.

You can contact your GP surgery for further information, and to book the pneumococcal vaccine.

Thisweekly flu and COVID-19 reportbrings together the latest surveillance data along with the latest public health advice.

Multiple indicators show that COVID-19 case rates have slightly decreased compared to the previous week.

A total of 10.9% of 4,751 respiratory specimens reported through the Respiratory DataMart System were identified as COVID-19. A decrease compared to 12.0% of 3,848 from the previous report.

Pillar 1 positivity for this week’s report is 16.7% with 623 cases, a decrease from 17.5% with 552 in the previous week.

The overall COVID-19 hospital admission rate is 5.25 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 6.13 per 100,000 in the previous week.

Intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates for this week’s report are 0.14 per 100,000 population and continue to remain low. This is a decrease from 0.20 per 100,000 from the previous week.

Hospital admission rates have decreased in all age groups, except the group of those aged 5 to 14 years, who have remained stable.

Those aged 85 years and over continue to have the highest hospital admission rates; these have decreased to 55.59 per 100,000 population from 62.72 per 100,000 in the previous week.

Admission rates among those aged 75 to 84 years have decreased to 26.14 per 100,000 population from 30.04 per 100,000 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 continue to be the highest in the South West, but decreasing to 7.85 per 100,000 population this week.

A total 46.8% (5,222,091 out of 11,164,326) of all people aged over 65 years who are living and resident in England have been vaccinated with an autumn 2023 booster dose since 1 September 2023.

New analysis by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) indicates that the autumn 2022 booster programme prevented an estimated 14,400 hospitalisations.

Multiple indicators show that flu case rates remain low and stable.

Through Respiratory DataMart, influenza positivity increased slightly to 1.5% in week 41 compared to 1.4% in the previous week.

The overall flu hospital admission for this week was 0.17 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 0.13 per 100,000 from the previous week.

FluICUadmission rates remain at baseline levels.

Those aged 0 to 4 continue to have the highest level of hospital admissions with a rate of 0.64 per 100,000 population.

The provisional proportion of people in England who have received the 2023 to 2024 influenza vaccine in targeted groups is as follows:

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes atUKHSA, said:

This week’s surveillance report shows a small decrease in COVID-19 infection rates and low levels of flu activity.

Now is a great time to get winter strong and protect yourself before the anticipated rise in cases through the colder months. We will continue to monitor rates closely and remind people that when you have respiratory symptoms you should avoid mixing with others, especially those who are particularly vulnerable.

It is great to see even more people come forward for both their COVID-19 and flu jabs this week. You can nowbook a flu vaccination online, the same way you would with the COVID-19 vaccine. You don’t have to wait for an invitation from your GP or the NHS before booking an appointment.

Young children continue to be the age group with the highest rates of hospitalisation with flu. Young children aged 2 to 3 years are eligible for a simple nasal spray flu vaccine, and you can help protect yourself and your child even before birth by getting vaccinated while you are pregnant. The flu vaccine is the best protection against serious illness and hospitalisation.

The overall positivity* for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) increased slightly to 4.3%, with the highest positivity in those aged under 5 years at 19.6%.

*among people with symptoms tested at sentinel ‘spotter’ laboratories, reported through the Respiratory Datamart surveillance system

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

As expected at this time of year, we are starting to see a rise inRSVinfections in young children. While usually mild, the infection can cause breathing difficulties for babies and the elderly. Initial symptoms in infants are similar to a cold, but can go on to include breathing more quickly or noisily and having difficulties eating. If your baby has a cold that is getting worse, or it is causing unusual breathing or problems feeding, call NHS 111 or contact your GP practice. As a parent, you should trust your own judgement and call 999 or go toA&Eif your child seems seriously unwell such as difficulty breathing, having blue or grey lips, or if they are floppy and will not wake up or stay awake.

You can protect yourself and others by washing your hands regularly, using a tissue to catch coughs or sneezes and washing your hands afterwards, and staying away from others if you feel unwell. It is also important to not smoke around babies.

Norovirus laboratory reports decreased in recent weeks and during the 2-week period of the 2023/2024 season (weeks 39 and 40) were 23% lower than the 5-season average of the same period.

Overall, the total number of reported enteric virus (including norovirus) outbreaks reported during weeks 39 and 40 remained lower than the 5-season average for the same 2-week period. The majority of outbreaks were in educational settings.

Amy Douglas, Norovirus Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

While norovirus cases are still low, we expect levels to rise as we head into winter. Outbreaks in schools have already started to increase. It’s really important we take steps to try and stop the spread. If you or a family member have been sick with norovirus, you should avoid visiting hospitals and care homes, and not return to work or school, until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped.

Hand gels do not kill norovirus, so handwashing with soap and warm water is best. Using bleach-based products to clean surfaces will also help stop the virus from spreading.

The provisional proportion of people in England who had received the 2023 to 2024 influenza vaccine in targeted groups was as follows:

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes atUKHSA, said:

This week’s surveillance indicates a slight increase in COVID-19 infection rates. As we enter the colder months and people begin to mix more indoors, we can expect to see further increases in COVID-19 alongside the usual increases we see in other winter respiratory viruses like flu. We are monitoring rates closely and reminding people that when you have respiratory symptoms you should avoid mixing with others, especially those more vulnerable.

NewUKHSAsurveillance published today shows the autumn 2022 COVID-19 booster prevented around 14,400 people having to be hospitalised. This shows clearly the overwhelming benefits for those most vulnerable in getting their COVID-19 jab as soon as possible this autumn.

It’s reassuring to see that 35.3% of those aged 65 and older have already taken up the offer of a COVID-19 jab.

And our flu campaign this autumn has got off to a great start with vaccination rates across all at-risk groups up on last year.

Heading into winter the flu vaccine offers the best protection against what can be a very severe illness for the more vulnerable, which includes pregnant women as well as 2 and 3 year olds who are all eligible for a free NHS vaccine. Tragically every year we see far too many unvaccinated young children severely ill with flu being hospitalised.

We strongly urge parents and allthose eligible, for either COVID-19 and flu vaccines or both, tobook today with the NHSor via their GP surgery as soon as possible.

The overall positivity for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) increased slightly to 3.3%, with the highest positivity in those aged under 5 years old at 14.9%. Emergency department attendances for acute bronchiolitis increased nationally.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

In this week’s report, we see multiple indicators point to the stabilisation of COVID-19 rates. We have also seen a decrease in hospitalisation in those aged over 75 compared to 2 weeks ago since our last report. While this is good news, we will continue to remain vigilant and monitor rates closely.

TheNHS booking system for the COVID-19 vaccineis now live. We urgeeveryone eligibleto come forward to boost their protection, and to keep the vulnerable around them safe this winter. Vaccination continues to provide the best protection against serious illness and hospitalisation from COVID-19.

I urge everyone who is eligible to come forward and top up their immunity, particularly as we continue to see hospital admissions in people aged 75 years and over who catch the virus.

Thisweekly flu and coronavirus (COVID-19) reportbrings together the latest surveillance data along with the latest public health advice.

Influenza rates continue to be within baseline activity levels.

COVID-19 case rates decreased in week 18 in all age groups, ethnic groups and most regions. Data from Respiratory Datamart suggests that SARS-CoV-2 positivity remained stable at 7.1% compared to 7.2% in the previous week.

Overall, hospital admission rates remained stable in week 18. The highest admission rates continue to be seen in the over 85s, though these have declined again this week. Admission rates among those aged 75 to 84 have declined to 22.49 per 100,000 from 24.10 the previous week, and rates in those aged over 85 have declined to 53.69 per 100,000 from 55.35 the previous week.

The overall COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 18 was 4.42 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 4.63 per 100,000 the previous week.

ICUadmission rates have fallen slightly to 0.14 compared to 0.16 in week 17.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

While cases and hospital admission rates continue to fall, those over the age of 75 remain more vulnerable to severe illness due to COVID-19.

This age group and those aged over 5 with weakened immune systems are now eligible for the spring booster. With the virus still circulating I encourage everyone to take up the offer in order to give themselves the best protection this summer.

Thisweekly flu and coronavirus (COVID-19) reportbrings together the latest surveillance data along with the latest public health advice.

Influenza rates are now within baseline activity levels.

COVID-19 case rates decreased in week 17 in all age groups, regions, and most ethnic groups. Data from Respiratory Datamart suggests that SARS-CoV-2 positivity decreased slightly to 6.9% compared to 7.3% in the previous week. The highest positivity was seen in those aged 65 years and over at 9.8%.

Hospital admission rates have decreased in almost all age groups. The highest admission rates continue to be seen in the over 75s, though these have declined this week. Admission rates among those aged 75 to 84 years have declined to 23.4 per 100,000 from 30.1 the previous week, and those aged over 85 years have declined to 55.4 per 100,000 from at 63.9 the previous week.

The overall COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 17 was 4.5 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 5.4 per 100,000 the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 were highest in the South East, with a rate of 6.8 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

Older people are more vulnerable to COVID-19 and hospital admission rates continue to be highest among the over 75s.

Everyone aged 75 years and over, and those aged 5 years and over with weakened immune systems, are now eligible for thespring booster. Over one million people have come forward since the rollout began in mid-April and, with the virus still circulating, I encourage everyone to take up the offer and give themselves the best protection this summer.

COVID-19 case rates decreased in week 16 in all age groups, regions, and most ethnic groups. Data from Respiratory Datamart suggests that SARS-CoV-2 positivity decreased to 7.6% compared to 7.9% in the previous week. The highest case rates were seen in those 80 years and over at 43.3 per 100,000.

Hospital admission rates have decreased in almost all age groups. The highest admission rates continue to be seen in the over 75s, with those aged 75 to 84 years at 30.4 per 100,000 population and those aged over 85 years at 63.1 per 100,000.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the North East for the ninth consecutive week, with a rate of 7.5 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 9.1 per 100,000 in week 15.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

The highest hospital admission rates for COVID-19 continue to be among the over 75s, so it is important everyone in this age group keeps their immunity topped up by coming forward for theirspring booster.

The virus has not gone away and we continue to see thousands of cases reported every week so topping up your protection is particularly important for groups who are more vulnerable.

Thisweekly flu and coronavirus (COVID-19) briefingbrings together the latest surveillance data along with the latest public health advice.Norovirus surveillance reportsare now published monthly.

COVID-19 case rates decreased in week 15 in all age groups, regions, and most ethnic groups.

TheCOVID-19 spring boosteris now available to all those aged 75 years and over, and those aged 5 years and over with weakened immune systems.

We are continuing to see the highest hospital admission rates for COVID-19 among the over-75s, so it is important everyone in this age group keeps their immunity topped up by booking in for their booster via theNational Booking Serviceor the NHS App.

Sources of surveillance data for influenza, COVID-19 and other respiratory virusesare available on GOV.UK.

Mid-season analysis byUKHSAand partner public health agenciesshows that children and adults vaccinated against flu this year have good protection against the circulating influenza B.

Starting today (13 April), norovirus surveillance reports will be published monthly. The next report will be published on 11 May 2023.

COVID-19 case rates decreased in week 14 in all age groups, regions, and ethnic groups. Data from Respiratory Datamart suggests that SARS-CoV-2 positivity remains stable at 8.9% compared to 9.2% in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates have decreased in almost all age groups. The highest admission rates continue to be seen in the group of those aged 75 years and over, with those aged 75 to 84 years at 34.9 per 100,000 population and those aged 85 years and over at 74.5 per 100,000.

Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, Consultant Epidemiologist for Immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

Those aged 75 years and over are still experiencing the highest hospital admission rates with COVID-19 so it is important everyone in this age group keeps their immunity topped up.

Bookings for thespring booster vaccinationare now open to all those aged 75 and over, as well as those aged 5 years and over with weakened immune systems.

Vaccinations begin on Monday and I would encourage everyone who is eligible to come forward and strengthen their protection. You can book in via theNational Booking Serviceor the NHS app.

The overall flu hospital admission rate decreased in week 14 and is within baseline activity levels. Influenza admission rates declined or stayed low in all age groups.

There were no confirmed influenza outbreaks reported in England.

Swab positivity for flu* remained low and stable** at 1.4% compared to 1.6% the previous week, with the highest positivity seen in the group of those aged 15 to 44 years at 4.7%.

Influenza B continues to make up a majority of detections in surveillance systems.

Most people have some immunity to influenza B so it is typically considered to be milder than influenza A. For those with less immunity – like children who have not encountered flu B before and not been vaccinated against flu – it can be as severe as influenza A.

Mid-season analysis byUKHSAand partner public health agenciesshows that children vaccinated against flu this year have good protection against the circulating influenza B.

In weeks 12 and 13, laboratory reports of norovirus were 68% higher than the 5-season average pre-COVID-19 (2014/2015 to 2018/2019). However, the number of laboratory reports has decreased each week over the 4 week period of weeks 10 to 13 in 2023.

The number of reported enteric virus (EV) outbreaks remained below pre-pandemic levels during weeks 10 to 13, with reports 29% lower than the 5-season average for the same 3-week period prior to the pandemic.

The majority ofEVoutbreaks in weeks 10 and 13 were reported in care home settings.

If anyone is concerned about their symptoms, contact NHS 111, talk to your GP by phone or visit theNHS norovirus webpagefor more information. Please try not to visit healthcare premises if you have symptoms.

Lesley Larkin, Head of Surveillance Scientist for Gastrointestinal Infections and Food Safety Division atUKHSA, said:

We are continuing to see most outbreaks being reported in care homes meaning it’s important to continue to take steps to try and stop norovirus spreading. Norovirus causes vomiting and diarrhoea so if you or a family member are experiencing any of these symptoms, you should avoid visiting hospitals and care homes, and not return to work or school, until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped.

Hand gels do not kill norovirus, so handwashing with soap and warm water is always best. Using bleach-based products to clean surfaces will also help stop the virus from spreading.

Make sure to drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration which can result in hospitalisation; this is particularly important for vulnerable groups such as the very young, elderly or immunocompromised.

COVID-19 case rates decreased in week 13 in most age groups, regions, and ethnic groups. Data from Respiratory Datamart suggests that SARS-CoV-2 positivity has decreased to 9.2% compared to 10.9% in the previous week.

The overall COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 13 was 8.4 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 9.4 per 100,000 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the North East for the sixth consecutive week, with a rate of 12.7 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 14.5 per 100,000 in week 12.

Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, Consultant Epidemiologist for Immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

Those aged 75 and over are still by far the largest group admitted to hospital due to severe illness from COVID-19. With the spring booster now available, I encourage everyone aged over 75, and anyone else who is eligible, to come forward and strengthen their protection by taking up the vaccine as soon as they are offered it.

The overall flu hospital admission rate decreased in week 13 around the threshold between baseline and low activity levels. Influenza admission rates declined or stayed low in all age groups.

Norovirus levels continue to be very high this week with the over 65 age group mostly affected, and the majority of outbreaks reported in care home settings.

Norovirus is very infectious but there are things we can do to stop the spread. Hand gels do not kill norovirus so handwashing with soap and warm water is most effective. If you or your child get the virus you should not return to work (particularly if you work with vulnerable people or food) or send your children back to school until 48 hours after symptoms stop. Using bleach-based products to clean surfaces will also help stop the virus spreading.

Anyone unwell with norovirus should drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration which, for young children and older adults, can result in hospitalisation. Please do take care when visiting hospitals and care homes and wash hands thoroughly with soap and warm water often. Avoid visiting these settings while unwell with norovirus symptoms or until 48 hours after symptoms have stopped.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) activity showed a mixed picture, with some indicators, most notably hospitalisations and primary care surveillance, suggesting a slight increase in activity.

The COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 8 was 9.44 per 100,000 population, an increase from 9.03 per 100,000 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the North East, with a rate of 15.66 per 100,000 population.

In week 9, swab positivity for flu* decreased slightly to 1.8% compared to 2.5% in week 8, with highest positivity seen in the 15 to 44-year-old age group at 4.6%, a decrease from 6.8% in week 8.

We continue to observe a downward trend in COVID-19 cases. Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 have slightly increased, reflecting the higher rates of infection in recent weeks, and remain highest in those aged 85 and over. Flu cases have decreased but we still hope to see further decreases in the coming weeks.

Simple actions can make a big difference in reducing the spread of these viruses. You can help by regularly washing your hands or staying at home and avoiding vulnerable people if you are unwell. If you do have to leave the house, please consider wearing a face covering, which can help prevent you passing respiratory viruses on.

In weeks 7 and 8, laboratory reports of norovirus were 77% higher than the 5-season average pre-COVID-19 (2014/2015 to 2018/2019) with the highest rates of reporting in those over 65 and also in the under 5 age group.

The number of reported enteric virus (EV) outbreaks (all suspected or confirmed as norovirus) remained below pre-pandemic levels during weeks 7 and 8, with reports 31% lower than the 5-season average for the same 2-week period prior to the pandemic.

The majority ofEVoutbreaks in weeks 7 and 8 were reported in care home settings, with the highest number of outbreaks reported this season to date during this period.

If anyone is concerned about their symptoms, contact NHS 111, talk to your GP by phone or visit theNHS norovirus webpagefor more information, but please try not to visit healthcare premises if you have symptoms.

Dr Lesley Larkin, Surveillance Lead, Gastrointestinal Infections and Food Safety Division atUKHSA, said:

Outbreaks of norovirus in educational settings have returned to pre-pandemic levels in recent weeks and are currently more than the 5-season average, particularly affecting children in early years. Norovirus levels continue to be very high and most reported cases are in the over 65s, particularly in care home settings.

Norovirus is very infectious but there are things we can do to stop the spread. Hand gels do not kill norovirus so handwashing with soap and warm water is the best way to prevent the spread. If you or your child get the virus you should not return to work (particularly if you work with vulnerable people or food) or send your children back to school until 48 hours after symptoms stop. Using bleach-based products to clean surfaces will help stop the virus spreading.

Anyone unwell with norovirus should drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration which, for young children, can result in hospitalisation. Please do take care when visiting hospitals and care homes and wash hands thoroughly with soap and warm water often. Do not visit these settings while unwell with norovirus symptoms or until 48 hours after symptoms have stopped.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) activity decreased in most indicators in week 8.

The COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 8 was 8.62 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 9.39 per 100,000 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the North East, with a rate of 15.66 per 100,000 population.

In week 8, swab positivity for flu* remained stable at 2.4% compared to 2.5% in week 7, with the highest positivity seen in those aged 15 to 44 years old at 6.7%, a decrease from 7.6% in week 7.

Hospital admission rates decreased in the last week and have returned to baseline activity levels. Intensive care units (ICU) and high dependency units (HDU) hospital admission rates remained stable and are at baseline range of activity levels**.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

We may be approaching spring, but this latest data shows that viruses that thrive in winter, like flu and COVID-19, are still very much in circulation. Though hospital admission rates for COVID-19 have recently decreased, they remain highest in those aged 85 and over. Flu case rates remain relatively stable and we need to see further decreases in the coming weeks.

Simple actions can make a big difference in reducing the spread of these viruses. You can help by regularly washing your hands or staying at home and avoiding vulnerable people if you are unwell. If you do have to leave the house, please consider wearing a face covering, which can help prevent you passing respiratory viruses on.

In weeks 6 and 7 laboratory reports of norovirus were more than double the 5-season average pre-COVID-19 (2014/2015 to 2018/2019).

The number of reported enteric virus (EV) outbreaks (all suspected or confirmed as norovirus) remained below pre-pandemic levels during weeks 6 and 7, with reports 34% lower than the 5-season average for the same 2-week period prior to the pandemic.

Dr Lesley Larkin, Surveillance Lead, Gastrointestinal Infections and Food Safety (One Health) Division atUKHSA, said:

Norovirus levels are currently the highest we have seen at this time of year in over a decade. Most reported cases are in the over 65s and we’re also seeing an increase in reported outbreaks, particularly in care home settings.

Please stay at home if you are experiencing norovirus symptoms and don’t return to work (particularly if you work with vulnerable people or food) or send sick children to school or nursery until 48 hours after symptoms have cleared. If you have a loved one in a care home or hospital, please avoid visiting until 48 hours after symptoms have cleared.

Regular hand washing is really important to help stop the spread of this bug, but remember, alcohol gels do not kill off norovirus so washing with soap and warm water is best.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) activity increased in most indicators in week 7.

The COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 7 was 9.38 per 100,000 population, an increase from 7.92 per 100,000 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the South East, with a rate of 12.47 per 100,000 population.

In week 7, swab positivity for flu* increased slightly to 2.5% compared to 2.1% in week 6, with the highest positivity seen in those aged 15 to 44 years old at 7.6%, an increase from 5.2% in week 6.

Hospital admission rates increased slightly in the last week and are at low activity levels. Intensive care units (ICU) and high dependency units (HDU) hospital admission rates remained stable and are at baseline range of activity levels**.

Rates of in-person contact (meeting with people from outside of the household) for week 7 of 2023 continue to resemble the rates seen in November to mid-December 2022 (source:UKHSAFluSurvey).

This week, monthly data which covered vaccinations that were given between 1 September and 31 January 2023 for GP patients, frontline healthcare workers and school aged children has been published for the fifth time this season and comparator data is available for previous seasons.

For pregnant women, when grouped by ethnicity, the highest vaccine uptake was seen in the Chinese group, some White (British and Irish) and some Asian (Indian, any other Asian background and mixed White and Asian) groups, with the lowest uptake seen in some Black ethnicities (Caribbean, Mixed White and Black Caribbean, any other Black background).

For primary school-aged children, uptake is comparable at this timepoint in the season to last season, but below that seen in the 2020 to 2021 season (which saw the highest on record for primary school-aged children).

Across a number of surveillance systems, the majority of influenza detections in the most recent week have been influenza B, though still at low levels.

COVID-19 and flu are still in circulation. Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are continuing to increase, particularly among those aged 65 and over. Although flu case rates remain relatively low, we have also seen a rise in hospital admission rates among the over 85s, who are at greater risk of severe illness.

Dr Lesley Larkin, Surveillance Lead, Gastrointestinal Infections and Food Safety (One Health) Division at theUKHSA, said:

Norovirus levels across England are nearly double what we expect to see at this time of year – particularly in those aged 65 and older. It is important that anyone with symptoms avoids visiting loved ones in a care home or hospital while unwell or until 48 hours after symptoms have cleared. This will help stop the spread of the virus to those most vulnerable.

If you or your child has diarrhoea and vomiting, you should stay at home and not return to work or school until you or they have been symptom-free for 48 hours. This is particularly important for those who work with vulnerable people or food.

Regular hand washing is essential to help stop the spread of this bug, but remember, alcohol gels do not kill off norovirus so washing with soap and warm water is best.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

We are still seeing a steady rise in hospital admission rates for coronavirus (COVID-19) and rates remain highest in those over the age of 65, who are more likely to develop serious illness from COVID-19. We therefore cannot afford to be complacent.

It is encouraging that flu levels continue to fall sharply from the rates we saw at the turn of the year, and there are simple actions that we can all continue to take to prevent COVID-19 and flu spreading. If you are unwell, please try to stay at home and don’t visit vulnerable people. If you do have to leave the house, please consider wearing a face covering, which can help prevent you passing respiratory viruses on.

COVID-19 activity shows a mixed picture – with some indicators, most notably hospitalisations, suggesting an increase in activity.

The COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 6 was 7.90 per 100,000 population, a small increase from 7.36 per 100,000 in the previous week.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) hospital admission rates continue to rise, particularly in those aged 65 years and over. The CH.1.1. and XBB.1.5 variants have a growth advantage in the UK, and further increases in transmission and hospitalisations are possible in future weeks.

The autumnCOVID-19 booster offerfor those at higher risk ends this Sunday, as well as the first booster offer for all. Thank you to the millions of people who have come forward for a jab to help protect themselves and others from severe illness and hospitalisation. If you are yet to get a booster that you are eligible for, you shouldbook yours now.

Flu hospital admission rates continue to fall, but we are still in winter and we could still see increases yet. If you are at high risk of developing serious illness from flu, you should book your vaccine soon.

There are simple actions that we can all take to prevent COVID-19 and flu spreading. If you are unwell, please try to stay at home and don’t visit vulnerable people. This will also help to reduce transmission of norovirus, the most common cause of diarrhoea and vomiting, which is on the rise.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist at theUKHSA, said:

The NHS has delivered more than 20 million flu vaccines this winter and this will undoubtedly have spared many thousands from severe illness or hospitalisation and saved countless lives.

While flu levels continue to fall, winter is not over yet and we need to guard against further surges. Vaccine uptake among those aged 2 and 3 years is still well below the past 2 seasons and the number of pregnant women not taking up the offer is also a concern.

Vaccination is our best defence against flu. For pregnant women, it can protect both you and your baby against potentially serious complications, and young children are also vulnerable to serious illness. If you or your children are eligible it’s still not too late to get vaccinated.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) activity shows a mixed picture – with some indicators, most notably hospitalisations and Pillar 2 positivity suggesting a modest increase in activity.

The COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 4 was 6.61 per 100,000 population, a small increase from 5.94 per 100,000 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the South East, with a rate of 8.67 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

It’s concerning that the recent downward trend in COVID-19 hospitalisations has started to show signs of a reverse this week. Older people are still at the highest risk of being hospitalised for COVID-19, so it’s vital those eligible get their autumn/winter booster jab – come forward before Sunday 12 February when the offer comes to an end. It will top up your immunity and keep you protected.

Two variants, CH.1.1 and XBB.1.5, have a growth advantage in the UK and we can expect further increases in transmission and hospitalisations in future weeks.

There are simple actions we can all take to prevent viruses spreading. Washing your hands regularly, catching coughs and sneezes in tissues and if possible letting fresh air into rooms and spaces will all help. If you or your child is unwell please don’t visit vulnerable people, and try to stay at home.

Richard Elson, Head of Risk Assessment and Response, Gastrointestinal Infections and Food Safety (One Health) Division at theUKHSA, said:

Laboratory reports of norovirus are almost a third higher than we would typically see at this time of year, with cases highest in those aged over 65 years. Outbreaks in care homes have also been increasing. It is incredibly important at this time not to visit places with vulnerable people such as hospitals or care homes if you have norovirus symptoms.

One of the best ways to protect yourself against norovirus is by practising good hand hygiene. This includes thorough hand washing with soap and warm water regularly but especially after using the toilet or an episode of illness and before eating or preparing food. Most people will make a full recovery within 2 to 3 days but it is important to drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration, especially in the very young, elderly or those with weakened immune systems.

If you or your child does catch norovirus, you should not go to work (especially if you work with food or vulnerable people), or send your sick children back to school and don’t visit hospitals or care homes until at least 48 hours after symptoms have cleared. Make sure to wash hands and disinfect all surfaces after any episode of illness. Taking these steps will help you stop passing the virus on.

Swab positivity for flu* has decreased to 2.8% in week 3, compared to 6.5% in week 2. The highest positivity is seen in those aged 5 to 14 years and in those aged 15 to 44 years at 4.5%.

Hospital admission rates decreased in the last week and are at low activity levels. Intensive care units (ICU) and high dependency units (HDU) hospital admission rates have also decreased, and approached the baseline range of activity levels**.

Hospital admission rates have decreased across all ages, most notably in adults aged 85 and over (down to 4.9 this week from 26.3 per 100,000 the previous week) and in those aged 75 to 84 years (down to 4.2 this week from 8.5 per 100,000 the previous week). Hospitalisations among children under the age of 5 years are currently the highest among age groups but have decreased (5.4 per 100,000 down from 6.0 last week).

Flu vaccine uptake is comparable to the previous 2021 to 2022 season in a number of cohorts, with 79.2% of those aged 65 years and over having received their flu vaccine, exceeding the World Health Organization target.

For pregnant women, vaccine uptake is 34.3%, and for those under 65 years in a clinical risk group, it is 48.1%.

Vaccine uptake in those aged 2 years and 3 years (41.3% and 43.9% respectively) is below that seen in the previous 2 seasons, but broadly comparable to the 2018 to 2019 pre-pandemic season.

Flu and COVID-19 levels continue to fall but winter is not over yet and we need to guard against further surges. Vaccination is our best defence against flu and COVID-19. Hospital admissions for flu are still highest in the under 5s so if your children are eligible, it’s still not too late to get them vaccinated. Older people are still at the highest risk of being hospitalised for COVID-19, so it’s vital those eligible get their booster jab.

Now is the time to come forward for a COVID-19 booster if you haven’t already – whether it’s your first or if you’re eligible for an autumn booster. Come forward before Sunday 12 February, when the offer comes to an end. It will top up your immunity and keep you and your loved ones protected.

Hospital admissions for COVID-19 remain highest in the oldest age groups, so it’s vital that those eligible continue to come forward for their booster jab.

The pandemic has disrupted the usual seasonal timings of many infections, so we could see flu activity outside the usual winter period - another reason to take up the vaccines now.

There are simple actions we can all take to prevent viruses spreading. Washing your hands regularly, catching coughs and sneezes in tissues and if possible letting fresh air into rooms and spaces will all help. If you or your child is unwell please don’t visit vulnerable people and try to stay at home. If you do have to go out when you’re unwell, consider wearing a face covering can also help prevent you passing viruses on.

*Among people with symptoms tested at sentinel ‘spotter’ laboratories, reported through the Respiratory Datamart surveillance system

Laboratory reports of norovirus were 34% higher than the 5-season average pre-COVID-19 (2014/2015 to 2018/2019).

The number of reported enteric virus (EV) outbreaks remained below pre-pandemic levels during weeks 52 and 1, with reports 58% lower than the 5-season average for the same 2-week period prior to the pandemic.

The majority of outbreaks in weeks 52 and 1 were reported in care home settings.

If anyone is concerned about their symptoms, contact NHS 111 or talk to their GP by phone or visit the NHSnorovirus webpagefor more information.

Dr Lesley Larkin, Surveillance Lead, Gastrointestinal Infections and Food Safety (One Health) Division atUKHSA, said:

Laboratory reports of norovirus have increased in recent weeks and are about a third higher than we would typically see at this time of year. Cases have increased most notably in those aged 65 and over, although we haven’t seen an increase in the number of outbreaks in care homes.

One of the best ways to protect yourself against norovirus is by practising good hand hygiene. This includes thorough hand washing with soap and warm water regularly but especially after using the toilet or an episode of illness and before eating or preparing food. Most people will make a full recovery within 1 to 2 days but it is important to drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration, especially in the very young, elderly or those with weakened immune systems.

If you do catch norovirus, do not go to work (especially if you work with food or vulnerable people), send children back to school or visit hospitals or care homes until at least 48 hours after symptoms have cleared. Make sure to wash hands and disinfect all surfaces after any episode of illness. Taking these steps will help you stop passing the virus on.

Swab positivity for flu* has decreased to 12.2% in week 1, compared to 25.2% in week 52. The highest positivity is seen in 5 to 14-year-olds at 17.0%.

Hospital admission rates and intensive care admission rates have decreased in the last week. Hospital admission rates have decreased and intensive care activity decreased this week but remained at medium activity levels**.

Admission rates have decreased in adults aged 85 and over (down to 46.5 this week from 70.9 per 100,000 the previous week) and those aged 75 to 84 (down to 23.7 this week from 40.0 per 100,000 the previous week). Hospitalisations among children under the age of 5 also remain high but have decreased (14.0 per 100,000 down from 21.6 last week).

Flu vaccine uptake is comparable to the previous 2021 to 2022 season in a number of cohorts, with 78.7% of 65-year-olds and over having received their flu vaccine, exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) target.

For pregnant women, vaccine uptake is 33.6%, and for those under 65 years in a clinical risk group, it is 46.7%.

Vaccine uptake in 2 and 3-year-olds (40.4% and 42.9% respectively) is below that seen in the previous 2 seasons, but broadly comparable to the 2018 to 2019 pre-pandemic season.

Rates of in-person contact (meeting with people from outside of the household) for week 1 of 2023 were comparable to those of week 52 2022, and have not returned to the levels seen in November to mid-December (source: UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) FluSurvey).UKHSAcontinues to monitor flu signal as more people return to work and school.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

Delivering more than 20 million flu vaccines is an important milestone and this will undoubtedly have spared many thousands from severe illness or hospitalisation and saved countless lives.

Flu continues to be a serious health threat this winter. If you or your children are eligible it’s still not too late to get vaccinated, to protect yourselves and those around you – and help reduce NHS pressures.

Flu vaccination gives vital protection, but there are other simple actions we can all take to prevent viruses spreading. Washing your hands regularly, catching coughs and sneezes in tissues and if possible letting fresh air into rooms and spaces will all help. If you are unwell please don’t visit vulnerable people and try to stay at home. If you do have to go out when you’re unwell, wearing a face covering can also help prevent you passing viruses on.

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in most indicators in week 1 of 2023 compared to week 52 of 2022.

The COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 1 was 9.08 per 100,000 population, a small decrease from 10.76 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the North East, with a rate of 13.18 per 100,000 population.

Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, Consultant Epidemiologist for Immunisation and Countermeasures atUKHSA, said:

These early signs that COVID-19 infection levels may be in decline are encouraging and welcome, but we cannot be complacent. Today’s data shows we’re heading in the right direction but COVID-19 is still circulating at high levels and hospital admissions remain high in the oldest age groups (117.3 in those 85s and over), so it is particularly important that everyone who is eligible continues to come forward to accept their booster jab.

While COVID-19 is a mild illness for many, we must not forget that it can cause severe illness or even death for those most vulnerable in our communities. COVID-19 is still circulating at high levels, so do take up your vaccine if you are offered it.

Following some simple steps can help keep us safe from different winter illnesses in circulation. If you are unwell this winter, please try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people, particularly elderly or vulnerable people  – this will help stop infection from spreading. If you are unwell but have to go out, please consider wearing a face covering and practise good hand hygiene to limit spread.

Due to reporting delays and bank holidays over Christmas and New Year, findings should be interpreted with caution.

Swab positivity for flu* has decreased in week 52 compared to week 51 and is now at 23.6%; it is highest in 15 to 44-year-olds at 31.0%. However, the figure for week 52 remains higher than week 50.

Hospital admission rates and intensive care admission rates increased further in recent weeks. Hospital admissions increased in week 51 to very high activity levels. The rate in week 52 was in the medium activity range. Intensive care activity increased in week 51 before decreasing slightly in week 52 remaining within medium activity levels**.

Admission rates have increased in adults aged 85 and over (61.8 in week 52 and 66.2 per 100,000 in week 51 compared with 46.9 in week 50) and those aged 75 to 84 (31.8 in week 52 and 49.9 per 100,000 in week 51 from 24.8 in week 50).

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, coronavirus (COVID-19) activity has decreased across all indicators in week 52 of 2022 compared to week 51.

The COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 52 was 10.71 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 11.79 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the South East, with a rate of 14.29 per 100,000 population.

The COVID-19 autumn booster vaccination campaign commenced in early September. By the end of week 52, 64.1% of all people aged over 50 years old had been vaccinated with an autumn booster dose

Dame Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

In the week leading up to Christmas, we saw a dramatic increase in the number of people admitted to hospital with flu, with the highest levels of hospital admissions we’ve seen in at least a decade. Admissions were particularly high in the under 5s and those 65 and over.

I urge all those eligible to come forward for their free flu vaccination, which is the best way to protect yourself from serious illness. Uptake of the flu vaccine is particularly low in children aged  2 and 3 so if your child is eligible please urgently take up the offer.

COVID-19 also continues to circulate at high levels and anyone eligible for a booster who has yet to take it up should come forward.

Frequent handwashing with soap and warm water, catching coughs and sneezes in tissues and keeping your home well ventilated can also help stop viruses from spreading.

Try to stay home when unwell and if you do have to go out, wearing a face covering can help prevent germs spreading to other people. Don’t visit vulnerable people if you’re unwell.

RSVoverall swab positivity* decreased to 5.9% with positivity in under 5-year-olds at 13.5%. Decreases in positivity were seen in all age groups.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

RSVcan be most severe for children under 2 – and particularly nasty for babies and those born prematurely. Please carry on with good hygiene habits to protect yourself and others from common seasonal illnesses. This means washing your hands regularly, using a tissue to catch coughs or sneezes and washing your hands afterwards, and staying away from others if you feel unwell.

If you are concerned your child has cold symptoms with unusual breathing or has trouble feeding, please contact your GP or NHS 111. If your child seems seriously ill, trust your judgement and get emergency care.

Swab positivity for flu* has increased further and is now at 26.4%; it remains highest in 5 to 14-year-olds at 40.1%.

Hospital admission rates and intensive care admission rates have increased further in the last week. Hospital admissions have continued to increase sharply within the medium band and intensive care activity remains at medium activity levels**.

Admission rates have increased significantly in adults aged 85 and over (up to 42.04 this week from 25.40 per 100,000 the previous week) and those aged 75 to 84 (up to 19.00 this week from 11.81 per 100,000 the previous week).

Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

Hospitalisations have increased dramatically in those aged 75 and over in the past week, with admissions among children under 5 remaining high.ICUadmissions have also increased this week.

NHS services are already under pressure so it’s more important than ever to get protected with the flu vaccine and help keep yourself out of hospital.

Most children aged 2 and 3 can get a nasal spray flu vaccine through their GP surgery. If you are pregnant or in a clinical risk group, you are also at greater risk, so it is even more important you take up the offer. Anyone over 50 can get a free flu or COVID-19 booster vaccine which can bebooked online.

We can all take actions to stop flu and other infections spreading, if you feel unwell try to stay home, and if you have to go out – wear a face covering in enclosed spaces. Wash your hands regularly and try to keep rooms well ventilated.

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has increased across all indicators in week 50 of 2022.

The COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 50 was 9.56 per 100,000 population, an increase from 6.61 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the South West, with a rate of 15.21 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes atUKHSA, said:

We are seeing a rise in cases and hospital admissions for both flu and COVID-19 as people continue to mix indoors this winter. Hospitalisation rates due to COVID-19 remain highest in those aged 65 and over, so it is vital that everyone who is eligible continues to come forward to accept their booster jab before the end of the year.

Both COVID-19 and flu can cause severe illness or even death for those most vulnerable in our communities, and so it is also important to avoid contact with other people if you are unwell in order to help stop infections spreading over the Christmas and new year period.

Norovirus is passed on by close contact with people with the infection, eating food contaminated with the virus or by touching surfaces where the virus has landed. Alcohol gels do not kill norovirus, so help stop the spread by washing your hands with soap and warm water after using the toilet and before preparing food. Make sure to wash hands and disinfect all surfaces after any episode of illness.

Flu is now circulating widely and we have seen a sharp rise in the rate of hospitalisations for flu this week, particularly among the under 5s and over 85s.

Admissions are now at the highest point since the 2017 to 2018 season and we are expecting case numbers to continue increasing as we move further into winter.

The flu vaccine offers the best protection against severe illness and it’s not too late for everyone eligible to get it. Uptake is particularly low in those aged 2 and 3 so if your child is eligible please take up the offer.

COVID-19 activity showed a mixed picture in week 49 – with some surveillance indicators, most notably hospitalisations and care home outbreaks, suggesting a modest increase in activity.

The COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 49 was 6.61 per 100,000 population, a small increase from 5.36 in the previous week.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

With winter now upon us, we are seeing flu circulating more widely. The NHS frontline has already delivered millions of vaccines to those most at risk from what can be a deadly virus. With Christmas fast approaching, if you are eligible and have not yet been vaccinated, it can take a fortnight or so for the flu vaccine to provide protection.

Nobody wants to see their loved ones be sick or in hospital with flu over Christmas, so to ensure your family are ready to enjoy the festive season together don’t hesitate and book your vaccine today.

Parents of children in eligible school years should make sure their kids take up the offer of flu nasal spray vaccine at the school session or in community catch-up clinics.

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in some indicators but was stable or increased slightly in others in week 48 of 2022.

The COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 48 was 5.45 per 100,000 population, a small increase from 4.51 in the previous week.

Dr Lesley Larkin, Surveillance Lead, Gastrointestinal Infections and Food Safety (One Health) Division atUKHSA, said:

Norovirus is passed on by close contact with people with the infection, eating food contaminated with the virus or by touching surfaces where the virus has landed. Alcohol gels do not kill norovirus, so help stop the spread by washing your hands with soap and warm water after using the toilet and before preparing food. Make sure to wash hands and disinfect all surfaces after any episode of illness.

If you do catch norovirus, do not return to work (especially if you work with food or vulnerable people), send children back to school or visit hospitals or care homes until at least 48 hours after symptoms have cleared. This will help you stop passing the virus on.

Swab positivity for flu* has increased further and is now at 10.5%; it remains highest in 5 to 14-year-olds at 18.5%.

Hospital admission rates and intensive care admission rates have increased further in the last week, admissions are now at medium activity levels and intensive care activity has increased within the medium band**.

The highest rates of admission are being seen in children under the age of 5 (6.88 per 100,000) and adults aged 85 and over (6.94 per 100,000).

Flu vaccine uptake is comparable to the previous 2021 to 2022 season in a number of cohorts, with more than 75% of over 65-year-olds having received their flu vaccine, exceeding the World Health Organization target.

For pregnant women, vaccine uptake is 29.3%, just over 5 percentage points lower than this time last season, and around 3 percentage points lower than 2 seasons ago.

Vaccine uptake in 2 and 3-year-olds is below that seen in the previous 2 seasons. It is just over 9.5 percentage points lower than last season and a little over 14 percentage points lower than 2020 to 2021, but broadly comparable to the 2018 to 2019 pre-pandemic season.

*The percentage of people who test positive among those with symptoms tested at sentinel ‘spotter’ laboratories, reported through the Respiratory Datamart surveillance system.

**Influenza activity bandsare set using an international standard method.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

Flu vaccine uptake among pregnant women and young children is low for this time of year. This is concerning given the expected reduced levels of natural immunity across the population following 2 winters with little flu.

Getting the vaccine when you are pregnant can protect you and your baby against potentially serious complications.

It can take a couple of weeks to build up full immunity after the vaccine so it is important to book yours as soon as possible to get protected in time for the festive season.

Parents of children in eligible school years should make sure their kids take up the offer of flu nasal spray vaccine at the school session or in community catch-up clinics.

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in most indicators in week 47 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) in care homes due to COVID-19 increased in England in week 47 to 83 compared to 49 in the previous week.

The COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 47 was 4.69 per 100,000 population, a small increase from 4.45 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the East Midlands, with a rate of 6.07 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes atUKHSA, said:

As we head into the coldest part of the year, we would expect to see the prevalence of COVID-19 and other winter viruses begin to increase as people mix more indoors. This is what the data is beginning to show. COVID-19 hospitalisations are highest in the oldest age groups, so it is particularly important that everyone who is eligible comes forward to receive their booster jab.

While COVID-19 and flu can be mild infections for many, we must not forget that they can cause severe illness or even death for those most vulnerable in our communities.

If you are unwell this winter, please try to stay at home and avoid contact with vulnerable people – this will help stop infections spreading.

RSVoverall swab positivity* increased to 12.7% in week 47, with the highest positivity in under 5-year-olds remaining elevated at 34.4%.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

Over recent weeksRSVrates have been rising across all age groups, most notably in the under 5s.RSVis unfortunately common at this time of the year and can be severe for children under 2 – particularly for babies and those born prematurely. Everyone should try and avoid spreading respiratory viruses to young children – use tissues, wash hands and avoid visiting babies if you are unwell.

If you are worried your child has cold symptoms with unusual breathing or trouble feeding, please contact your GP or NHS 111. If your child seems seriously ill, trust your judgement and get emergency care.

Laboratory reports of norovirus have remained stable in recent weeks and were 32% lower in weeks 45 and 46 than the 5-season average pre-COVID-19 (2014/2015 to 2018/2019).

The number of reported enteric virus (EV) outbreaks remained below pre-pandemic levels during weeks 45 and 46 with reports 63% lower than the 5-season average for the same 2-week period prior to the pandemic.

OverallEVoutbreaks in care homes and hospitals remain notably lower than during the same period in the 5 seasons pre-COVID-19.

Swab positivity for flu* has increased slightly and is now at 8.2%; it is highest in 5 to 14-year-olds at 18%, followed by 15 to 44-year-olds at 15.8%.

Hospital admission rates and intensive care admission rates have increased notably in the last week, to medium activity levels for intensive care and just below the medium activity threshold for admissions.

Flu vaccine uptake is comparable to the previous 2021 to 2022 season in a number of cohorts, but notably primary school children exceed previous records – with uptake numbers over 21% (receiving the nasal spray vaccine) between 1 September and 31 October. This is up 7% on the previous year and up to 3% higher than the previous record year (2018 to 2019).

More than 7 out of 10 over 65-year-olds have also received their flu vaccine.

*The percentage of people who test positive among those with symptoms tested at sentinel ‘spotter’ laboratories, reported through the Respiratory Datamart surveillance system.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

It’s encouraging to see record rates of primary school children getting their nasal spray flu vaccine so far this year with over 21% vaccinated by the end of October. Last week, 5 to 14-year-olds were the age most likely to test positive for flu so it’s still important for parents to ensure their children get the vaccine for the best protection. It will also help stop the spread to other more vulnerable family members, especially grandparents, very young children or those with health conditions. If you’ve missed the school vaccination appointment then there are NHS community clinics available.

It’s also great to see that more than 7 out of 10 over 65-year-olds have had their flu vaccine, ensuring they have the best protection as we head into winter. If you haven’t had your flu or COVID-19 vaccine and are over 50, pregnant or have a long term health condition there is still time, so make sure you book an appointment as soon as you can.

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in most indicators in week 46 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) decreased in England in week 46 to 122 compared to 123 in the previous week.

The COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 46 was 4.38 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 5.07 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the South East, with a rate of 5.48 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes atUKHSA, said:

The continued decline in COVID-19 cases across the country is reassuring. Declining hospitalisations in over 50s is also a result of so many people having come forward for their booster. We urge those who have not had their booster this autumn to do so as soon as possible. Vaccination remains the best way to protect yourself, your family and the NHS, particularly as we head into winter.

RSVoverall swab positivity* increased to 11.7% in week 46, with the highest positivity in under 5-year-olds remaining elevated at 33.2%.

As is typical for this time of the year,RSVrates continue to rise across all ages, with the highest rates of detection and hospitalisations in under 5s. For children under 2,RSVcan be severe – particularly for babies and those born prematurely. Use a tissue to catch coughs and sneezes and always wash your hands afterwards.

Never smoke near a baby and avoid visiting babies if you are ill. If you are worried your child has cold symptoms with any unusual breathing or trouble feeding, please contact your GP or NHS 111. If your child seems seriously ill, trust your judgement and get emergency care.

Hospitalisation rates remain stable overall but have increased in the under 5s and 75 and over age groups compared with the previous week. Rates are highest in the 85 and over age group at 3.87 admissions per 100,000 people, with the under 5s (2.96 per 100,000) and 75 to 84-year-olds (2.95 per 100,000) close behind. Hospital admission rates and intensive care admission rates remain stable overall at slightly above what would be expected for this time of year (baseline).

Vaccine uptake for flu is comparable to the previous 2021 to 2022 season in a number of cohorts: those aged 65 and over (71.9%), those under 65 years in clinical risk groups (37.2%) and for pregnant women (25.9%). Uptake is lower however in those aged 2 and 3 years old (27.9% and 29.7% respectively).

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

Children under 5 continue to be hospitalised with flu this autumn. Children aged 2 and 3 can be protected by an NHS flu vaccine, but the numbers getting what is a straightforward nasal spray vaccine are still low – less than 30%. As we go into winter we expect flu levels to increase. Nobody wants their child to get sick. I strongly urge parents to book with their local GP nurse as soon as possible.

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in most indicators in week 45 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) decreased in England in week 45 to 123 compared to 140 in the previous week.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist for the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

We’re now seeing flu spreading in all age groups over recent weeks. Children aged 2 to 3 may have little natural immunity to flu and can become severely ill. The recent flu season in Australia saw a high number of children hospitalised and there have already been intensive care admissions of young children in the UK. That is why we are urging parents to get their children vaccinated as soon as possible.

It is also important that schoolchildren get vaccinated as it not only protects them but also reduces the spread of flu. Again, parents should ensure they fill in the school consent form so their child is able to get the nasal spray through their school programme.

Richard Elson, Principal Epidemiologist,UKHSA, said:

We are starting to see a rise in norovirus outbreaks in care homes. Help stop norovirus spreading in this vulnerable group by avoiding visits if you are unwell.

It is important to remember, alcohol gels don’t kill norovirus. The best way to protect yourself and others is to wash your hands with soap and warm water regularly and thoroughly, especially after illness or after using the toilet and before handling food.

If you are unlucky enough to become ill from the virus, drink plenty of fluids and don’t return to work or send sick children to school until at least 48 hours after symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting have stopped. This is particularly important if you work with food or with people who are very young or very old.

Positivity for flu has continued to increase and is now at 5.2%. It is the highest in 5 to 14-year-olds at 12% followed by 15 to 44-year-olds at 9.6%.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist for the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

Hospital admission rates for flu have increased in recent weeks and remain highest in those under 5. Already this year a small number of young children have needed intensive care. Please book your pre-schooler in for flu vaccine at your GP surgery as soon as you can.

Flu nasal spray vaccine is also currently being offered to all primary school children and will be available for some secondary school years later this season.

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, coronavirus (COVID-19) activity has decreased in most indicators in week 42 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) decreased in England in week 42 to 280 compared to 347 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the South West, with a rate of 14.08 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes atUKHSA, said:

The ongoing drop in COVID-19 cases and hospitalisation rates is a testament to the continued success of the autumn booster programme and it is hugely encouraging that 10 million people in England have already taken up their booster. However, it is vital that we do not become complacent as cases could rise quickly again throughout the winter and we need to be ready. Please come forward for your booster as soon as it is offered to you.

Vaccines remain our best protection against disease but it’s also important that we all remain cautious as we head into winter. If you have symptoms of a respiratory infection, it is important to avoid contact with elderly people or those who have underlying health conditions. This will not only help to keep you and your loved ones safe, but will go a long way to relieving the pressure on the NHS through the winter.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in most indicators in week 41 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) decreased in England in week 41 to 347 compared to 370 in the previous week.

Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases for week 41 was 11.0 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 13.9 in the previous week.

The COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 41 was 11.75 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 12.53 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the South West, with a rate of 15.96 per 100,000 population.

Cases of flu have climbed quickly in the past week, indicating that the season has begun earlier than normal. We are seeing hospitalisations andICUadmissions rising the fastest in children under 5.

Vaccination for flu is currently behind last season for pre-schoolers (12.1% in all 2 year olds and 12.8% in all 3 year olds) and pregnant women (12.4%) and under 65 in a clinical risk group (18.2%). This is compared to 17.4% in 2 year olds, 18.6% in 3 year olds, 15.7% in pregnant women and 20.7% in under 65s and in clinical risk groups last year.

Around 33 million people are eligible for the flu vaccine and 26 million people are eligible for the COVID-19 booster. Getting vaccinated is not just about protecting yourself but others around you, especially the more vulnerable groups.

Information on eligibilityfor the flu vaccine and COVID-19 booster is available.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency, said:

Our latest data shows early signs of the anticipated threat we expected to face from flu this season. We’re urging parents in particular not to be caught out as rates of hospitalisations andICUadmissions are currently rising fastest in children under 5. This will be a concern for many parents and carers of young children, and we urge them to take up the offer of vaccination for eligible children as soon as possible.

It’s possible that we’re already seeing the benefits from so many people taking up their COVID-19 autumn booster in England. Encouragingly, the latest data shows a small decrease in COVID-19 cases and hospitalisation rates over the past week. There’s no room for complacency though, as cases could rise again at any point and we need to be armed in readiness through vaccination of everyone who’s eligible. Don’t delay; please come forward for both COVID-19 and flu vaccinations as soon as you’re offered them.

Vaccines remain our best protection against severe disease and hospitalisation this winter but it’s also vital that we all remain cautious as we head into winter when people tend to mix more indoors and the risk increases. If you are feeling unwell, avoid contact with elderly people or those with underlying health conditions.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has increased in most indicators in week 40 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) increased in England in week 40 to 370 compared to 270 in the previous week.

Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 40 was 12.1 per 100,000 population, an increase from 11.7 in the previous week.

The hospital admission rate for week 40 was 12.60 per 100,000 population, an increase from 10.65 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the North East, with a rate of 15.84 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

We’re seeing sustained increases in COVID-19 cases and hospitalisation rates so we continue to urge those eligible for vaccinations to come forward, whether that’s a first dose or a booster. Vaccines are the best protection against severe disease and hospitalisation this winter and it’s never too late to take up your first dose. It’s fantastic to see that around 30% of those eligible have already come forward for their booster in such a short period of time.

There are early indications that deaths with COVID-19 have also started to rise. While this is concerning, it is too early to say whether these are deaths due to COVID-19 and it is reassuring that at this stage there is no overall excess mortality.

If you are unwell or have symptoms of a respiratory infection, it is particularly important to avoid contact with elderly people or those who are more likely to have severe disease because of their ongoing health conditions.

Wearing a face covering will also help stop respiratory infections spreading.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has increased in most indicators in week 39 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) increased in England in week 39 to 273 compared to 170 in the previous week; a 61% increase in suspected outbreaks.

Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 39 was 9.2 per 100,000 population, a 10% increase compared to the previous week.

The hospital admission rate for week 39 was 10.83 per 100,000 population, a 45% increase compared to the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the South West, with a rate of 16.67 per 100,000 population. This represents a 250% increase in the South West since mid-September, when there was a rate of 4.79 per 100,000 population.

Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

This week’s data shows concerning further increases in COVID-19 cases and hospitalisation rates, which are now at their highest level in months. Outbreaks in hospitals and care homes are also on the rise.

Make sure you have any COVID-19 vaccinations you are eligible for and avoid contact with others if you feel unwell or have symptoms of a respiratory infection.

If you are unwell, it is particularly important to avoid contact with elderly people or those who are more likely to have severe disease because of their ongoing health conditions.

If you have symptoms of a respiratory infection, wearing a face covering will also help stop infections spreading.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has increased in most indicators in week 38 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) increased in England in week 38 to 170 compared to 133 in the previous week.

Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 38 was 6.9 per 100,000 population, an increase from 5.5 in the previous week. There was a large increase in those aged over 80.

The hospital admission rate for week 38 was 7.62 per 100,000 population, an increase from 4.96 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the North East, with a rate of 10.82 per 100,000 population

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

It is clear now that we are seeing an increase which could signal the start of the anticipated winter wave of COVID-19 – so the time to boost your protection with a vaccine if you’re eligible is now. Cases have started to climb and hospitalisations are increasing in the oldest age groups.

In the coming weeks, we expect a double threat of low immunity and widely circulating flu and COVID-19, creating an unpredictable winter and additional pressure on health services. While COVID-19 and flu can be mild infections for many, we must not forget that they can cause severe illness or even death for those most vulnerable in our communities.

If you are unwell this winter, please try to stay at home and avoid contact with vulnerable people – this will help stop infections spreading.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has remained stable in most indicators in week 37 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) increased in England in week 37 to 133 compared to 131 in the previous week.

Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 37 was 4.6 per 100,000 population, a slight decrease from 5.1 in the previous week. There were small increases in those aged over 80.

The hospital admission rate for week 37 was 4.91 per 100,000 population, a slight decrease from 5.94 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the North East, with a rate of 7.19 per 100,000 population.

Our latest data, available through theCOVID-19 dashboard, is updated weekly on Thursdays at around 4pm and is the focus of the below quote.

Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor at the UK Health Security Agency, said:

While COVID-19 rates are still low, the latest data for the last 7 days indicate a rise in hospitalisations and a rise in positive tests reported from the community.

For those eligible, the time to get your autumn booster is now. Getting a booster will give your immune system time to build up your protection against being severely ill from COVID-19 as we move into winter.

All of the available boosters provide good protection against severe illness from COVID-19 and getting your booster sooner rather than later is crucial.

As it gets colder and we head towards winter, we will start to see respiratory infections pick up – please try to stay at home if you are unwell and avoid contact with vulnerable people.

The latestnational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reporthas been published.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in most indicators in week 35 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) increased in England in week 35 to 116 compared to 111 in the previous week.

Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 35 was 3.7 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 4.1 in the previous week.

The hospital admission rate for week 35 was 5.33 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 6.17 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the North East, with a rate of 6.71 per 100,000 population.

Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, consultant epidemiologist for immunisation and countermeasures at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

The latest COVID-19 indicators provide more positive news, as COVID-19 case rates and hospitalisations continue to decline.

However, with respiratory viruses increasing in circulation in the winter months we can expect to see growing cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. We urge all who are contacted to come forward and accept their booster when called for their jab. The NHS booking system is now open for immunosuppressed people and those aged over 75.

We also encourage everyone to keep helping to reduce the spread of the virus – meeting in well-ventilated spaces, washing hands regularly and staying away from others where possible if you have symptoms of a respiratory illness.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in most indicators in week 34 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) decreased in England in week 34 to 111 compared to 124 in the previous week.

Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 34 was 3.8 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 5.1 in the previous week.

The hospital admission rate for week 34 was 5.88 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 7.17 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the West Midlands, with a rate of 8.23 per 100,000 population.

Thelatest evidenceshows that vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation is similar for the BA.4/5 variants as it is for BA.2.

​In somebody who received their second dose around 6 months previously, a booster dose increases protection against hospitalisation by 50 to 60%. This is the most comprehensive analysis of vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation for BA.4/5 undertaken to date.

Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, consultant epidemiologist for immunisation and countermeasures at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

The latest COVID-19 indicators provide more positive news, with continued low levels of COVID-19 case rates and hospitalisations and a sustained downward trend.

The latest evidence shows vaccine effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against hospitalisation with the BA.4 and BA.5 variant is similar to the protection given for BA.2. The latest analysis shows getting a booster dose 6 or more months after your first 2 jabs increases protection against hospitalisation by around 60%.

The autumn booster will provide the best protection against COVID-19 this winter and we urge all those eligible – people aged 50 and over and those with underlying health conditions – to come forward when called for their jab.

We also encourage everyone to keep up the actions that are helping to reduce the spread of the virus – meeting in well-ventilated spaces, washing hands regularly and staying away from others where possible if you have symptoms of a respiratory illness.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in most indicators in week 33 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) decreased in England in week 33 to 124 compared to 172 in the previous week.

Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 33 was 4.7 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 5.9 in the previous week.

The hospital admission rate for week 33 was 7.35 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 8.90 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 remain highest in the North East, with a rate of 9.67 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Clinical Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

COVID-19 case rates and hospitalisations are at low levels and continue on a downward trend.

The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines significantly reduces the risk of being seriously ill with the virus. When the autumn booster is rolled out in a few weeks’ time we urge all those eligible – people aged 50 and over and those with underlying health conditions – to come forward for their jab.

We also encourage everyone to keep up the actions that are helping to reduce the spread of the virus – meeting in well-ventilated spaces, washing hands regularly and staying away from others where possible if you have symptoms of a respiratory illness.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in most indicators in week 32 of 2022.

The hospital admission rate for week 32 was 9.8 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 10.12 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the North East, with a rate of 13.42 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Clinical Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

It’s very encouraging that COVID-19 case rates and hospitalisation are now at low levels. We expect them to remain low over the coming weeks before rising again as we head into the autumn and winter.

COVID-19 vaccines continue to provide the best defence against serious illness and hospitalisation with COVID-19. Plans are well under way for the roll-out of the autumn booster programme and we urge all those eligible – people aged 50 and over and those with underlying health conditions – to come forward when called to have the maximum protection against COVID-19.

We also encourage everyone to keep up the actions that are helping to reduce the spread of the virus – meeting in well-ventilated spaces, washing hands regularly and staying away from others where possible if you have symptoms of a respiratory illness.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 remain highest in the West Midlands, with a rate of 15.13 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Clinical Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

COVID-19 case rates, hospitalisations andICUadmissions have continued to decline this week, in order to drive down the virus further we urge eligible people to keep coming forward for their vaccine.

Vaccination remains the best form of defence against hospitalisation and serious illness.

Meeting up outdoors or in well ventilated spaces where possible, observing good hand hygiene and covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing will continue to help reduce the spread of COVID-19.

Don’t forget that if you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection, and a high temperature or feel unwell, try to stay at home or away from others – especially elderly or vulnerable people.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in several indicators in week 30 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) decreased in England to 271 in week 30, compared to 416 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 highest in the West Midlands, with a rate of 17.49 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Clinical Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

While COVID-19 case rates, hospitalisations andICUadmissions continue to show positive signs of decline we urge eligible people to keep coming forward for their vaccine.

Vaccination remains the best form of defence against hospitalisation and serious illness with the virus.

It’s also important to keep remembering the simple steps that will help to reduce the spread of COVID-19 – meet up outdoors or in well ventilated spaces where possible, observe good hand hygiene and cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.

Don’t forget that if you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection, and a high temperature or feel unwell, try to stay at home or away from others – especially elderly or vulnerable people.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 remain highest in the North East, with a rate of 20.19 per 100,000 population.

Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, Deputy Director of Public Health Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

We are now seeing decreases in COVID-19 case rates and hospitalisations. While this is encouraging, COVID-19 has not gone away and we really want to see further declines in the coming weeks and months. People aged 75 and over remain at particular risk of severe disease if they are not up to date with their vaccinations.

We urge anyone who is not up to date with their jabs to come forward to give themselves the best possible protection.

To help prevent the spread of COVID-19, try to meet up outdoors or in well ventilated spaces and remember to keep up good hand hygiene and cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing. It is also sensible to wear a face covering if you are in crowded, enclosed spaces.

If you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection, and a high temperature or feel unwell, try to stay at home or away from others – especially elderly or vulnerable people.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has increased slightly in several indicators in week 28 of 2022.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 remain highest in the West Midlands, with a rate of 25.33 per 100,000 population.

Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, Deputy Director of Public Health Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

The increase in COVID-19 case rates and hospitalisations continues to show signs of slowing but there is no room to be complacent and people aged 75 and over remain at particular risk of severe disease if they are not up to date with their vaccinations.

We urge all those who are eligible for a booster to take up the offer as soon as possible. Anyone who has not yet had their first or second dose, should also get up to date with their jabs to give themselves the best possible protection.

To help prevent the spread of COVID-19, try to meet up outdoors or in well ventilated spaces and remember to keep up good hand hygiene and cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing. It is also sensible to wear a face covering if you are in crowded, enclosed spaces.

If you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection, and a high temperature or feel unwell, try to stay at home or away from others – especially elderly or vulnerable people.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has increased in several indicators in week 27 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) increased in England to 537 in week 27, compared to 504 in the previous week.

Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 27 was 9.4 per 100,000 population, a slight increase from 9.3 in the previous week.

The hospital admission rate for week 27 was 17.90 per 100,000 population, an increase from 15.74 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 remain highest in the West Midlands, with a rate of 24.45 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Clinical Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

COVID-19 case rates and hospitalisations continue to rise, although the rate of increase appears to be slowing. Those aged 75 and over who have not taken up the offer of the spring booster put themselves at risk of severe disease.

We urge all those who are eligible for the spring booster to take up the offer as soon as possible. Anyone who has not yet had their first or second dose, should also get up to date with their jabs to give themselves the best possible protection.

To help prevent the spread of COVID-19, try to meet up outdoors or in well ventilated spaces and remember to keep up good hand hygiene and cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 remain highest in the West Midlands, with a rate of 16.97 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Clinical Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

We continue to see COVID-19 case rates and hospitalisations rise in all age groups, with the largest increases in hospitalisations andICUadmissions in those aged 75 and older.

There is likely to be a substantial amount of waning immunity in older people who have not taken up the booster on schedule, so we can expect these rises to continue over the coming weeks and throughout July.

It’s reassuring that 79.8 per cent of people aged 75 and over in June have had a vaccine in the past 6 months but we urge the remaining 16 per cent to get their spring booster as soon as possible to help protect against serious illness – preliminary analysis shows that the vaccine is continuing to protect against severe illness and remains the best defence against severe disease and hospitalisation. This includes anyone who had their last vaccine more than 6 months ago, as well as those living in care homes or who are clinically vulnerable.

Vaccination remains the best defence against severe disease and we urge anyone who’s eligible for the spring booster to take it up. Remember that COVID-19 has not gone away and we should all keep up good hand and respiratory hygiene.

It is also sensible to wear a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces. If you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection, and a high temperature or feel unwell, try to stay at home or away from others – especially elderly or vulnerable people.

The hospital admission rate for week 25 was 11.11 per 100,000 population, an increase from 7.98 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 remain highest in the North West, with a rate of 15.09 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Clinical Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

We continue to see an increase in COVID-19 data, with a rise in case rates and hospitalisations in those aged 65 years and over, and outbreaks in care homes.

We can also now see a rise inICUadmissions in older age groups.

It’s reassuring that 83.5 per cent of people aged 75 and over have had a vaccine in the past 6 months but we urge the remaining 16.5% per cent, as well as those living in care homes or who are clinically vulnerable, to get their spring booster for protection against serious illness. Vaccination remains the best defence against severe disease and hospitalisation.

COVID-19 has not gone away and we should all remember to keep up good hand and respiratory hygiene. It is also sensible to wear a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces.

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has increased in several indicators in week 24 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) increased in England to 261 in week 24, compared to 170 in the previous week.

Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 24 was 4.2 per 100,000 population, a slight increase from 3.9 in the previous week.

The hospital admission rate for week 24 was 8.20 per 100,000 population, an increase from 6.11 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 remain highest in the North East, with a rate of 12.45 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Clinical Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

We continue to see increases in COVID-19 outbreaks within care homes and hospitalisations among those aged 75 years and over.

Our data also shows that 17.5 per cent of people aged 75 years and over have not had a vaccine within the past 6 months, putting them more at risk of severe disease.

“We urge everyone in this age group, as well as those living in a care home or who are clinically vulnerable, to ensure they get their spring booster for protection against serious illness.

COVID-19 has not gone away and we should all remember to keep up good hand and respiratory hygiene. It is also sensible to wear a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces. If you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection, and a high temperature or feel unwell, try to stay at home or away from others – especially elderly or vulnerable people.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity (including case rates) has increased in week 23 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) increased in England to 170 in week 23, compared to 78 in the previous week.

Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 23 was 3.3 per 100,000 population, a slight increase from 3.0 in the previous week.

The hospital admission rate for week 23 was 6.10 per 100,000 population, an increase from 4.65 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 remain highest in the North East, with a rate of 10.70 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Clinical Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

After a period of low case rates, we are now seeing increases in outbreaks within care homes and in hospitalisations among those aged 80 years and over.

It is encouraging that we are not seeing an increase in intensive care unit (ICU) admissions but we are monitoring data closely and assessing the possible impact of subvariants BA.4 and BA.5.

As we enter summer, it’s still important to remember that COVID-19 has not gone away and to get vaccinated to reduce the risk of becoming seriously ill with the virus. If you’re not yet up to date with your jabs please come forward now – it’s not too late to get protected.

Remember to observe good hand and respiratory hygiene. It is also sensible to wear a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces.

Professor Steven Riley, Director General of Data, Analytics and Surveillance at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

High case rates and increasing numbers of hospitalisations remind us that the pandemic is not over and COVID-19 still poses a real risk to vulnerable people. As people mix more, we have also seen increasing levels of common infections such as flu and norovirus.

If you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection such as a high temperature try to stay at home or away from other people – especially those who you know are vulnerable.

While people will be looking forward to catching up with friends and family over the Easter period, it’s important to keep indoor spaces well ventilated, wash your hands regularly and wear a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces or when visiting people at highest risk of severe illness with COVID19.

It’s important to catch up on any primary or booster jabs, so if you’re not up to date, please make sure you get a jab.

The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and over.

Dame Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

The pandemic is not over and how the virus will develop over time remains uncertain. COVID-19 still poses a real risk to many of us, particularly with case rates and hospitalisations on the rise. That is why it is sensible to wear a mask in enclosed spaces, keep indoor spaces ventilated and stay away from others if you have any symptoms of a respiratory illness, including COVID-19.

Vaccination remains the best way to protect us all from severe disease and hospitalisation due to COVID-19 infection. If you have not yet come forward for your primary or booster I would urge you to do so straight away. The NHS vaccine programme is there to help you and the sooner you are vaccinated the sooner you and your family and friends will be protected.

The rate at which we’re currently seeing cases increasing is a reminder to us all that the pandemic is not over. Hospital admissions and cases of COVID-19 have continued to rise and we can expect to see further increases before we start to see a decline.

Vaccination is the key to staying safe from serious illness and it’s vital that everyone gets all of their recommended doses. Wearing a face covering in crowded or enclosed spaces, socialising outside where possible, and always observing good hand hygiene will also help to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Anyone with symptoms or a positive tests should limit their contact with others as much as possible.

COVID-19 is still circulating at high levels due to the high transmissibility of circulating variants and expected increases in social mixing.

While rates of severe disease and death due to COVID-19 remain low, hospital admissions have risen and we will therefore continue to monitor this data closely.

Vaccination remains our first and best line of defence against illness, and it’s vital that everyone has had their latest dose. We can all help reduce transmission by wearing a face covering in crowded or enclosed spaces, washing hands regularly and keeping rooms well ventilated.

Professor Steven Riley, Director General of Data, Analytics and Surveillance at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

This week we have incorporated data on reinfections to improve our understanding of how the virus and its impact has changed. While the pandemic is not over, it is promising that we are no longer seeing rapid rises in incidents of infection and hospitalisation.

We urge everyone to get their vaccine and booster jab as soon as they are eligible, to test regularly withLFDsbefore meeting anyone who is vulnerable and to take aPCRtest if they have symptoms.  Please keep playing your part to reduce the spread of COVID-19.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that at a national level COVID-19 activity remained stable in most indicators of week 3 of 2022.

COVID-19 hospitalisations decreased in most age groups, though have increase slightly in those aged 0 to 4, 5 to 14 and those aged 15 to 24.

The overall number of reported acute respiratory incidents decreased in the past week in England.

Case rates were highest in those aged 5 to 9, with a weekly rate of 2,473.9 per 100,000 population.

The lowest case rates were in those aged 70 to 79, with a weekly rate of 286.9 per 100,000 population.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-class-autonomous-minehunters-to-protect-royal-navy,Press release,World-class autonomous minehunters to protect Royal Navy,The UK and France reaffirmed their long-standing defence relationship today by committing to a joint programme for Autonomous Minehunting Systems that will detect and neutralise mines around the world.,Ministry of Defence,26 November 2020,"Speaking at the Franco-British Council Defence Conference, the Defence Secretary announced a £184-million investment in the joint Maritime Mine Counter Measure (MMCM) programme, which will create new systems to combat sea mines and keep ships and personnel away from danger.

The contract will support 215 jobs across the UK at Thales sites in Somerset and Plymouth, as well as in the wider supply chain, including L3 Harris in Portsmouth, Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire and Alba Ultrasound in Glasgow.

This investment follows the substantial £16.5-billion settlement in the Spending Review for Defence over four years that will modernise the armed forces, reinvigorate the shipbuilding industry and bring jobs and prosperity to every part of the UK.

This £184-million contract offers a huge leap forward for the Royal Navy’s autonomous capabilities in the detection and defeat of sea mines. As the Armed Forces puts modernisation at the heart of its future strategy, these systems will protect vital shipping lanes, commercial traffic and our brave personnel from these deadly devices.

The programme also underpins a deep and ever-strengthening relationship with France and marks the tenth anniversary of the Lancaster House treaties between our two nations.

The Defence Secretary was speaking at this year’s virtual Franco-British Council Defence Conference, which also featured French defence minister Florence Parly, Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nick Carter and his French counterpart Ched d’État-Major des Armées François Lecointre.

This month marks the 10th anniversary of the historic Lancaster House treaties on defence, security and nuclear cooperation between the UK and France. The historic commitment has established a long-term partnership between the two countries and includes the fully operational Combined Joint Expeditionary Force (CJEF) – a force able to rapidly deploy over 10,000 personnel in response to a crisis.

Both nations are deployed around the world together in places such as the Middle East combating Daesh and in Estonia as part ofNATO’s Enhanced Forward Presence. In Mali, three RAF Chinooks and 100 UK personnel are deployed in a non-combat role in support of French counter-extremist operations.

The Royal Navy is world leader in mine countermeasures, having been regularly called upon to deal with mines and other historic ordnance, left over from the Second World War, around the United Kingdom. In recent times, the UK has been involved in minehunting operations across the world, including the Gulf and off Libya.

Following a successful demonstration phase and trials completed in October 2020, the new contract will produce three sets of minehunting equipment, consisting of:

Autonomous vessel – a boat controlled and operated from a “mother ship/base.”
Towed sonar – a sonar which is towed/dragged behind the vessel to locate ordnance.
Mine neutralisation system – a remotely operated underwater vehicle which is used once the mine is located to neutralise the device and prevent its detonation.

When used together, these three elements are known as the Primary System. This next-generation mine hunting capability is designed to potentially replace conventional crewed mine hunting vessels, such as the Royal Navy’s Hunt and Sandown class ships, with autonomous systems.

I am enormously excited by the potential of the future minehunting capability. This will allow us to deliver minehunting more effectively, more efficiently and more safely, and to integrate even more closely with our French counterparts in this important area.

The UK element of theMMCMprogramme was negotiated by Defence Equipment and Support (DE&S), the procurement arm of the UK Ministry of Defence.

This ground-breaking technology brings with it a step-change in capability for the Royal Navy which is a bold step into the digital and autonomous world. I’m incredibly proud ofDE&Sand the Royal Navy team who have worked tirelessly with our French colleagues to deliver on this contract.

Technologies such as autonomy and AI are transforming societies and warfare at an exponential rate. This contract represents the next generation for Anglo-French minehunting, delivering a world leading capability that will keep our armed forces safe and create and secure vital jobs across the UK and our supply chain. We look forward to delivering the next stage in this exciting hi-tech programme.

The first equipment sets are due to be delivered in late 2022. It will commence operational evaluation prior to entering service with the Royal Navy."

Building on the Prime Minister’s 10 Point Plan, today’s UK Net Zero Strategy sets out a comprehensive economy-wide plan for how British businesses and consumers will be supported in making the transition to clean energy and green technology – lowering the Britain’s reliance on fossil fuels by investing in sustainable clean energy in the UK, reducing the risk of high and volatile prices in the future, and strengthening our energy security.

The commitments made will unlock up to £90 billion of private investment by 2030, and support 440,000 well-paid jobs in green industries in 2030. This will provide certainty to businesses to support the UK in gaining a competitive edge in the latest low carbon technologies – from heat pumps to electric vehicles – and in developing thriving green industries in our industrial heartlands – from carbon capture to hydrogen, backed by new funding.

As part of the strategy, new investment announced today includes:

The policies and spending brought forward in the Net Zero Strategy mean that since theTen Point Plan, we have mobilised £26 billion of government capital investment for the green industrial revolution. More than £5.8 billion of foreign investment in green projectshas also been securedsince the launch of the Ten Point Plan, along with at least 56,000 jobs in the UK’s clean industries – andanother 18 dealshave been set out at the Global Investment Summit to support growth in vital sectors such as wind and hydrogen energy, sustainable homes and carbon capture and storage.

Through energy efficiency measures, falling costs of renewables and more, the measures in the strategy also mean people’s energy bills will be lower by 2024 than if no action was taken particularly as gas prices rise.

As the first major economy to commit in law to net zero by 2050 and hosts of the historic UNCOP26climate summit, the UK is leading international efforts and setting the bar for countries around the world to follow. The UK has hit every carbon budget to date - today’s Net Zero Strategy sets out clear policies and proposals for meeting our fourth and fifth carbon budgets, and keeps us on track for carbon budget 6, our ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), while setting out a vision for a decarbonised economy in 2050.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:

The UK’s path to ending our contribution to climate change will be paved with well-paid jobs, billions in investment and thriving green industries – powering our green industrial revolution across the country.

By moving first and taking bold action, we will build a defining competitive edge in electric vehicles, offshore wind, carbon capture technology and more, whilst supporting people and businesses along the way.

With the major climate summitCOP26just around the corner, our strategy sets the example for other countries to build back greener too as we lead the charge towards global net zero.

Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said:

There is a global race to develop new green technology, kick-start new industries and attract private investment. The countries that capture the benefits of this global green industrial revolution will enjoy unrivalled growth and prosperity for decades to come – and it’s our job to ensure the UK is fighting fit.

Today’s plan will not only unlock billions of pounds of investment to boost the UK’s competitive advantage in green technologies, but will create thousands of jobs in new, future-proof industries – clearly demonstrating that going green and economic growth go hand in hand.

Both the Net Zero and Heat and Building Strategies build on the Prime Minister’s Ten Point Plan in November 2020 which laid the foundations for a green industrial revolution, kick-starting billions of pounds of investment in new and green industries to help level up the country. To date, the UK has decarbonised faster than any other G7 country.

Published alongside these two strategies today is HM Treasury’s Net Zero Review, an analytical report which explores the key issues as the UK decarbonises. It helps to build a picture of where opportunities could arise and the factors to be taken into account when designing decarbonisation policy. While there are costs in reaching net zero, the cost of inaction is much higher.

Please find the fullNet Zero Strategyand theHeat and Buildings Strategy.

The strategies published today build on an ambitious set of existing policies: the Prime Minister’s Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution, the Energy White Paper, North Sea Transition Deal, Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy, Transport Decarbonisation Plan, and Hydrogen Strategy, and the recent landmark commitment to decarbonise the UK’s electricity system by 2035.

The Net Zero Strategy will be submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as the UK’s second Long Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategy under the Paris Agreement.

Also published today is UK’s first Net Zero Research and Innovation Framework which will support the delivery of the Net Zero Strategy by setting out the key net zero research and innovation priority areas for the UK over the next 5-10 years. Together these documents set out a long-term plan for the green economy that the govt will report against.

COP President-Designate, Alok Sharma said:

The UK continues to show climate leadership as we publish our roadmap to net zero by 2050. It shows the wealth of opportunities, including thousands of new skilled jobs, that a transition to a green economy can herald.

WithCOP26opening in less than 2 weeks, leaders stepping up with more commitments has never been more urgent. I’m calling on countries across the world, particularly the G20, to commit to net zero by mid-century, ambitious 2030 emissions reduction targets and to set out credible implementation plans so we can limit global warming to well below 2C and keep the goal of 1.5 degrees within reach.

Energy and Climate Change Minister Greg Hands said:

As we prepare to host the UNCOP26climate summit in Glasgow next week, the world is looking to the UK to show leadership and delivery as we plot our path to net zero emissions by 2050.

Today’s plans will provide British consumers and businesses with the tools and the confidence they need to make the transition to clean energy, unlocking investment in low carbon technologies and creating high skilled jobs as we build a cleaner future that’s underpinned by a secure, home-grown energy sector.

Environment Secretary George Eustice said:

Today’s plans set the UK on a clear path to net zero by 2050 and demonstrate how we will harness the power of nature to get there.

As well as restoring and protecting peatlands and increasing tree planting, we are determined to grow towards a net zero economy. Whether it’s funding to help farmers decarbonise or support to deliver a circular economy to cut down on waste, we will support sectors to adapt.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said:

We’re going further and faster than ever to tackle climate change. Together with an additional £620 million to support vehicle grants and charging infrastructure, our plans for an ambitious zero emission vehicle mandate show that we’re leading the world on the switch toEVs.

We published our Transport Decarbonisation Plan in July which was just the start – as we look ahead to theCOP26climate change conference and beyond, we need to continue our efforts to deliver its ambitious commitments. This will provide certainty to drivers and industry as we create sustainable economic growth, boost job opportunities and clean up the air in our towns and cities.

Not only this – by boosting our world-leading sustainable aviation fuels programme with £180 million in funding, we can accelerate the development of sustainable aviation fuel plants in the UK and create thousands of green jobs across the country.

Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said:

We need a whole systems approach for reducing our carbon emissions. The Net Zero Strategy establishes what is needed to decarbonise our economy over the next 30 years. In particular, it highlights the intensive activity needed in the next decade - from early-stage research to deployment of mature technologies, through to better understanding on how to help people make greener choices.

David Wright, Chief Engineer at National Grid said:

In the lead up toCOP26, the UK has certainly raised the bar on ambition to tackle climate change – and we now need to see what this means in practice. Today’s strategy builds on the 10 point plan, the energy white paper and a number of strategies that have been published in recent months, outlining what is needed to deliver a net zero future. Now the focus needs to be on implementation and investment in infrastructure and technologies. We’re at a critical stage in the journey where net zero is possible with the technologies and opportunities we have today and, in order to deliver on this, we have to accelerate and ramp up efforts to deploy long-term solutions at scale.

Emma Pinchbeck, Chief Executive, Energy UK said:

The energy industry has led the way in reducing emissions in the UK - rapidly expanding our sources of clean power and investing billions every year. We will play a central role in the drive to reach Net Zero and by committing to have a decarbonised power system in place in the 2030s, our sector will also be providing the clean power needed to transform other sectors like housing and transport. The energy industry has shown what is possible with the right policies in place and is ready to invest further helping create jobs and growth across the country.

Tanya Sinclair, Director of Policy UK, Ireland and Nordics, ChargePoint said:

ChargePoint welcomes the government’s bold step towards transport decarbonisation by announcing the introduction of aZEVmandate today, the first commitment of its type in Europe. We have seen the positive impacts onEVuptake of these schemes in North America, where they have significantly built up availability and consumer confidence of electric vehicles.

Across our fast-growing charging sector, a UKZEVmandate will create huge confidence for those operating and investing in the charging industry. This industry - consisting mainly of startups and scale ups - will for the first time be able to clearly anticipate demand for charging infrastructure and create a clear roadmap to meet these targets.

With this new policy, the UK is taking an essential step on the road to 2030 as well as contributing to the creation of a betterEVdriver experience in the UK.

Paul Willcox, Managing Director, Vauxhall, said:

Vauxhall welcomes the UK government’s announcement to implement a zero emission vehicle mandate which will provide clarity to the UK motor industry and the rest of the electric vehicle ecosystem, on the basis of a 360-degree approach.  Vauxhall believes aZEVmandate can work in the UK provided there are complimentary targets on the other key parts of the electric vehicle ecosystem which are key to driving Britain to a more sustainable transport infrastructure.  With our Ellesmere Port plant set to become the first electric vehicle only factory within the Stellantis group, we look forward to working with the government on the detail of how aZEVmandate can be implemented and help support a sustainable vehicle marketplace in the UK.

Stephen Phipson,CEOof Make UK said:

Today’s plans are a very positive step on the journey to net zero by 2050, with practical support to help businesses transition to green and clean production processes. The creation of 2 hydrogen clusters in Britain’s industrial heartlands puts our manufacturing powerhouse at the centre of innovation and will enable companies to make the switch away from fossil fuels at greater speed. It will be vital to produce enough hydrogen supply to feed not just the industrial clusters but all the manufacturers across the country.

The infrastructure boost forEVcars and vans is a much needed and practical step forward and will be welcomed by industry. But defining the technology forHGVs, which are vital to manufacturing logistics, must not be forgotten. To build on this, it is important to make sure that today’s green investment plans go hand in hand with upskilling of the country’s workforces to make sure that we have the green skills to make these essential changes a reality.

Simon Roberts, Chief Executive of Sainsbury’s, said:

This plan is a significant step forward in accelerating a green transition and will increase choice and opportunity for people and businesses of all sizes across the country. Sainsbury’s will continue to play its part in tackling the climate crisis by helping our customers and colleagues eat better, inspiring them to make simple changes that are better for them and better for the planet too. We are committed to keeping 1.5 degrees within reach and helping the UK achieve net zero by 2050, now is the time for all of us to collaborate across industry and government to protect and restore our planet for generations to come.

Clare Barclay, Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft UK, said:

The clock is ticking. We have to turn pledges into performance and the government’s Net Zero strategy coupling investment in innovation, energy and skills is welcome. Those who have the scale and resources to create lasting change must do so, enabled by technology. The UK can lead the way to the decarbonised economies we so urgently need.

Phil Bentley, Chief Executive Officer, Mitie, said:

The publication of the government’s Net Zero Strategy is hugely welcome. We’ve already committed to reaching net zero carbon emissions across Mitie’s estate by 2025 and anything which assists more businesses in setting ambitious targets is good news.

This announcement demonstrates government’s commitment to delivering decarbonisation across Britain and will provide businesses with the certainty they need to invest in their own net zero strategies, while also helping accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles.

Louise Kingham, BP’s Senior Vice President, Europe and Head of Country, UK said:

BP welcomes today’s announcement and we look forward to our role supporting the UK’s net zero ambitions, be it progressing green infrastructure such as the East Coast ClusterCCUSproject, developing hydrogen projects, rolling outEVcharge points, developing offshore wind, and creating the green jobs of the future."

Small businesses will be given additional time to prepare for the implementation of automatic enrolment. The timetable will be adjusted so that no small employers are affected by the reforms before the end of this Parliament.

The rate of pensions contributions will remain unchanged until all businesses have started automatic enrolment. This measure will benefit all employers.

Minister for Pensions Steve Webb said:

Our society and economy needs to be based on a foundation of saving, not debt. Automatic enrolment will help millions save, and to not act will leave people poorer in retirement. That is why I am confirming today that automatic enrolment will start on time and all employers will be part of it.

We recognise that small businesses are operating in tough economic times so we are softening the timetable for implementation to give them some additional breathing space. This is a sensible step that ensures long term pension issues are addressed while meeting the short and medium term needs of small business.

We are committed to ensuring the employees of these small businesses get the chance to save and that is why no one will miss out.

Under the revised timeline, small business would begin automatically enrolling their staff in May 2015, instead of the current timing of April 2014. Half of all workers will still be automatically enrolled before the end of this Parliament.

Small business includes any business with less than 50 employees.

Further details will be published in January.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-leading-environment-act-becomes-law,Press release,World-leading Environment Act becomes law,"Legislation will improve air and water quality, tackle waste, increase recycling, halt the decline of species, and improve our natural environment.","Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, Forestry Commission, Environment Agency, Natural England and The Rt Hon George Eustice",10 November 2021,"Legislation that will protect and enhance our environment for future generations has now passed into UK law.

Through the Act, we will clean up the country’s air, restore natural habitats, increase biodiversity, reduce waste and make better use of our resources.

It will halt the decline in species by 2030, require new developments to improve or create habitats for nature, and tackle deforestation overseas.

It will help us transition to a more circular economy, incentivising people to recycle more, encouraging businesses to create sustainable packaging, making household recycling easier and stopping the export of polluting plastic waste to developing countries.

These changes will be driven by new legally binding environmental targets, and enforced by a new, independent Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) which will hold government and public bodies to account on their environmental obligations.

Environment Secretary George Eustice said:

The Environment Act will deliver the most ambitious environmental programme of any country on earth.

It will halt the decline of species by 2030, clean up our air and protect the health of our rivers, reform the way in which we deal with waste and tackle deforestation overseas.

We are setting an example for the rest of the world to follow.

The Environment Act includes a new legally binding target on species abundance for 2030, which will help to reverse declines of iconic British species like the hedgehog, red squirrel and water vole.

The UK will now be able to go further than ever before to clamp down on illegal deforestation and protect rainforests, through apackage of measureswill ensure that greater resilience, traceability and sustainability are built into the UK’s supply chains.

The Act will crack down on water companies that discharge sewage into rivers, waterways and coastlines. It will see a duty enshrined in law toensure water companies secure a progressive reduction in the adverse impacts of discharges from storm overflows. New duties will also require the government to publish a plan to reduce sewage discharges from storm overflows by September 2022 and report to Parliament on the progress towards implementing the plan.

Natural England Chair Tony Juniper said:

It is imperative that we step up action to boost nature recovery if we are to tackle the twin challenges of biodiversity loss and climate change.

This landmark Act will give us more of the tools and the momentum we need to really put nature on the road to recovery during this decade, enabling us to have more, better, bigger and connected areas of natural habitats, bringing a range of practical benefits and permitting more people to enjoy the wonders of the natural world, while improving wider environmental quality at the same time.

We will work across Government, industry and society to help make it happen. The creation of Local Nature Recovery Strategies will be key in helping us to build a Nature Recovery Network across the country, backed by other measures in the new Act, including mandatory Biodiversity Net Gain for built development and a healthier freshwater environment.

Emma Howard Boyd CBE, Chair of the Environment Agency, said:

We need strong laws, investment by the private sector and clear, well-funded regulation to protect the environment. Without this, we will not see the progress we all want.

The new legal targets for water in the Environment Act today will help wider efforts to tackle pollution, reduce demand for water and secure clean and plentiful water for all.

It is good to see these laws pass as we work to protect the natural world, help people to stay safe from flooding and support communities, businesses and government to make the country more resilient to climate shocks.

Forestry Commission Chair Sir William Worsley said:

As the government’s leading forestry experts, the Forestry Commission supports the new measures included in the Environment Act which gives our woodlands much needed protection, so we can ensure they live on and continue to bring benefits to people, nature and climate.

We are excited about new measures that will improve Forestry Commission’s enforcement powers to help us further protect England’s woodlands from illegal felling, including our most precious ancient woodlands.

Increasing tree planting now is an important step towards creating a more wooded country, and we look forward to working closely with the government as they consider a long-term tree target, which could be introduced through the new powers in the Environment Act.

Work on implementing Environment Act policies is well underway. We have started work on developing legally binding environmental targets, and launchedconsultations on the deposit return schemes for drinks containers,extended producer responsibility for packagingandconsistent recycling collectionswhich will transform the way we deal with our rubbish.

We have also published adraft Principles Policy Statementwhich will put protecting the environment at the heart of future policy.

TheOffice for Environmental Protection was set up in an interim, non-statutory form in July, providing independent oversight of the Government’s environmental progress and accelerating the foundation of the full body. The OEP will formally commence its statutory functions shortly.

Dame Glenys Stacey, Chair of the OEP said:

The Environment Act is a cornerstone of the government’s ambitions to tackle ever more pressing environmental issues.

I am delighted that the Act creates the independent Office for Environmental Protection, and gives us the tools for our job – to protect and improve the environment by holding government and public authorities to account. We are well underway with establishing a functionally independent, fully operational OEP from early in the new year.

There has never been a more crucial time for us all to work to protect and improve our environment. The OEP will play its full part.

The Environment Act has become law during the UK’s hosting of the COP26 summit in Glasgow, during which the UK has brought the world together to secure ambitious commitments to tackle climate change.

Nick Molho, Executive Director at the Aldersgate Group, said:

The passage of the Environment Act into law marks a major milestone for the UK, particularly as it hosts the important COP26 climate summit. Having a framework which supports nature restoration and looks at the whole of the environment – including land as well as sea – is a key step forward in efforts to reverse the decline of nature.

Businesses have long supported an ambitious and robust Environment Act, and having legally binding long-term targets will play a significant role in making continuous improvements to the natural environment.

Dr Richard Benwell, CEO of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said:

Becoming the first country with a legal target to halt wildlife decline by 2030 is a world-leading innovation and testament to the huge public and parliamentary demand to improve our state of nature.

Now there’s no time to lose for action. 2030 is an ecological heartbeat away, so the whole of Whitehall must work together on a scientifically sound plan to meet this “net zero for nature”, so that England can lead the way ahead of next year’s global nature negotiations.

The Environment Act will deliver:

…",Department for Work and Pensions and The Rt Hon Lord Freud,27 February 2012,"An extra £5.9m of Government funding has been allocated to councils across London to help benefit claimants renting in the private sector.

The funds are part of a £49m package that will be allocated to British councils to help with the transition to new Housing Benefit rules until 2015. This is on top of the £130m Discretionary Housing Payments and the £10m for homelessness prevention in London.

The funds will help residents and councils to renegotiate their rents with landlords and find more affordable properties.

Minister for Welfare Reform Lord Freud said:

The cost of paying Housing Benefit in the private rented sector has nearly doubled in a decade, so it’s only right that we introduce new reforms to get these spiralling costs under control. The additional £5.9m funding for London will help councils to prepare and assist residents make the transition.

We are already seeing councils pulling together to create innovative projects to target support for tenants and work with landlords to renegotiate rents or find affordable properties.

We look forward to councils continuing to work together and with local groups to make the very best use of these new resources.

Last year, 10 projects across the UK were created with the first £4m of funding and all councils across Britain will now share the latest £15m slice of funding.

The Government hopes councils will use the first projects as examples of how they can pool resources and co-operate to support residents.

Projects established last year are seeing councils co-operating and working with a range of voluntary bodies including:"

More than 25 jobs will be supported through the contract to deliverSWEEPat the Dorset-based company, plus 48 more jobs in the supply chain.

It will allow personnel to neutralise mines from a remote and safe distance at sea while on operations worldwide, keeping sailors safe.

This next-generation autonomous technology will be instrumental to our goal of protecting the safety and security of our personnel, while also reaffirming the UK’s unwavering commitment to improve the safety of international waters.

Using highly innovative technology,SWEEPwill detect more modern and smarter digital sea mines, which target ships and submarines passing overhead.

EachSWEEPsystem comprises an Autonomous Surface Vessel that tows a sensor unit behind it. The unit uses magnetic, acoustic and electric technology to identify and neutralise different types of sea mines. The system is controlled by a Portable Command Centre which can be based at sea or on land.

The technology, which has been developed in the UK, can be rapidly deployed by land, sea and air and will offer increased protection to military and commercial vessels.

This cutting-edgeSWEEPtechnology follows hot on the heels of the contract negotiated for equally innovative autonomous minehunters and provides the Royal Navy with the increased capability they need to deal with modern mine threats.

The first system will be delivered in late 2022 and will enter operational evaluation before service at a later date."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-unveils-a-budget-for-growth,News story,Chancellor unveils a Budget for growth,"A revolution in childcare, a £27 billion tax cut for business and a trio of freezes to help families with the cost-of-living headlined the Chancellor’s Spring Budget today, Wednesday 15 March.",HM Treasury,15 March 2023,"Aimed at achieving long-term, sustainable economic growth that delivers prosperity for the people of the United Kingdom, the Spring Budget breaks down barriers to work, unshackles business investment and tackles labour shortages head on.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt said:

“Our plan is working – inflation falling, debt down and a growing economy.

“Britain is on a lasting path to growth with a revolution in childcare support, the biggest ever employment package and the best investment incentives in Europe.”

The Chancellor announced 30 hours of free childcare for every child over the age of 9 months, with support being phased in until every single eligible working parent of under 5s gets this support by September 2025.

The government will also pay the childcare costs of parents on Universal Credit moving into work or increasing their hours upfront, rather than in arrears – removing a major barrier to work for those who are on benefits. The maximum they can claim will also be boosted to £951 for one child and £1,630 for two children – an increase of around 50%.

The Chancellor went on to set out plans to continue to support households with cost-of-living pressures including keeping the Energy Price Guarantee at £2,500 for the next three months and ending the premium that over 4 million households pay on their prepayment meter, bringing their charges into line with comparable customers who pay by direct debit. Taken together with all the government’s efforts to help households with higher costs, these measures bring the total support to an average of £3,300 per UK household over 2022-23 and 2023-24.

To help household budgets further, the planned 11 pence rise in fuel duty will be cancelled, maintaining last year’s 5p cut for another twelve months,    saving a typical driver another £100 on top of the £100 saved so far since last year’s cut.

The generosity of Draught Relief has also been significantly extended from 5% to 9.2%, so that the duty on an average draught pint of beer served in a pub both does not increase from August and will be up to 11 pence lower than the duty in supermarkets. The commitment to duty on a pub pint being lower than the supermarket has been termed the “Brexit Pubs Guarantee” by the Chancellor, and this change will also be enjoyed by every pub in Northern Ireland thanks to the Windsor Framework.

The Chancellor also set out a comprehensive plan to remove the barriers to work facing those on benefits, those with health conditions and older workers. An increase in the pensions Annual Allowance from £40,000 to £60,000 and the abolition of the Lifetime Allowance will remove the disincentives to working for longer. A new ‘Returnerships’ skills offer for older workers and more stringent Universal Credit job search requirements also feature in the plan that will boost the UK’s workforce, fill vacancies and support economic growth.

In line with the government’s vision for the UK to be the best place in Europe for companies to locate, invest and grow, a new policy of ‘full expensing’ will be introduced for the next three years to boost business investment in an effective cut to corporation tax of £9 billion per year. This makes the UK the joint most competitive capital allowances regime in the OECD and the only major European economy to have such a policy. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that this will increase business investment by 3% for every year it is in place. Mr Hunt signalled an intention to make this scheme – which covers equipment for factories, computers and other machinery - permanent when responsible to do so.

Accompanying forecasts by the OBR confirm that with the package of measures Mr Hunt set out today, the economy is on track to grow with inflation halved this year and debt falling – meeting all of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s economic priorities. This comes alongside the confirmation that there are no new tax rises within the Spring Budget.

Childcare

Significant reforms to childcare will remove barriers to work for nearly half a million parents with a child under 3 in England not working due to caring responsibilities, reducing discrimination against women and benefitting the wider economy in the process.

Employment

The Chancellor set out a comprehensive plan to help people move into work, increase their hours, and extend their working lives, including for those on benefits.

Enterprise

The Chancellor put forward a plan to boost innovation, drive business investment and hold down energy costs.

Levelling Up

To level up growth across the UK and spread opportunity everywhere, local communities will be empowered to command their economic destiny.

Many of today’s decisions on tax and spending apply in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As a result of decisions that do not apply UK-wide, the Scottish Government will receive around an additional £320 million over 2023-24 and 2024-25, the Welsh Government will receive £180 million, and the Northern Ireland Executive will receive £130 million.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-guide-proves-work-experience-is-much-more-than-making-tea,Press release,New guide proves work experience is much more than making tea,The UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES) has published a guide dispelling myths around work experience and highlighting its role in early careers.,UK Commission for Employment and Skills and Jenny Willott,19 February 2014,"The guide, “Not just making tea: reinventing work experience”, has been published by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES), and highlights common misconceptions surrounding the benefits of work experience and the value it can present to both employers and young people alike.

The latest findings fromUKCES, based on interviews with over 90,000 employers, show the main reason employers think young people are unprepared for work is lack of experience. Further research shows that three quarters (74%) of employers claim experience is significant or critical when recruiting young people.

Despite the high demand for experience, just 27% of employers offer young people the chance to gain work experience.

Julie Kenny,UKCESCommissioner and Chief Executive at Pyronix, said:

Work experience is far more than tea rounds and photocopying: it’s about giving young people of all ages the skills, confidence and experience they need to progress into meaningful jobs. As employers, we are best placed to offer young people these opportunities.

Work experience is a solution to the catch-22 trap many young people and employers face – employers increasingly demand recruits with experience, but those potential recruits are struggling to get a foot on the ladder in order to gain that same experience.

Katerina Rüdiger, Head of Skills and Policy Campaigns at theCIPD- who today published a set of top tips for employers onMaking work experience work, the latest output from their Learning to Work programme – explained:

Employers tell us that one of the key things they look for when they take on new recruits is previous experience. However, as it becomes increasingly difficult for young people to access the labour market, many risk becoming trapped in a ‘no experience, no job’ cycle.

This is as much a disadvantage for employers as it is for young people, as organisations risk not being able to recruit individuals with the skills and attributes needed to make their business a success. Offering high quality work experience placements is an easy way for employers to ensure they will have access to a wide range of talented new recruits who have the work-based experience they crave.

Businesses who offer work experience cite benefits such as improved brand loyalty, better market insights and improved staff development and engagement. 20% of employers who offer work experience also say it helps them when recruiting new staff.

For young people, the benefits extend through to undergraduates studying at university. Those young people who already have work experience on their CV when leaving university are proven to get better degrees, earn higher wages and are less likely to be unemployed.

Work experience is more than the traditional week or two week placement during the summer term of tea-making, filing and making phone calls. Businesses can inspire young people and give them experience in many different ways, including talks in schools, mentoring, mock interviews and more.

Jenny Willott, Minister for Employment Relations and Consumer Affairs, said she welcomed the report and would encourage further research into the work experience on offer currently, and what it could look like in the future:

This report highlights the importance of good quality work experience for businesses as well as the young people that participate. Work experience can give young people the knowledge they need to help them begin their career. It also gives businesses the opportunity to recruit from a wide and diverse group of potential employees.

The Work Programme was launched in June 2011 and involves private and voluntary sector organisations being paid according to their success in helping the long-term unemployed back into work. More than 200,000 participants had been found some work by September, according to data published by the Employment Related Services Association (ERSA).

By the end of July 2012, 31,000 people had remained in a job for several months - most for six months and some harder-to-help claimants for at least three months.

Industry analysis of the programme shows the taxpayer pays significantly less for each participant on the Work Programme than under previous schemes, like the Future New Deal, where providers were paid up front regardless of whether they delivered results.

The ERSA data shows every job started so far has cost £2,097, compared to £7,495 per job under the Flexible New Deal.

Mark Hoban, Minister for Employment, said:

The Work Programme is succeeding in getting people off benefits and into work. It’s still early days but already thousands of lives are being transformed.

One in four people have been in work, more than half of the early starters have been off benefit and performance is improving.

Previous schemes paid out too much up front regardless of success, but by only paying providers for delivering results, the Work Programme is actually offering the taxpayer real value for money.

Clearly these figures only give a snapshot picture as we’re one year in, and the Work Programme offers support to claimants for two years, but these results are encouraging and something Providers can look to build on.

The Work Programme supports some of the hardest-to-help claimants including the long-term unemployed, disabled and ex-offenders.

Today’s statistics show varying performance among providers. Some are performing well in helping people back to work, but others are not doing as well. The Department is managing providers vigorously to constantly improve performance. Letters have been issued to all providers expressing concern where their performance falls short of requirements and those providers with the lowest performance to date have been issued with formal contract letters

Mr Hoban added:

Some providers have found their feet quickly and are already performing well but there is clearly a mixed picture today. We won’t tolerate second best - getting the long-term unemployed back to work is my priority.

My message to providers under-performing is clear: It’s time to up your game or we will send more participants to those who are coming up with the results.

Today Mr Hoban will visit TNT Post in Victoria where he will meet some of the 50 people the company has taken on through the Work Programme.

Lee Faulkner was out of work for a year before joining the Work Programme and was placed at TNT Post through one of our providers, Ingeus, four months ago. He said:

The Work Programme has found the perfect job for me. I’m working in a friendly environment with other people but have the chance to work independently too. I’m also looking forward to the expansion of TNT Post next year so that I can develop in my new career and run my own team.

Nick Wells, chief executive officer, TNT Post, said:

We have already taken on 50 people through the Work Programme and if we continue to receive the high quality candidates that we have had so far we hope to take on 50% of our new Postie recruits through the Work Programme and Youth Contract.

Providers have flexibility to innovate and to design support that addresses the needs of the individual and the local labour market, rather than having to follow one size fits all processes. They get a small amount of money up front but most payment comes after someone has been in work for up to six months, and extra payments for each month afterwards. Once referred, claimants remain on the Work Programme for two years. Even after  a participant has started a job their provider will offer them in-work support for the balance of their time on the programme.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/300m-support-for-future-mesothelioma-victims,Press release,£300m support for future mesothelioma victims,From today newly diagnosed victims of mesothelioma will receive help through a new support scheme.,Department for Work and Pensions and The Rt Hon Lord Freud,25 July 2012,"From today newly diagnosed victims of mesothelioma will receive help through a new support scheme, the Minister for Welfare Lord Freud and the Association of British Insurers (ABI) have announced.

The new scheme will allow around 3,000 mesothelioma victims across the UK who are unable to claim compensation because they cannot trace a liable employer or employers’ liability insurer to receive approximately £300m in payments in the first 10 years.

Although the majority of people are able to claim compensation through the employers’ liability insurance held by their employer, more than 300 mesothelioma sufferers a year currently lose out on compensation because they are unable to trace a liable employer or employers’ liability insurer.

This new scheme, funded by insurers, will help support mesothelioma sufferers as they face the unique circumstances of this terrible disease. These payments will be in addition to the £200m the insurance industry already pays each year in compensating mesothelioma sufferers.

Lord Freud said:

We have worked tirelessly together with the insurance industry to agree this package of measures on behalf of those who face this terrible disease.

The new scheme will mean that, for the first time, sufferers of diffuse mesothelioma, who cannot trace either a liable employer or employers’ liability insurer, will have access to extra payments.

Otto Thoresen, theABI’s Director General, said:

Mesothelioma is a particularly aggressive cancer and the insurance industry, working with government, is determined to do all it can to ensure that sufferers get the support they need as soon as possible. This package of measures will deliver help to claimants much faster, including to those who would otherwise go un-compensated.

We appreciate the urgency of this disease, and while implementation depends on legislation being put in place, we hope that the scheme will be up and running and the first payments made by July 2014.

The scheme will come into force subject to primary legislation and membership will be compulsory for all employers’ liability insurers. However, Ministers and theABIhave agreed anyone diagnosed with mesothelioma from today (25 July 2012) will be eligible to make a claim.

Membership of the Employers’ Liability Tracing Office (ELTO) - which runs an electronic database of employers’ liability policies - will become compulsory for all employers’ liability insurers, including companies who have provided employers’ liability insurance in the past to ensure that where there is a liable insurer, they will pay the claim.

New measures to speed up the process of receiving compensation for all mesothelioma victims are also being introduced.

The integrated package of measures will also include:"
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/statistical-update-disability-living-allowance-claims,Press release,Statistical update: Disability Living Allowance Claims,Updated statistics on the number of claimants receiving Disability Living Allowance (DLA) between February and May 2012 have been released.,Department for Work and Pensions and The Rt Hon Esther McVey MP,25 February 2013,"Updated statistics on the number of claimants receiving Disability Living Allowance (DLA) between February and May 2012 have been released.

The total number ofDLAclaims in May 2012 was 3,258,440, an increase of 15,000 on the previous quarter.

From April, the Government is replacingDLAwith a new benefit, Personal Independence Payment (PIP), for people of working age (16 to 64), with a new face-to-face assessment.

Minister for Disabled People, Esther McVey, said:

Disability Living Allowance is an outdated benefit introduced over 20 years ago. Personal Independence Payment will include a new face-to-face assessment and regular reviews - something missing in the current system.

The new benefit is designed to better reflect today’s understanding of disability, particularly for people with mental health conditions.

Our welfare reforms are about ensuring the billions we spend on disability benefits give more targeted support to those who need it most.

In ten years, the number of people claimingDLAhas risen by almost 35% (from 2.4 million to 3.3 million).

The Government will continue to spend the same on PIP in 2015/16 as was spent onDLAlast year - around £13bn.

PIP, likeDLAwill continue to be uprated by inflation and the cash rates are the same under PIP as forDLA, recognising the extra costs faced by many disabled people.

LikeDLA, PIP will also be a non-means-tested, non-taxable cash benefit claimed in and out of work. The assessment for PIP will look at how someone’s impairment affects their ability to live an everyday life, and their ability to carry out a broad range of everyday activities such as cooking and getting around.

The new benefit will be phased in - with new claims from the North of England in April and then new claims from the rest of the country from June.

The figures not only highlight the urgent need to reform the welfare system, but also why Ministers are right to press ahead with the reassessment of those on old style incapacity benefits which was rolled out across the country last month.

The Work Capability Assessment (WCA), which determines whether someone is fit for work, has also been substantially improved - the majority of Professor Harrington’s recommendations are now in place with the remainder being implemented by summer to coincide with the first WCAs of incapacity benefit claimants taking part in the full nationwide reassessment.

Employment Minister Chris Grayling said:

Once again we have clear evidence of the need for change in our welfare system. We now know very clearly that the vast majority of new claimants for sickness benefits are in fact able to return to work. That’s why we are turning our attention to existing claimants, who were simply abandoned on benefits.

That’s why we are reassessing all of those claimants, and launching the Work Programme to provide specialist back to work support. We will, of course, carry on providing unconditional support to those who cannot work, but for those who can it’s right and proper that they start back on the road to employment.

For all newESAclaims from 27th October 2008 to 31st August 2010, the result of the initial WCA is as follows (proportions do not sum exactly to 100% due to rounding):"
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/plan-to-drive-down-the-cost-of-clean-heat,Press release,Plan to drive down the cost of clean heat,"Plans to incentivise people to install low-carbon heating systems in a simple, fair and cheap way as they replace their old boilers over the coming decade.","Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, The Rt Hon Kwasi Kwarteng and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson",18 October 2021,"Low carbon more efficient heating systems such as heat pumps will be no more expensive – and in many cases may end up cheaper – to buy and run than gas boilers, under government plans being announced today (Monday 18 October).

Through theHeat and Buildings Strategy, the government has set out its plan to incentivise people to install low-carbon heating systems in a simple, fair and cheap way as they come to replace their old boilers over the coming decade. This will significantly reduce the UK’s dependency on fossil fuels and exposure to global price spikes, whilst supporting up to 240,000 jobs across the UK by 2035.

New grants of £5,000 will be available from April next year to encourage homeowners to install more efficient, low carbon heating systems – like heat pumps that do not emit carbon when used – through a new £450 million 3-year Boiler Upgrade Scheme. These grants mean people choosing to install a heat pump will pay a similar amount as if they were installing a traditional gas boiler.

The £450 million Boiler Upgrade Scheme is part of more than £3.9 billion of new funding being announced today by the government for decarbonising heat and buildings. This will fund the next 3 years of investment through the Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund, the Home Upgrade Grant scheme, the Boiler Upgrade Scheme and the Heat Networks Transformation Programme and reducing carbon emissions from public buildings through the Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme.

The government and industry will also work together to help meet the aim of heat pumps costing the same to buy and run as fossil fuel boilers by 2030, with big cost reductions of between a quarter and a half by 2025 expected as the market expands and technology develops.

This will support the government’s new target for all new heating systems installed in UK homes by 2035 to be either using low-carbon technologies, such as electric heat pumps, or supporting new technologies like hydrogen-ready boilers, where we are confident we can supply clean, green fuel.

No-one will be forced to remove their existing fossil fuel boilers, with this transition of the next 14 years seeing the UK’s households gradually move away from fossil fuel boilers in an affordable, practical and fair way, enabling homeowners to easily make these green choices when the time comes to replace their old boiler.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:

As we clean up the way we heat our homes over the next decade, we are backing our brilliant innovators to make clean technology like heat pumps as cheap to buy and run as gas boilers – supporting thousands of green jobs.

Our new grants will help homeowners make the switch sooner, without costing them extra, so that going green is the better choice when their boiler needs an upgrade.

The Heat and Buildings Strategy sets out how we are taking ‘no-regrets’ action now, particularly on heat pumps, whilst supporting ongoing trials and other research and innovation on our future heating systems, including on hydrogen. We will make a decision on the potential role for hydrogen in heating buildings by 2026, by learning from our Hydrogen Village pilot. Heat pump technology will play a key role in all scenarios, so for those who want to install them now, we are supporting them to do so.

Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said:

Recent volatile global gas prices have highlighted the need to double down on our efforts to reduce Britain’s reliance on fossil fuels and move away from gas boilers over the coming decade to protect consumers in long term.

As the technology improves and costs plummet over the next decade, we expect low carbon heating systems will become the obvious, affordable choice for consumers. Through our new grant scheme, we will ensure people are able to choose a more efficient alternative in the meantime.

Recent volatile gas prices across the world have demonstrated the need for the UK to build a secure, home-grown energy sector which supports households to reduce their reliance on fossils fuels such as using gas boilers, while protecting consumers and businesses from unforeseen price spikes.

Over the coming years, industry leaders expect electric heat pumps will cost the same as gas boilers to buy and run. UK manufacturers are already making electric heat pumps more attractive to consumers and more affordable and the government wants to incentivise consumers to make the switch as quickly as possible.

To ensure electric heat pumps will be no more expensive to run than gas boilers, ministers want to reduce the price of electricity over the next decade by shifting levies away from electricity to gas. A call for evidence is expected to be published with decisions made in 2022.

Greg Jackson,CEOand founder of Octopus Energy, said:

This Heat and Buildings Strategy will help kick-start a cheap clean heating revolution, by bringing prices down for households and allowing companies to invest in scaling up their clean heating operations. When the new scheme launches in April, Octopus Energy will install heat pumps for about the same cost as gas boilers.

Octopus has already committed £10 million investment to its research and development and training centre dedicated to the decarbonisation of heat, and has begun training engineers at the rate of 1,000 per year.

But this is just the beginning. By scaling up the technology and supply chain in Britain, innovative companies like ours will soon be able to fit and run heat pumps without any government support, bringing us one step closer to making the UK the Silicon Valley of Energy and creating thousands of clean energy jobs throughout the country.

Electric heat pumps are more efficient, safer and cleaner than gas boilers and can help make homes more comfortable with less energy. Today we’ve crossed a massive milestone in our fight against climate change and to reduce Britain’s reliance on expensive, dirty gas.

To help grow the electric heat pump market and expand British manufacturing, a new £60 millionHeat Pump Ready innovation programmeis being announced, part of the £1 billion Net Zero Innovation Portfolio. The scheme will provide funding to drive technological innovation which will make the systems smaller, easier to install and cheaper to run over the coming years.

Kick-starting Britain’s new heat pump industry is expected to protect and create tens of thousands of new jobs in research and development, production, supply chain and installation over the next decade.

The Heat and Buildings Strategy builds on the Prime Minister’s 10 Point Plan, which outlined how decarbonising households and workplaces could support 240,000 jobs across the sector by 2035, with many thousands more into the future in areas such as manufacturing, developing and installing new low-carbon technologies.

With heat in buildings being one of the largest sources of UK carbon emissions, accounting for 21% of the total, there is an urgent need to deliver a mix of new, low-carbon heating solutions to meet our legally-binding target to end the UK’s contribution to climate change by 2050.

Chief Executive of E.ON UK Michael Lewis said:

With the right policy framework in place, we’re confident the cost of a heat pump can be reduced by up to half over the coming years. We welcome proposals in the Heat and Buildings Strategy which are designed to tackle this issue head-on, making the green option the default option. Once we have mass demand, commercial innovation in installation and economies of scale will take over to reduce costs and give customers greater confidence in what is already a tried and trusted technology for many around the world.

Chief Executive of EDF Energy UK Simone Rossi said:

Moving away from fossil fuel heating to electric heat pumps will significantly reduce the carbon footprint of our homes and could also protect consumers from future spikes in wholesale gas prices.

It’s great to see the government backing heat pumps and announcing new policies to increase demand and develop supply chains. These actions will help drive down the cost of heat pumps and enable many more households to make the switch. EDF already offer heat pumps to customers and we look forward to using our experience to help even more people transition.

Chief Executive of ScottishPower Keith Anderson said:

Decarbonising heat is our toughest challenge on the road to Net Zero. With some 23 million UK homes to be converted to low carbon heating by 2050 we need to urgently support the delivery of proven zero carbon technologies, like heat pumps. Deploying heat pumps at scale will drive costs down dramatically over time, and will create wider economic benefits by promoting the UK supply chain and new skilled jobs.

This is where the scale and ambition of the government’s Boiler Upgrade Scheme will be invaluable. Ready access to support grants will kick-start the demand for electric heating, allowing the industry to accelerate the delivery of electrification and quickly bring down upfront costs through innovation and growing the supply chain. Other policies will also be needed to address distortions in energy bill costs and create a level playing field between a heat pump and a gas boiler.

By the end of the decade, with the right policies in place, the combined initial and ongoing costs of a heat pump can be as cheap as a gas boiler.

Adrian Letts,CEOof OVO, said:

The government’s Heat and Buildings Strategy is a hugely important step forward. With the right policies in place to support households and greater deployment, we are confident that heat pump costs can reach cost parity with gas boilers by 2030. There is still a huge challenge ahead, so business and government need to work together to ensure no one is left behind in the transition to zero carbon living.

Phil Hurley, Chair of the Heat Pump Association, said:

The heat pump industry warmly welcomes these bold steps forward. The industry in the best shape it has ever been, with sales this year already double those seen ever before.

This announcement is timed perfectly to take advantage of the Heat Pump Association’s recently-launched training course, with the industry now ready to retrain the UK’s army of installers with the capacity to train up to 40,000 per year, to ensure consumers can find a suitably trained and skilled heat pump installer when they need one.

Today’s announcement will give industry and installers a huge confidence boost that now is the time to scale-up and retrain in preparation for the mass roll out of heat pumps, as well as making heat pumps as affordable as boilers, so all consumers can soon access and enjoy the benefits of affordable, reliable low carbon heating that stands the test of time.

Laura Bishop, Chair of the Ground Source Heat Pump Association, said:

The Ground Source Heat Pump Association warmly welcomes the release of the Heat and Buildings Strategy. We look forward to a consistent policy environment which will drive growth in our sector and the UK economy on the path towards achieving Net Zero.

Ground source heat pumps represent a long-term infrastructure asset which delivers unrivalled efficiencies in generating clean heat, and we hope the policy will underpin the mass market roll out we have been anticipating for some time.

Shaun Edwards, Chief Executive Officer Groupe Atlantic UK, ROI & North America, said:

Ideal Heating welcomes the publication of the Heat and Buildings strategy and the continued support from the UK government to low carbon heating systems, particularly heat pumps. As a manufacturer of multiple heating technologies including heat pumps, we feel we are in an excellent position to support our customers as the market transitions to lower carbon heating solutions.

This commitment from the UK government allows Ideal Heating to continue investment in UK heat pump R&D facilities and skills, as well as additional manufacturing capacity, ensuring we meet the specific demands of UK homes and installers whilst strengthening the local supply chain."

The provisional figures show that we have made 1347 decisions of which:

The Government will continue with its plan for a further limited roll-out from the end of this month before the full nationwide launch in April. Once the nationwide roll-out begins around 1.5m people will be assessed. The Government is already well advanced with the introduction of changes to the work capability assessment recommended in the recent Harrington report and all the planned changes will be in place for the full national roll-out of the programme.

In tandem with the first nationwide decisions coming through in the summer, the Government’s new Work Programme will come on stream, providing comprehensive specialist help to all those with the capability to work.

Employment Minister Chris Grayling said:

The initial findings from Burnley and Aberdeen serve to underline why it’s right to reassess IB claimants and to launch the Work Programme to give those who can work the specialist help they need to do so. Too many people were simply abandoned to a life on benefits; we are determined to put a stop to that terrible waste of potential.

The welfare state in this country is no longer fit for purpose that’s why our broad range of reforms are so important.

The reassessment of incapacity benefits customers which began in the surrounding areas of Burnley and Aberdeen in October, is expected to take three years to complete."

This ambitious new training programme is the next phase in the UK’s support to the Armed Forces of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression.

Using the world-class expertise of the British Army we will help Ukraine to rebuild its forces and scale-up its resistance as they defend their country’s sovereignty and their right to choose their own future.

Around 1,050 UK service personnel are deploying to run the programme, which will take place at MOD sites across the North West, South West and South East of the UK. Each course will last several weeks and will be conducted by elements from 11 Security Force Assistance Brigade.

The training will give volunteer recruits with little to no military experience the skills to be effective in frontline combat. Based on the UK’s basic soldier training, the course covers weapons handling, battlefield first aid, fieldcraft, patrol tactics and the Law of Armed Conflict.

The Government has rapidly procured AK variant assault rifles for the training programme, meaning Ukrainian soldiers can train on the weapons they will be using on the front line. This effort was supported by the Welsh Guards, who tested more than 2,400 such rifles in 17 days to ensure they were ready for the Ukrainians to commence their training.

The UK has also gifted clothing and equipment to support Ukrainian soldiers in their training and deployment back to Ukraine. Each soldier will be issued with:

The UK has a long history of supporting Ukrainian service personnel through Operation ORBITAL, which trained 22,000 Ukrainians between 2015 and 2022.

TheCareerHackcontest was launched in November last year by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES), and asked developers around the globe to build an app based on the UK Commission’s“LMI for All”data, which contains information on the UK labour market, including employment, skills and future job market predictions.

First prize winner for the competition was Tomasz Florczak from Logtomobile in Poland, who won £10,000 for his innovative Career Advisor app, while 16-year-old school student Harry Jones, from Bath, took home a £5,000 prize for his Job Happy entry.

The contest also had a special prize specifically for entrants aged 16-24 in Further Education. In this category 22-year-old IT apprentice Phillip Hardwick won the £5,000 prize for his entry, Career Path. And judges were so impressed with the quality of entrants from the category that they introduced an additional runner-up prize of £2,500, which went to a team effort from students at Barking and Dagenham College in London.

Competition judge Dr Deirdre Hughes OBE, Chair of National Careers Council and a Commissioner for UKCES, said:

As judges we were all highly impressed at the outstanding contributions made by our winners, and of the talent and ability being displayed by the next generation of up-and-coming developers and programmers.

The quality of the submissions was so high we felt the need to introduce an additional prize, but all those that entered should be extremely proud of their efforts.

See our video of skills minister Matthew Hancock MP announcing the Careerhack winners.

The judging panel was made up of technology experts from Google, Ubuntu and HP, alongside representatives from the UK Commission and John Lewis. Judges made their decision based on how innovative the entry was, how viable it was as a working app, the potential it had for making an impact on society and the overall quality of the packaged app.

CareerHack judge Matt Brocklehurst, Product Marketing Manager at Google UK said:

At Google we’re well aware of the importance of making data open and encouraging young, creative talent. CareerHack was a fantastic example of this and we were very impressed by the high standard of entries from everyone who entered - the fact that three of the four winners are young people at the start of their careers is fantastic news.  We  hope these prizes will enable them to get a head start down whichever career path they choose to follow.

Fellow CareerHack judge Cristian Parrino, Vice President of Mobile and Online Services at Ubuntu, added:

The CareerHack competition demonstrated how an open set of data can be used to cater to the needs of people at different stages of their career paths. It was wonderful to see the different flavours of high quality applications and services built on UKCES’s data.

LMI for All has been developed by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, working with a consortium led by the Institute for Employment Research at Warwick University and including Pontydysgu, RayCom and Rewired State.

The Energy Bills Rebate will provide around 28 million households with an upfront discount on their bills worth £200. Energy suppliers will apply the discount to domestic electricity customers from October, with the Government meeting the costs. The discount will then be automatically recovered from people’s bills in equal £40 instalments over the next five years. This will begin from 2023, when global wholesale gas prices are expected to come down.

Households in England, which are in council tax bands A-D, will also receive a £150 rebate. The rebate to bills will be made directly by local authorities from April. This will not need to be repaid. This one-off payment will benefit around 80 per cent of all homes in England and is £1 billion more generous and more targeted towards lower-income families than a VAT cut on energy bills.

On top of this discount, discretionary funding of £144 million will also be provided to support vulnerable people and individuals on low incomes that do not pay Council Tax, or that pay Council Tax for properties in Bands E-H.

Right now, I know the number one issue on people’s minds is the rising cost of living.

That’s why the Government is stepping in with direct support that will help around 28 million households with their rising energy costs over the next year.

We stood behind British people and businesses throughout the pandemic and it’s right we continue to do that as our economy recovers in the months ahead.

During the pandemic this Government has acted decisively to protect jobs and livelihoods, particularly for those on the lowest incomes.

But today we recognise the real and growing concerns people have about the cost of living – and once again we are taking action.

We are delivering a new package of targeted support to help with the financial pressures felt by families right across the country, with additional help for those most in need.

This builds on the changes we’ve made to Universal Credit to put £1,000 more per year into the pockets of hardworking people and the increase to the National Living Wage to advance our vision for a high-wage and financially secure Britain.

The support package comes after energy regulator Ofgem today announced an increase to the energy price cap as a result of the soaring global wholesale price of gas, which has quadrupled in the past year.

This will see almost a £700 increase in energy bills for the average household from April 1 - but, as a result of the targeted Energy Bills Rebate, the vast majority of households will receive £350 to reduce this cost.

The Chancellor also today confirmed plans to go ahead with existing proposals to expand eligibility for the Warm Home Discount by almost a third so that three million vulnerable households will now benefit, as well as the planned £10 uplift to £150 from October. This follows a consultation by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to reform the policy so that more people will benefit.

Devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to receive around £565 million of Barnett funding as a result of the Council Tax Energy Rebate in England. While for energy bills, Northern Ireland will be funded to provide comparable support with around £150 million through the Barnett formula next year.

The Government has delivered a record 500 per cent increase in the amount of renewable energy capacity connected to the grid since 2010. It will provide up to £1.7 billion of direct government funding to enable at least one large scale nuclear project by the end of this parliament. The oil and gas industry continues to play an important role in society as we transition to net zero. However, the present global situation underlines the need to go further to ensure the UK’s clean energy independence, and to protect consumers into the future.

The Government is therefore doubling its efforts to generate more clean, affordable power in this country to meet the target of decarbonising Britain’s electricity system by 2035. So far through the Contracts for Difference (CfDs) scheme, it has successfully awarded contracts totalling almost 16GW of new renewable electricity capacity across multiple technologies, helping to decrease costs of renewable generation significantly.

Today’s energy intervention comes on top of the £12 billion support package the Government is already providing to ease growing cost of living pressures. This includes Cold Weather and Winter Fuel Payments, increasing the National Living Wage to £9.50 in April and providing an effective tax cut for those on Universal Credit - allowing 1.9 million households to keep an average of £1,000 per year."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/jcvi-advises-a-spring-covid-19-vaccine-dose-for-the-most-vulnerable,Press release,JCVI advises a spring COVID-19 vaccine dose for the most vulnerable,The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has advised an additional spring booster dose for the most vulnerable individuals in the population.,UK Health Security Agency,21 February 2022,"Immunity derived from vaccination declines over time and many of the oldest adults received their most recent vaccine dose in September or October 2021.

These individuals are at much higher risk of severe coronavirus (COVID-19). Therefore, as a precautionary strategy to maintain high levels of immunity, an extra spring dose is advised around 6 months after the last vaccine dose for:

adults aged 75 years and over, residents in a care home for older adults

individuals aged 12 years and over who are immunosuppressed, as defined in in the COVID 19 healthcare guidanceGreen Book

The types of vaccine offered for the spring dose will be as follows:

for eligible adults aged 18 years and over, 50mcg Moderna (Spikevax) vaccine or 30mcg Pfizer-BioNTech (Comirnaty) vaccine

for eligible persons aged 12 to 18 years, 30 mcg Pfizer-BioNTech (Comirnaty) vaccine

Despite uncertainties around how the pandemic will develop through the summer, theJCVIbelieves winter is likely to remain the season when the threat from COVID-19 is greatest, both for individuals and the NHS and care homes.

As such, theJCVIhas provided additional interim advice to ministers for the purposes of forward planning that a further booster in the autumn of 2022 is likely to be advised for people who are at higher risk of severe COVID-19.

It remains too early to set out precise details of what that programme may look like, but the committee will provide more definitive advice in due course.

Professor Wei Shen Lim, Chair of COVID-19 vaccination on theJCVI, said:

Last year’s booster vaccination programme has so far provided excellent protection against severe COVID-19.

To maintain high levels of protection for the most vulnerable individuals in the population, an extra spring dose of vaccine is advised ahead of an expected autumn booster programme later this year.

TheJCVIwill continue its rolling review of the vaccination programme and the epidemiological situation, particularly in relation to the timing and value of doses for less vulnerable older adults and those in clinical risk groups ahead of autumn 2022."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-virtual-cyber-school-gives-teens-chance-to-try-out-as-cyber-security-agents-from-home,Press release,New virtual cyber school gives teens chance to try out as cyber security agents from home,Young people encouraged to join online classes to develop problem-solving and cyber skills,"Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, National Crime Agency, National Cyber Security Centre and Matt Warman",1 May 2020,"Thousands of young people are being offered the chance to join avirtual cyber security schoolas part of plans to make sure the country develops the next generation of professional cyber defenders.

At a time when schools remain closed to most children, the online initiative aims to inspire future talent to work in the cyber security sector and give students a variety of extracurricular activities to do from the safety of their homes.

Teens can learn how to crack codes, fix security flaws and dissect criminals’ digital trails while progressing through the game as a cyber agent. This will help them develop important skills needed for future jobs, particularly in cyber security.

The school provides free weekly webinars run by industry experts teaching fundamental security disciplines such as digital forensics, cryptography and operating systems.

Digital Infrastructure Minister Matt Warman said:

This new initiative will give teenagers something fun and educational to do from home and provide them with a glimpse into the life of a cyber security professional.

We have a world-leading cyber sector which plays a crucial role protecting the country and our digital economy, so it is absolutely vital we continue to inspire the next generation of tech talent to help maintain the UK’s strong position.

The move comes as the government announces a number of other online training courses to give UK school pupils the opportunity to learn and develop cyber security skills, this includes the launch of the National Cyber Security Centre’s (NCSC) hugely popularCyberFirst summer courses. The courses are moving online this year to help more than a thousand 14 to 17-year-olds develop important cyber skills from home during the coronavirus pandemic.

NCSC Chief Executive Officer Ciaran Martin said:

Technology is helping us all cope with the coronavirus crisis and is playing an essential role in keeping our businesses moving and our society connected.

It has never been more important for our young people to keep engaged and learn how to protect our digital world - and I’m delighted to see our instructor led CyberFirst summer courses made available online.

Enrolled students will learn how to code and carry out cybersecurity operations in an instructor-led virtual classroom to help guide the students through the programme and build a sense of camaraderie within each cohort.

The National Crime Agency and Cyber Security Challenge UK will also this week announce teenagers can access their online cyber skills platformCyberLandfor free during the coming months. In the game designed to teach teenagers the fundamentals of cyber security, players protect the virtual city ‘CyberLand’ from cyber attacks while learning key skills.

Deputy Director at the NCA’s National Cyber Crime Unit Jim Stokley said:

Many young people have a keen interest in technology and have developed impressive cyber skills.

The virtual cyber school and CyberFirst programmes are great initiatives which will support this next generation of cyber defenders in realising their potential.

We’ve also partnered with Cyber Security Challenge UK to offer free access to their online platform Cyberland where young people will find games that encourage them to improve cyber skills safely and legally.

Computer science teacher & EdTech evangelist Mark Martin said:

This is a great initiative to encourage young people to consider future careers in cyber security and see that they can have a tech job keeping people safe online.

The virtual cyber school will help students learn valuable skills needed to work in the industry in a fun and entertaining way. I encourage teachers to share these programmes with their students as a productive activity to do in their spare time from home.

Cyber Discovery provider SANS Chief Technology Officer James Lyne said:

Cyber security is a fascinating field packed with opportunities for innovation and to make the online world more secure. It spans every part of society and has a huge role in our future security and technology prospects as a nation.

This is your chance to learn how to ‘forensicate’ like a digital Sherlock Holmes, close down vulnerabilities before the hackers find them, and break codes.

Teachers, parents, students - get online and take advantage of this wonderful opportunity amidst the unique and challenging situation our country faces right now.

CyberFirst provider QA Chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield said:

These initiatives from NCSC and DCMS are set to deliver a great summer of learning for young people across the UK. There is a shortage of digital skills in the UK and the CyberFirst programmes tackle this issue head on – and have the added benefit of keeping young minds active at this difficult time.

The road to the UK’s economic recovery from this pandemic will be built on the skills we learn at this time. That’s why it was critical that initiatives like CyberFirst were pivoted to virtual delivery, so they could go ahead as planned. We are proud to partner with the NCSC to deliver these fully virtual training programmes."

People should still go and get their COVID-19 vaccine when asked to do so.,Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency,14 March 2021,"Since this statement was published on 16 March, we have issued a further response. Please see our most current statement here: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-regulator-confirms-that-people-should-continue-to-receive-the-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca

The benefits of the vaccine in preventing COVID-19, with its associated risk of hospitalisation and death, far outweigh the risks of side effects. People should go and get their COVID-19 vaccine when asked to do so.

It is still the case that it has not been confirmed the reported blood clots were caused by the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca. Blood clots can occur naturally and are not uncommon.

Our role is to continually monitor safety during widespread use of a vaccine. We have in placea proactive strategyto do this. We also work closely with our public health and international partners in reviewing the effectiveness and impact of the vaccines to ensure the benefits continue to outweigh any possible side effects."

Multiple indicators show that flu activity has remained stable and within baseline levels this week.

Influenza positivity remained stable at 1.8% in week 46 compared to 1.8% in the previous week. This refers to the percentage of people who test positive among those with symptoms tested at sentinel“spotter”‘spotter’laboratories, reported through the Respiratory DataMart surveillance system.

Hospital admissions, including intensive care unit (ICU) and high dependency unit (HDU) admissions, remained within baseline levels this week.

The overall flu hospital admission for this week remained low at 0.39 per 100,000 population, compared to 0.29 per 100,000 last week.

Children aged under 5 years continue to have the highest level of hospital admissions, but this has decreased this week to a rate of 0.92 per 100,000 population.

The provisional proportion of people in England who have received the 2023 to 2024 influenza vaccine in targeted groups is as follows:

COVID-19 activity decreased in almost all indicators this week.

COVID-19 positivity decreased to 5.8% in week 46 compared to 6.6% in the previous week. This refers to the percentage of people who test positive among those with symptoms tested at sentinel“spotter”‘spotter’laboratories, reported through the Respiratory DataMart surveillance system.

COVID-19 hospitalisations decreased to 2.7 per 100,000 population this week compared to 2.8 per 100,000 in the previous week. Hospitalisations were highest in the group of those aged 85 years and over at 25.9 per 100,000 population.

COVID-19 case rates and positivity rates through Pillar 1 decreased in most age groups, regions and ethnic groups in this week with a weekly mean positivity rate of 8.1% compared to 9.2% in the previous week.

ICUandHDUadmission rates for this week’s report remained low and stable.

Hospital admission rates have continued to decrease in most age groups.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the North West at 3.62 per 100,000 population this week.

A total of 7,482,634 people aged over 65 years in England have been vaccinated with an autumn 2023 COVID-19 booster dose since 1 September 2023, totalling 67.0% of that population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes atUKHSA, said:

In our weekly surveillance report, flu levels remain stable. We continue to monitor the data closely, and we expect to see an increase in the coming weeks as we approach flu season. This week, once again we see a continued decrease in COVID-19 activity.

If you are showing signs of a respiratory illness, we advise avoiding mixing with others where possible, particularly those who are more vulnerable, to help stop the spread of viruses like flu and COVID-19.

Vaccination is the best protection against flu and COVID-19, get winter strong andbook your flu and COVID-19 vaccinationsonline.

During weeks 44 and 45, norovirus laboratory reports remained 31% lower than the 5-season average of the same period.

Overall, the total number of reported enteric virus (all suspected or confirmed as norovirus) outbreaks reported during weeks 44 and 45 remained lower than the 5-season average for the same 2-week period. The majority of outbreaks (56%) were in care home settings. From week 44 to 45 the number of outbreaks reported in educational settings more than doubled.

Amy Douglas, Norovirus Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

It’s really important we take steps to try and stop the spread of norovirus. If you or a family member have been sick with norovirus, you should avoid visiting hospitals and care homes, and not return to work or school, until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped.

Hand gels do not kill norovirus, so handwashing with soap and warm water is best. Using bleach-based products to clean surfaces will also help stop the virus from spreading.

Make sure to drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration which can result in hospitalisation, particularly for the most vulnerable.

A total 65.8% (7,341,043 out of 11,164,326) of all people aged over 65 years who are living and resident in England have been vaccinated with an autumn 2023 COVID-19 booster dose since 1 September 2023.

Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, Consultant Epidemiologist for Immunisation atUKHSAsaid:

Our weekly surveillance shows flu levels remain generally stable, although we are now starting to see a slight increase in cases among young children. We will continue to monitor these rates closely as we approach the winter period, where we expect to see a rise in prevalence. This week, once again we see a decrease in COVID-19 activity.

We remind people that if you are experiencing symptoms of a respiratory illness, you should avoid mixing with others where possible to stop the spread of viruses like flu and COVID-19.

Heading into winter, the flu vaccine continues to offer the best protection against what can be a very severe illness for the more vulnerable, including pregnant women as well as those aged 2 and 3 years who are all eligible for a free NHS vaccine. You canbook your flu and COVID-19 vaccinations and check your eligibility online.

Norovirus laboratory reports decreased in recent weeks and during the 2-week period of the 2023 to 2024 season (weeks 43 and 44) were 21% lower than the 5-season average of the same period.

Overall, the total number of reported enteric virus (all suspected or confirmed as norovirus) outbreaks reported during weeks 43 and 44 remained lower than the 5-season average for the same 2-week period. The majority of outbreaks (63%) were in care home settings.

Amy Douglas, Norovirus Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

While norovirus cases are still low, we expect cases to rise as festive season gets underway. It’s really important we take steps to try and stop the spread. If you or a family member have been sick with norovirus, you should avoid visiting hospitals and care homes, and not return to work or school, until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the North West at 4.16 per 100,000 population this week.

A total 63.2% (7,050,519 out of 11,164,326) of all people aged over 65 years who are living and resident in England have been vaccinated with an autumn 2023 COVID-19 booster dose since 1 September 2023.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes atUKHSA, said:

Our weekly surveillance shows flu levels remain stable, but in the coming weeks as we approach winter, we expect this to change and will continue to monitor these rates closely. This week once again we see a decrease in COVID-19 infection rates.

We remind people that if you show signs of respiratory symptoms, you should avoid mixing with others where possible to stop the spread of viruses like flu and COVID-19.

Getting vaccinated before we reach peak flu season offers the best protection. We are beginning to see hospitalisations for flu among children under 5, and some children can become severely ill from flu. Most children aged 2 and 3 can get a nasal spray flu vaccine. You canbook your flu and COVID-19 vaccination, and check your eligibility online.

Norovirus laboratory reports have remained low in recent weeks. During the 2-week period of the 2023 to 2024 season (weeks 42 and 43), they were 12% lower than the 5-season average of the same period.

Overall, the total number of reported enteric virus (all suspected or confirmed as norovirus) outbreaks reported during weeks 42 and 43 remained lower than the 5-season average for the same 2-week period. The majority of outbreaks (53%) were in care home settings.

Amy Douglas, Norovirus Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

While norovirus cases are still low, we expect levels to rise as we head into winter. It’s really important we take steps to try and stop the spread. If you or a family member have been sick with norovirus, you should avoid visiting hospitals and care homes, and not return to work or school, until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped.

Hand gels do not kill norovirus, so handwashing with soap and warm water is best. Using bleach-based products to clean surfaces will also help stop the virus from spreading.

Make sure to drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration which can result in hospitalisation, particularly for the most vulnerable.

The overall positivity (amongst people with symptoms tested at sentinel ‘spotter’ laboratories) forRSVincreased to 8.7%, with the highest positivity in those aged under 5 years at 34.1%.

Emergency departments attendances for acute bronchiolitis continued to increase nationally, as well as hospital admission rates.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

UKHSAsurveillance this week is showing further increases inRSVandRSVbronchiolitis in young children in laboratory testing and hospital emergency departments. While usually mild,RSVinfection can cause breathing difficulties in babies and the elderly. Initial symptoms in infants are similar to a cold but can go on to include breathing more quickly or noisily and having difficulties feeding.

If your baby has a cold that is getting worse, or it is causing unusual breathing or problems feeding, call NHS 111 or contact your GP practice. As a parent, you should trust your own judgement and call 999 or go to A&E if your child seems seriously unwell.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes atUKHSA, said:

In this week’s surveillance report, flu activity currently remains stable but as we approach the winter season we expect to see rates increase over the next few weeks. We continue to monitor rates closely and remind people that when you show signs of respiratory symptoms, you should avoid mixing with others where possible – this will help to combat the spread of viruses like flu and COVID-19. COVID-19 infection rates continue to decrease.

We launched our‘get winter strong’ campaignthis week, targeting those eligible but still unvaccinated to come forward and join the millions protected ahead of the festive season. It is always best to get vaccinated before we reach peak flu season and see a possible increase in COVID-19 cases throughout the colder months.Book your flu and COVID-19 vaccination onlinewhile cases remain low, as this will give you the best protection against flu and COVID-19.

You can also use the NHS website to check if you are eligible for either, or both vaccines. If you have had any changes in your health or recently begun to live, care or work with vulnerable people it might be worth checking to see if you are eligible.

Norovirus laboratory reports decreased in recent weeks and during the 2-week period of the 2023 to 2024 season (weeks 41 and 42) were 20% lower than the 5-season average of the same period.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes atUKHSA, said:

This week’s surveillance indicates a slight increase in COVID-19 infection rates. As we enter the colder months and people begin to mix more indoors, we can expect to see further increases in COVID-19 alongside the usual increases we see in other winter respiratory viruses like flu. We are monitoring rates closely and reminding people that when you have respiratory symptoms you should avoid mixing with others, especially those more vulnerable.

NewUKHSAsurveillance published today shows the autumn 2022 COVID-19 booster prevented around 14,400 people having to be hospitalised. This shows clearly the overwhelming benefits for those most vulnerable in getting their COVID-19 jab as soon as possible this autumn.

It’s reassuring to see that 35.3% of those aged 65 and older have already taken up the offer of a COVID-19 jab.

And our flu campaign this autumn has got off to a great start with vaccination rates across all at-risk groups up on last year.

Heading into winter the flu vaccine offers the best protection against what can be a very severe illness for the more vulnerable, which includes pregnant women as well as 2 and 3 year olds who are all eligible for a free NHS vaccine. Tragically every year we see far too many unvaccinated young children severely ill with flu being hospitalised.

We strongly urge parents and allthose eligible, for either COVID-19 and flu vaccines or both, tobook today with the NHSor via their GP surgery as soon as possible.

The overall positivity for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) increased slightly to 3.3%, with the highest positivity in those aged under 5 years old at 14.9%. Emergency department attendances for acute bronchiolitis increased nationally.

In this week’s report, we see multiple indicators point to the stabilisation of COVID-19 rates. We have also seen a decrease in hospitalisation in those aged over 75 compared to 2 weeks ago since our last report. While this is good news, we will continue to remain vigilant and monitor rates closely.

TheNHS booking system for the COVID-19 vaccineis now live. We urgeeveryone eligibleto come forward to boost their protection, and to keep the vulnerable around them safe this winter. Vaccination continues to provide the best protection against serious illness and hospitalisation from COVID-19.

The overall flu hospital admission rate decreased in week 14 and is within baseline activity levels. Influenza admission rates declined or stayed low in all age groups.

There were no confirmed influenza outbreaks reported in England.

Swab positivity for flu* remained low and stable** at 1.4% compared to 1.6% the previous week, with the highest positivity seen in the group of those aged 15 to 44 years at 4.7%.

Influenza B continues to make up a majority of detections in surveillance systems.

*The percentage of people who test positive among those with symptoms tested at sentinel ‘spotter’ laboratories, reported through the Respiratory Datamart surveillance system.

**Influenza activity bands are set using aninternational standard method.

Most people have some immunity to influenza B so it is typically considered to be milder than influenza A. For those with less immunity – like children who have not encountered flu B before and not been vaccinated against flu – it can be as severe as influenza A.

Mid-season analysis byUKHSAand partner public health agenciesshows that children vaccinated against flu this year have good protection against the circulating influenza B.

In weeks 12 and 13, laboratory reports of norovirus were 68% higher than the 5-season average pre-COVID-19 (2014/2015 to 2018/2019). However, the number of laboratory reports has decreased each week over the 4 week period of weeks 10 to 13 in 2023.

The number of reported enteric virus (EV) outbreaks remained below pre-pandemic levels during weeks 10 to 13, with reports 29% lower than the 5-season average for the same 3-week period prior to the pandemic.

The majority ofEVoutbreaks in weeks 10 and 13 were reported in care home settings.

If anyone is concerned about their symptoms, contact NHS 111, talk to your GP by phone or visit theNHS norovirus webpagefor more information. Please try not to visit healthcare premises if you have symptoms.

Lesley Larkin, Head of Surveillance Scientist for Gastrointestinal Infections and Food Safety Division atUKHSA, said:

We are continuing to see most outbreaks being reported in care homes meaning it’s important to continue to take steps to try and stop norovirus spreading. Norovirus causes vomiting and diarrhoea so if you or a family member are experiencing any of these symptoms, you should avoid visiting hospitals and care homes, and not return to work or school, until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped.

Hand gels do not kill norovirus, so handwashing with soap and warm water is always best. Using bleach-based products to clean surfaces will also help stop the virus from spreading.

Make sure to drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration which can result in hospitalisation; this is particularly important for vulnerable groups such as the very young, elderly or immunocompromised.

COVID-19 case rates decreased in week 13 in most age groups, regions, and ethnic groups. Data from Respiratory Datamart suggests that SARS-CoV-2 positivity has decreased to 9.2% compared to 10.9% in the previous week.

The overall COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 13 was 8.4 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 9.4 per 100,000 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the North East for the sixth consecutive week, with a rate of 12.7 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 14.5 per 100,000 in week 12.

Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, Consultant Epidemiologist for Immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

Those aged 75 and over are still by far the largest group admitted to hospital due to severe illness from COVID-19. With the spring booster now available, I encourage everyone aged over 75, and anyone else who is eligible, to come forward and strengthen their protection by taking up the vaccine as soon as they are offered it.

The overall flu hospital admission rate decreased in week 13 around the threshold between baseline and low activity levels. Influenza admission rates declined or stayed low in all age groups.

You can help stop the spread of respiratory viruses by washing your hands regularly and avoiding others if you feel unwell, particularly those who are more vulnerable.

In weeks 11 and 12, laboratory reports of norovirus were 68% higher than the 5-season average pre-COVID-19 (2014/2015 to 2018/2019) with the highest levels of reporting in the groups of those aged over 65 years and those aged under 5 years.

The number of reported enteric virus (EV) outbreaks (all suspected or confirmed as norovirus) remained below pre-pandemic levels during weeks 10 and 11, with reports 34% lower than the 5-season average for the same 2-week period prior to the pandemic.

The majority ofEVoutbreaks in weeks 11 and 12 were reported in care home settings; however, outbreaks reported in hospital settings have also increased in recent weeks.

Norovirus cases are still very high – particularly in those aged 65 and over and in under 5s and we continue to see most outbreaks reported in care homes. Therefore, it’s really important to take steps to try and stop the virus spreading.

Norovirus symptoms include vomiting and diarrhoea. If you or a family member have norovirus symptoms, you should avoid visiting hospitals and care homes, and not return to work or school, until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped.

Hand gels do not kill norovirus, so handwashing with soap and warm water is best. Using bleach-based products to clean surfaces will also help stop the virus from spreading.

Make sure to drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration which can result in hospitalisation; this is particularly important for vulnerable groups such as the very young, elderly or immunocompromised.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) case rates through pillar one (6,466 cases) decreased or remained stable in week 12, in most age groups, most regions, and ethnic groups. Through Respiratory Datamart, SARS-CoV-2 positivity has decreased to 10.0% compared to 10.9% previous week. Pillar 2: 19,998 cases at 6.1% positivity.

Hospital admission rates have decreased in almost all age groups. The highest admission rates continue to be seen in people aged 75 years and over, with those aged 75 to 84 years at 45.5 per 100,000 population and those aged 85 years and over at 113.56 per 100,000.

The overall COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 12 was 9.38 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 10.44 per 100,000 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 continue to be the highest in the North East for the fifth consecutive week, with a rate of 13.65 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 16.38 per 100,000 in week 11.

Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, consultant epidemiologist for immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

Older people, aged 75 years and over, continue to be by far the largest group admitted to hospital due to severe illness from COVID-19.  With the spring booster set to be rolled out by the NHS very soon, I would encourage all aged over 75 years and others who are eligible to come forward and top up their protection as soon as possible when offered.

The overall flu hospital admission rate remained stable in week 12 around the threshold between baseline and low activity levels.

Influenza admission rates declined or stayed low in all age groups. There were no confirmed influenza outbreaks reported.

Swab positivity for flu* remained low and stable** at 1.5%, compared to 2.0% the previous week, with highest positivity seen in the group of those aged 15 to 44 years at 4.2%.

Influenza B continues to make up a majority of detections in surveillance systems.

*The percentage of people who test positive among those with symptoms tested at sentinel ‘spotter’ laboratories, reported through the Respiratory Datamart surveillance system.

**Influenza activity bands are set using aninternational standard method.

Most people have some immunity to influenza B so it is typically considered to be milder than influenza A. For those with less immunity – like children who have not encountered flu B before and not been vaccinated against flu – it can be as severe as influenza A.

Mid-season analysis byUKHSAand partner public health agenciesshow that children vaccinated against flu this year have good protection against the circulating influenza B.

Dr Conall Watson, consultant epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

Flu levels have now fallen to much lower than the winter peak with vaccination being critical in reducing the impact of flu.

Low-levels of the flu type B virus is still circulating. For children without immunity, flu B can be as severe as flu type A and parents should be alert for any symptoms, such as fever, cough and tiredness. Contact 111 if you have any concerns.

Everyone can help stop the spread of respiratory viruses by washing your hands regularly and avoiding others if you feel unwell, particularly those who are more vulnerable.

In weeks 10 and 11, laboratory reports of norovirus were almost double the 5-season average pre-COVID-19 (2014/2015 to 2018/2019) with the highest levels of reporting in those aged over 65 years and in the under 5 years age group.

The number of reported enteric virus (EV) outbreaks (all suspected or confirmed as norovirus) remained below pre-pandemic levels during weeks 10 and 11, with reports 28% lower than the 5-season average for the same 2-week period prior to the pandemic.

The majority ofEVoutbreaks in weeks 10 and 11 were reported in care home settings, with the highest number of outbreaks reported since the beginning of the pandemic during week 10.

If anyone is concerned about their symptoms, contact NHS 111, talk to your GP by phone or visit theNHS norovirus webpagefor more information, but please try not to visit healthcare premises if you have symptoms.

Hospital admission rates among those aged 75 years and over for coronavirus (COVID-19) remain relatively high, with a further increase this week in rates among those aged over 85 years at 132 per 100,000, up from 123 the previous week.

There were also slight increases in hospital admissions among those aged between 15 and 74 years in week 11.

The overall COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 11 was 10.62 per 100,000 population, an increase from 10.14 per 100,000 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 continue to be the highest in the North East, with a rate of 16.38 per 100,000 population.

Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, consultant epidemiologist for immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

COVID-19 hospitalisation rates among the over 75s continue to be high, with further increases among the over 85s. Vulnerability increases with age, which is why everyone over the age of 75 will be offered a spring COVID-19 booster through the NHS next month. I would encourage everyone who is eligible to come forward and top up their protection when they are called.

Everyone can help stop the spread of respiratory viruses by washing your hands regularly and avoiding others if you feel unwell, particularly those who are more vulnerable.

In week 11, in most indicators influenza activity remained stable at low levels. Following the high activity at the end of 2022, influenza type A has declined but influenza B circulation has continued and it now makes up the majority of detections in surveillance systems.

Swab positivity for flu* remained low and stable at 1.6%, compared to 1.9% the previous week, with highest positivity seen in the group of those aged 15 to 44 years at 4.2%.

The overall influenza hospital admission rate remained stable in week 11 around the threshold between  baseline and low activity levels. There have been some increases seen in admissions among children aged under 5 years. Some increases were also seen in critical care admission rates.**

We are continuing to monitor for late season influenza type B activity including hospital admission rates in children. Young children can be vulnerable to flu at any time of year and parents are advised to keep an eye out for symptoms and contact 111 if you have any concerns.

Rates of in-person contact (meeting with people from outside of the household) for week 7 of 2023 continue to resemble the rates seen in November to mid-December 2022 (source:UKHSAFluSurvey).

This week, monthly data which covered vaccinations that were given between 1 September and 31 January 2023 for GP patients, frontline healthcare workers and school aged children has been published for the fifth time this season and comparator data is available for previous seasons.

For pregnant women, when grouped by ethnicity, the highest vaccine uptake was seen in the Chinese group, some White (British and Irish) and some Asian (Indian, any other Asian background and mixed White and Asian) groups, with the lowest uptake seen in some Black ethnicities (Caribbean, Mixed White and Black Caribbean, any other Black background).

For primary school-aged children, uptake is comparable at this timepoint in the season to last season, but below that seen in the 2020 to 2021 season (which saw the highest on record for primary school-aged children).

Across a number of surveillance systems, the majority of influenza detections in the most recent week have been influenza B, though still at low levels.

Flu hospital admission rates continue to fall, but we are still in winter and we could still see increases yet. If you are at high risk of developing serious illness from flu, you should book your vaccine soon.

There are simple actions that we can all take to prevent COVID-19 and flu spreading. If you are unwell, please try to stay at home and don’t visit vulnerable people. This will also help to reduce transmission of norovirus, the most common cause of diarrhoea and vomiting, which is on the rise. If you do have to leave the house, please consider wearing a face covering, which can help prevent you passing respiratory viruses on.

RSVoverall swab positivity* decreased to 2.1%.

In week 5, the overall hospital admission rate decreased forRSVto 0.60 per 100,000.

*Among people with symptoms tested at sentinel ‘spotter’ laboratories, reported through the Respiratory Datamart surveillance system.

Laboratory reports of norovirus were 66% higher than the 5-season average pre-COVID-19 (2014/2015 to 2018/2019).

The number of reported enteric virus (EV) outbreaks remained below pre-pandemic levels during weeks 3 and 4, with reports 43% lower than the 5-season average for the same 2-week period prior to the pandemic.

The majority of outbreaks in weeks 3 and 4 were reported in care home settings.

If anyone is concerned about their symptoms, contact NHS 111 or talk to their GP by phone or visit theNHS norovirus webpagefor more information.

Dr Lesley Larkin, Surveillance Lead, Gastrointestinal Infections and Food Safety (One Health) Division at the UK Health Security Agency, said:

Norovirus levels are currently the highest we have seen at this time of year in over a decade. Most reported cases are in those aged over 65 years and we’re also seeing a rise in reported outbreaks, particularly in care home settings. Please stay at home if you are experiencing norovirus symptoms and do not return to work (particularly if you work with vulnerable people or food) or send sick children to school or nursery until 48 hours after symptoms have cleared. If you have a loved one in a care home or hospital, please avoid visiting until 48 hours after symptoms have cleared.

Regular hand washing is really important to help stop the spread of this bug, but remember, alcohol gels do not kill off norovirus so soap and warm water is best.

Swab positivity for flu* has decreased to 2.7% in week 4, compared to 3.0% in week 3. The highest positivity is seen in those aged 15 to 44 years at 5.8%, an increase from 4.6% in week 3.

Hospital admission rates decreased in the last week and are at low activity levels. Intensive care units (ICU) and high dependency units (HDU) hospital admission rates have also decreased, and are within baseline range of activity levels**.

Flu vaccine uptake is comparable to the previous 2021 to 2022 season in a number of cohorts, with 79.4% of those aged 65 years and over having received their flu vaccine, exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) target.

For pregnant women, vaccine uptake is 34.6%, and for those aged under 65 years in a clinical risk group, it is 48.4%.

Vaccine uptake in those aged 2 and 3 years (41.6% and 44.3% respectively) is below that seen in the previous 2 seasons, but broadly comparable to the 2018 to 2019 pre-pandemic season.

Rates of in-person contact (meeting with people from outside of the household) for week 4 of 2023 have come back up to rates seen in November to mid-December 2022 (source:UKHSAFluSurvey).UKHSAcontinues to monitor flu signal as more people return to work and school.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist at theUKHSA, said:

The NHS has delivered more than 20 million flu vaccines this winter and this will undoubtedly have spared many thousands from severe illness or hospitalisation and saved countless lives.

While flu levels continue to fall, winter is not over yet and we need to guard against further surges. Vaccine uptake among those aged 2 and 3 years is still well below the past 2 seasons and the number of pregnant women not taking up the offer is also a concern.

Vaccination is our best defence against flu. For pregnant women, it can protect both you and your baby against potentially serious complications, and young children are also vulnerable to serious illness. If you or your children are eligible it’s still not too late to get vaccinated.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) activity shows a mixed picture – with some indicators, most notably hospitalisations and Pillar 2 positivity suggesting a modest increase in activity.

The COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 4 was 6.61 per 100,000 population, a small increase from 5.94 per 100,000 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the South East, with a rate of 8.67 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

It’s concerning that the recent downward trend in COVID-19 hospitalisations has started to show signs of a reverse this week. Older people are still at the highest risk of being hospitalised for COVID-19, so it’s vital those eligible get their autumn/winter booster jab – come forward before Sunday 12 February when the offer comes to an end. It will top up your immunity and keep you protected.

Two variants, CH.1.1 and XBB.1.5, have a growth advantage in the UK and we can expect further increases in transmission and hospitalisations in future weeks.

There are simple actions we can all take to prevent viruses spreading. Washing your hands regularly, catching coughs and sneezes in tissues and if possible letting fresh air into rooms and spaces will all help. If you or your child is unwell please don’t visit vulnerable people, and try to stay at home. If you do have to go out when you’re unwell, consider wearing a face covering which can help prevent you passing viruses on.

Richard Elson, Head of Risk Assessment and Response, Gastrointestinal Infections and Food Safety (One Health) Division at theUKHSA, said:

Laboratory reports of norovirus are almost a third higher than we would typically see at this time of year, with cases highest in those aged over 65 years. Outbreaks in care homes have also been increasing. It is incredibly important at this time not to visit places with vulnerable people such as hospitals or care homes if you have norovirus symptoms.

One of the best ways to protect yourself against norovirus is by practising good hand hygiene. This includes thorough hand washing with soap and warm water regularly but especially after using the toilet or an episode of illness and before eating or preparing food. Most people will make a full recovery within 2 to 3 days but it is important to drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration, especially in the very young, elderly or those with weakened immune systems.

If you or your child does catch norovirus, you should not go to work (especially if you work with food or vulnerable people), or send your sick children back to school and don’t visit hospitals or care homes until at least 48 hours after symptoms have cleared. Make sure to wash hands and disinfect all surfaces after any episode of illness. Taking these steps will help you stop passing the virus on.

Swab positivity for flu* has decreased to 2.8% in week 3, compared to 6.5% in week 2. The highest positivity is seen in those aged 5 to 14 years and in those aged 15 to 44 years at 4.5%.

Hospital admission rates decreased in the last week and are at low activity levels. Intensive care units (ICU) and high dependency units (HDU) hospital admission rates have also decreased, and approached the baseline range of activity levels**.

Hospital admission rates have decreased across all ages, most notably in adults aged 85 and over (down to 4.9 this week from 26.3 per 100,000 the previous week) and in those aged 75 to 84 years (down to 4.2 this week from 8.5 per 100,000 the previous week). Hospitalisations among children under the age of 5 years are currently the highest among age groups but have decreased (5.4 per 100,000 down from 6.0 last week).

Flu vaccine uptake is comparable to the previous 2021 to 2022 season in a number of cohorts, with 79.2% of those aged 65 years and over having received their flu vaccine, exceeding the World Health Organization target.

For pregnant women, vaccine uptake is 34.3%, and for those under 65 years in a clinical risk group, it is 48.1%.

Vaccine uptake in those aged 2 years and 3 years (41.3% and 43.9% respectively) is below that seen in the previous 2 seasons, but broadly comparable to the 2018 to 2019 pre-pandemic season.

Hospital admissions for flu are still highest in the under 5s so if your children are eligible, it’s still not too late to get them vaccinated. Older people are still at the highest risk of being hospitalised for COVID-19, so it’s vital those eligible get their booster jab.

Now is the time to come forward for a COVID-19 booster if you haven’t already – whether it’s your first or if you’re eligible for an autumn booster. Come forward before Sunday 12 February, when the offer comes to an end. It will top up your immunity and keep you and your loved ones protected.

Delivering more than 20 million flu vaccines is an important milestone and this will undoubtedly have spared many thousands from severe illness or hospitalisation and saved countless lives.

Flu continues to be a serious health threat this winter. If you or your children are eligible it’s still not too late to get vaccinated, to protect yourselves and those around you – and help reduce NHS pressures.

Flu vaccination gives vital protection, but there are other simple actions we can all take to prevent viruses spreading.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the North East, with a rate of 13.18 per 100,000 population.

Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, Consultant Epidemiologist for Immunisation and Countermeasures atUKHSA, said:

These early signs that COVID-19 infection levels may be in decline are encouraging and welcome, but we cannot be complacent. Today’s data shows we’re heading in the right direction but COVID-19 is still circulating at high levels and hospital admissions remain high in the oldest age groups (117.3 in those 85s and over), so it is particularly important that everyone who is eligible continues to come forward to accept their booster jab.

While COVID-19 is a mild illness for many, we must not forget that it can cause severe illness or even death for those most vulnerable in our communities. COVID-19 is still circulating at high levels, so do take up your vaccine if you are offered it.

Following some simple steps can help keep us safe from different winter illnesses in circulation. If you are unwell this winter, please try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people, particularly elderly or vulnerable people  – this will help stop infection from spreading. If you are unwell but have to go out, please consider wearing a face covering and practise good hand hygiene to limit spread.

Dame Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

In the week leading up to Christmas, we saw a dramatic increase in the number of people admitted to hospital with flu, with the highest levels of hospital admissions we’ve seen in at least a decade. Admissions were particularly high in the under 5s and those 65 and over.

I urge all those eligible to come forward for their free flu vaccination, which is the best way to protect yourself from serious illness. Uptake of the flu vaccine is particularly low in children aged  2 and 3 so if your child is eligible please urgently take up the offer.

COVID-19 also continues to circulate at high levels and anyone eligible for a booster who has yet to take it up should come forward.

Frequent handwashing with soap and warm water, catching coughs and sneezes in tissues and keeping your home well ventilated can also help stop viruses from spreading.

Try to stay home when unwell and if you do have to go out, wearing a face covering can help prevent germs spreading to other people. Don’t visit vulnerable people if you’re unwell.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

RSVcan be most severe for children under 2 – and particularly nasty for babies and those born prematurely. Please carry on with good hygiene habits to protect yourself and others from common seasonal illnesses. This means washing your hands regularly, using a tissue to catch coughs or sneezes and washing your hands afterwards, and staying away from others if you feel unwell.

If you are concerned your child has cold symptoms with unusual breathing or has trouble feeding, please contact your GP or NHS 111. If your child seems seriously ill, trust your judgement and get emergency care.

If you do catch norovirus, do not go to work (especially if you work with food or vulnerable people), send children back to school or visit hospitals or care homes until at least 48 hours after symptoms have cleared. This will help you stop passing the virus on.

Swab positivity for flu* has increased further and is now at 26.4%; it remains highest in 5 to 14-year-olds at 40.1%.

Hospital admission rates and intensive care admission rates have increased further in the last week. Hospital admissions have continued to increase sharply within the medium band and intensive care activity remains at medium activity levels**.

Admission rates have increased significantly in adults aged 85 and over (up to 42.04 this week from 25.40 per 100,000 the previous week) and those aged 75 to 84 (up to 19.00 this week from 11.81 per 100,000 the previous week). Hospitalisations among children under the age of 5 also remain high (19.42 per 100,000, down from 21.16 last week).

Flu vaccine uptake is comparable to the previous 2021 to 2022 season in a number of cohorts, with more than 77.9% of 65-year-olds and over having received their flu vaccine, exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) target.

For pregnant women, vaccine uptake is 32.4%, and for those under 65 years in a clinical risk group, it is 45.5%.

Vaccine uptake in 2 and 3-year-olds (38.8% and 40.9% respectively) is below that seen in the previous 2 seasons, but broadly comparable to the 2018 to 2019 pre-pandemic season.

Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

Hospitalisations have increased dramatically in those aged 75 and over in the past week, with admissions among children under 5 remaining high.ICUadmissions have also increased this week.

NHS services are already under pressure so it’s more important than ever to get protected with the flu vaccine and help keep yourself out of hospital.

Most children aged 2 and 3 can get a nasal spray flu vaccine through their GP surgery. If you are pregnant or in a clinical risk group, you are also at greater risk, so it is even more important you take up the offer. Anyone over 50 can get a free flu or COVID-19 booster vaccine which can bebooked online.

We can all take actions to stop flu and other infections spreading, if you feel unwell try to stay home, and if you have to go out – wear a face covering in enclosed spaces. Wash your hands regularly and try to keep rooms well ventilated.

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has increased across all indicators in week 50 of 2022.

The COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 50 was 9.56 per 100,000 population, an increase from 6.61 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the South West, with a rate of 15.21 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes atUKHSA, said:

We are seeing a rise in cases and hospital admissions for both flu and COVID-19 as people continue to mix indoors this winter. Hospitalisation rates due to COVID-19 remain highest in those aged 65 and over, so it is vital that everyone who is eligible continues to come forward to accept their booster jab before the end of the year.

Both COVID-19 and flu can cause severe illness or even death for those most vulnerable in our communities, and so it is also important to avoid contact with other people if you are unwell in order to help stop infections spreading over the Christmas and new year period.

RSVoverall swab positivity* decreased to 6.5% in, with positivity in those aged under 5 at 15.9%.

RSVadmissions for the under 5s have also dropped but remain high. Hospital emergency departments continue to see many infants for bronchiolitis caused byRSVinfection.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

RSVcan be more severe for children under 2 – and sometimes particularly nasty for babies and those born prematurely. In the run up to Christmas, when the weather is getting colder, everyone should try and avoid spreading respiratory viruses to young children – use tissues, wash hands and avoid visiting babies if you are unwell.

If you are concerned your child has cold symptoms with unusual breathing or has trouble feeding, please contact your GP or NHS 111. If your child seems seriously ill, trust your judgement and get emergency care.

Laboratory reports of norovirus have remained lower than the 5-season average pre-COVID-19 (2014/2015 to 2018/2019) and were 9% lower in weeks 48 and 49.

The number of reported enteric virus (EV) outbreaks also remained below pre-pandemic levels during weeks 48 and 49, with reports 59% lower than the 5-season average for the same 2-week period prior to the pandemic.

Dr Lesley Larkin, Surveillance Lead, Gastrointestinal Infections and Food Safety (One Health) Division atUKHSA, said:

Norovirus is passed on by close contact with people with the infection, eating food contaminated with the virus or by touching surfaces where the virus has landed. Alcohol gels do not kill norovirus, so help stop the spread by washing your hands with soap and warm water after using the toilet and before preparing food. Make sure to wash hands and disinfect all surfaces after any episode of illness.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

Flu is now circulating widely and we have seen a sharp rise in the rate of hospitalisations for flu this week, particularly among the under 5s and over 85s.

Admissions are now at the highest point since the 2017 to 2018 season and we are expecting case numbers to continue increasing as we move further into winter.

The flu vaccine offers the best protection against severe illness and it’s not too late for everyone eligible to get it. Uptake is particularly low in those aged 2 and 3 so if your child is eligible please take up the offer.

COVID-19 activity showed a mixed picture in week 49 – with some surveillance indicators, most notably hospitalisations and care home outbreaks, suggesting a modest increase in activity.

The COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 49 was 6.61 per 100,000 population, a small increase from 5.36 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the South West, with a rate of 9.68 per 100,000 population.

Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, Consultant Epidemiologist for Immunisation and Countermeasures atUKHSAsaid:

We’re seeing rises in flu, COVID-19 and other winter viruses as people mix more indoors this winter. COVID-19 hospitalisations are highest in the oldest age groups, so it is particularly important that everyone who is eligible continues to come forward to accept their booster jab.

While COVID-19 and flu can be mild infections for many, we must not forget that they can cause severe illness or even death for those most vulnerable in our communities.

If you are unwell this winter, please try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people, particularly elderly or vulnerable people  – this will help stop infection from spreading.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

With winter now upon us, we are seeing flu circulating more widely. The NHS frontline has already delivered millions of vaccines to those most at risk from what can be a deadly virus. With Christmas fast approaching, if you are eligible and have not yet been vaccinated, it can take a fortnight or so for the flu vaccine to provide protection.

Nobody wants to see their loved ones be sick or in hospital with flu over Christmas, so to ensure your family are ready to enjoy the festive season together don’t hesitate and book your vaccine today.

Parents of children in eligible school years should make sure their kids take up the offer of flu nasal spray vaccine at the school session or in community catch-up clinics.

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in some indicators but was stable or increased slightly in others in week 48 of 2022.

The COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 48 was 5.45 per 100,000 population, a small increase from 4.51 in the previous week.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

Flu vaccine uptake among pregnant women and young children is low for this time of year. This is concerning given the expected reduced levels of natural immunity across the population following 2 winters with little flu.

Getting the vaccine when you are pregnant can protect you and your baby against potentially serious complications.

It can take a couple of weeks to build up full immunity after the vaccine so it is important to book yours as soon as possible to get protected in time for the festive season.

Parents of children in eligible school years should make sure their kids take up the offer of flu nasal spray vaccine at the school session or in community catch-up clinics.

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in most indicators in week 47 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) in care homes due to COVID-19 increased in England in week 47 to 83 compared to 49 in the previous week.

The COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 47 was 4.69 per 100,000 population, a small increase from 4.45 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates and intensive care admission rates have increased notably in the last week, to medium activity levels for intensive care and just below the medium activity threshold for admissions.

Flu vaccine uptake is comparable to the previous 2021 to 2022 season in a number of cohorts, but notably primary school children exceed previous records – with uptake numbers over 21% (receiving the nasal spray vaccine) between 1 September and 31 October. This is up 7% on the previous year and up to 3% higher than the previous record year (2018 to 2019).

More than 7 out of 10 over 65-year-olds have also received their flu vaccine.

*The percentage of people who test positive among those with symptoms tested at sentinel ‘spotter’ laboratories, reported through the Respiratory Datamart surveillance system.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

It’s encouraging to see record rates of primary school children getting their nasal spray flu vaccine so far this year with over 21% vaccinated by the end of October. Last week, 5 to 14-year-olds were the age most likely to test positive for flu so it’s still important for parents to ensure their children get the vaccine for the best protection. It will also help stop the spread to other more vulnerable family members, especially grandparents, very young children or those with health conditions. If you’ve missed the school vaccination appointment then there are NHS community clinics available.

It’s also great to see that more than 7 out of 10 over 65-year-olds have had their flu vaccine, ensuring they have the best protection as we head into winter. If you haven’t had your flu or COVID-19 vaccine and are over 50, pregnant or have a long term health condition there is still time, so make sure you book an appointment as soon as you can.

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in most indicators in week 46 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) decreased in England in week 46 to 122 compared to 123 in the previous week.

The COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 46 was 4.38 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 5.07 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the South East, with a rate of 5.48 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes atUKHSA, said:

The continued decline in COVID-19 cases across the country is reassuring. Declining hospitalisations in over 50s is also a result of so many people having come forward for their booster. We urge those who have not had their booster this autumn to do so as soon as possible. Vaccination remains the best way to protect yourself, your family and the NHS, particularly as we head into winter.

Hospital admission rates and intensive care admission rates remain stable overall at slightly above what would be expected for this time of year (baseline).

Vaccine uptake for flu is comparable to the previous 2021 to 2022 season in a number of cohorts: those aged 65 and over (71.9%), those under 65 years in clinical risk groups (37.2%) and for pregnant women (25.9%). Uptake is lower however in those aged 2 and 3 years old (27.9% and 29.7% respectively).

Children under 5 continue to be hospitalised with flu this autumn. Children aged 2 and 3 can be protected by an NHS flu vaccine, but the numbers getting what is a straightforward nasal spray vaccine are still low – less than 30%. As we go into winter we expect flu levels to increase. Nobody wants their child to get sick. I strongly urge parents to book with their local GP nurse as soon as possible.

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in most indicators in week 45 of 2022.

The number of reported enteric virus (EV) outbreaks have decreased during weeks 43 and 44 and overall remains 56% lower than the same period in the 5 seasons pre-COVID-19.

OverallEVoutbreaks in care homes and hospitals remain notably lower than during the same period in the 5 seasons pre-COVID-19. The overall reduction in reported outbreaks during the 2 week period compared to 5-season average is mostly due to the decrease reported in educational settings during week 43, and coincides with the October half term school holidays.

Dr Lesley Larkin, Head of surveillance, gastrointestinal infections and food safety atUKHSA, said:

Norovirus is passed on by close contact with people with the infection or touching surfaces that the virus has landed on. It is important to wash your hands with soap and warm water after using the toilet and before preparing food. Remember that alcohol gels do not kill norovirus. Disinfecting all surfaces after any episode of illness can help the spread of the virus.

If you do get norovirus, it is easy to become dehydrated, so drink plenty of fluids to prevent this. Those experiencing diarrhoea and vomiting should not return to work or send unwell children to school until at least 48 hours after symptoms have cleared. If anyone is concerned about their symptoms, contact NHS 111 or talk to their GP by phone or visit theNHS norovirus webpagefor more information.

Swab positivity for flu* has remained stable and is now at 6.6%; it is highest in 15 to 44-year-olds at 12.4%, followed by 5 to 14-year-olds at 11.2%.

Hospitalisation rates for flu are stable overall but are now slightly exceeding the baseline threshold for the first time this season. There is some week-to-week variability: the over 75s and under 5s remain the highest but have dropped, while rates in the 15 to 44-year-olds have increased. Intensive care admission rates remain above baseline. are highest in those aged 75 to 84 at 1.67 followed by those aged 85 and over at 1.49.

The hospitalisation rates in children aged 0 to 4 are 1.47. Intensive care admission rates remain above baseline.

Vaccine uptake for flu compared to the previous 2021 to 2022 season is comparable for those aged 65-year-olds and over (68%), for those under 65 years in clinical risk groups (33.7%) and for pregnant women (23.5%), but lower in those aged 2 and 3 years old (24% and 25.9% respectively).

*the percentage of people who test positive among those with symptoms tested at sentinel ‘spotter’ laboratories, reported through the Respiratory Datamart surveillance system.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

Hospitalisation rates for flu continue to be highest among those aged 75 and over but we are also seeing comparable rates in young children under 5. Older people are typically at higher risk of severe illness but young children can also become very sick so it’s important parents ensure their child gets the nasal spray vaccine by booking an appointment at their local GP.

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in most indicators in week 44 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) decreased in England in week 44 to 140 compared to 182 in the previous week.

The COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 44 was 5.41 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 7.71 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the North East, with a rate of 7.38 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes atUKHSA, said:

It is hugely encouraging that COVID-19 cases and hospitalisations are still in decline across the UK. This goes to show how effective the vaccine programme continues to be and we thank everyone who has come forward for their latest vaccination so far. However, it is still vital that anyone who has not had their booster this autumn does so as soon as possible. Vaccination is still the best way to protect yourself, your family and the NHS, particularly as we head into winter.

RSVoverall swab positivity* decreased slightly to 7.4% in week 44, with the highest positivity in under 5-year-olds remaining elevated at 29.3% and an increase in 5 to 14-year-olds.

*among people with symptoms tested at sentinel ‘spotter’ laboratories, reported through the Respiratory Datamart surveillance system.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist atUKHSA, said:

For most people,RSVmeans a common cold, but for children under 2,RSVcan be severe – particularly for babies and those born prematurely. Actions like using tissues to catch coughs and sneezes and handwashing afterwards can reduce the spread to the most vulnerable.

Never smoke near a baby and avoid seeing babies if you are ill.  If you are ill, do not visit babies and avoid smoking around your baby. If you are worried your child has cold symptoms with any unusual breathing or difficulty feeding, please contact your GP or NHS 111. If your child seems seriously ill, trust your judgement and get emergency care.

Laboratory reports of norovirus have decreased in recent weeks and were lower in weeks 42 and 43 than the 5-season average pre-COVID-19 (2014/2015 to 2018/2019).

The number of reported enteric virus (EV) outbreaks have decreased during weeks 42 and 43 and overall remains 52% lower than the same period in the 5 seasons pre-COVID-19.

Reports ofEVoutbreaks in care homes make up 69% of all outbreaks. The overall reduction in reported outbreaks during the 2 week period compared to 5-season average is mostly due to the decrease reported in educational settings during week 43, and coincides with the October half term school holidays.

Swab test positivity* for influenza has continued to increase and is now at 6.1%, it is highest in 15 to 44-year-olds at 13.4%, followed by 5 to 14-year-olds at 10.4%.

Hospitalisation rates for flu are highest in those aged 85 and over at 2.37 followed by those aged 75 to 84 at 1.63.

Vaccine uptake for flu compared to the previous 2021 to 2022 season is comparable for 65-year-olds and over, currently 64.3%. For those under 65 years in clinical risk groups, 29.9% and for pregnant women 20.7%, but lower in 2 and 3 years old, 20.3% and 21.8%.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist for the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

We’re now seeing flu spreading in all age groups over recent weeks. Children aged 2 to 3 may have little natural immunity to flu and can become severely ill. The recent flu season in Australia saw a high number of children hospitalised and there have already been intensive care admissions of young children in the UK. That is why we are urging parents to get their children vaccinated as soon as possible.

It is also important that schoolchildren get vaccinated as it not only protects them but also reduces the spread of flu. Again, parents should ensure they fill in the school consent form so their child is able to get the nasal spray through their school programme.

*among people with symptoms tested at sentinel ‘spotter’ laboratories, reported through the Respiratory Datamart surveillance system.

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in most indicators in week 43 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) decreased in England in week 43 to 182 compared to 280 in the previous week.

Positivity for pillar one laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases for week 43 was 9.0 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 11.7 in the previous week.

The COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 43 was 7.78 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 9.82 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the North East, with a rate of 11.49 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes atUKHSA, said:

The continued success of the vaccination programme means that COVID-19 cases and hospitalisation rates are still falling across the UK. This is excellent news, but we need to make sure that we remain protected through the winter. We are urging everyone to come forward and take up all the vaccine doses for which they are eligible as soon as possible.

RSVswab positivity* increased to 8.3% in week 43, with the highest positivity in under 5-year-olds at 29.3%.

Emergency department attendances for bronchiolitis (an infection of the small airways most commonly caused byRSV) in the under 1s have also increased, andRSVadmissions in the under 5s.

Learn more aboutRSVin our blog.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist forUKHSA, said:

Hospital attendances and admissions forRSVand bronchiolitis continue to rise in young children, in line with what we typically see at this time of year. For children under 2,RSVcan be severe – particularly for babies and those born prematurely.

WithRSVrising, actions like using tissues and handwashing can reduce spread to the most vulnerable. If you are ill, do not visit babies. If you are worried your infant has cold symptoms with any unusual breathing or difficulty feeding, please contact 111 or your GP. If your child seems seriously unwell, trust your judgement and get emergency care.

*among people with symptoms tested at sentinel ‘spotter’ laboratories, reported through the Respiratory Datamart surveillance system.

Laboratory reports of norovirus have started to increase in recent weeks and were comparable in weeks 41 and 42 to the 5-season average pre-COVID-19 (2014/2015 to 2018/2019).

The number of reported enteric virus (EV) outbreaks have been stable during weeks 41 and 42 but overall remains 32% lower than the same period in the 5 seasons pre-COVID-19.

Reports ofEVoutbreaks in care homes have increased by 50% from week 41 to 42 but have not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels.

Richard Elson, Principal Epidemiologist,UKHSA, said:

We are starting to see a rise in norovirus outbreaks in care homes. Help stop norovirus spreading in this vulnerable group by avoiding visits if you are unwell.

It is important to remember, alcohol gels don’t kill norovirus. The best way to protect yourself and others is to wash your hands with soap and warm water regularly and thoroughly, especially after illness or after using the toilet and before handling food.

If you are unlucky enough to become ill from the virus, drink plenty of fluids and don’t return to work or send sick children to school until at least 48 hours after symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting have stopped. This is particularly important if you work with food or with people who are very young or very old.

Positivity for flu has continued to increase and is now at 5.2%. It is the highest in 5 to 14-year-olds at 12% followed by 15 to 44-year-olds at 9.6%.

Hospitalisation rates for flu are highest in those aged 0 to 4 at 3.19 followed by those aged 85+ at 2.48 per 100,000.

Vaccine uptake for flu compared to the previous 2021 to 2022 season is comparable for 65-year-olds and over, currently 59%. For those under 65 years in clinical risk groups, 25.7% and for pregnant women 17.9%, but lower in 2 and 3 years old, 16% and 17.1%.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist for the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

Hospital admission rates for flu have increased in recent weeks and remain highest in those under 5. Already this year a small number of young children have needed intensive care. Please book your pre-schooler in for flu vaccine at your GP surgery as soon as you can.

Flu nasal spray vaccine is also currently being offered to all primary school children and will be available for some secondary school years later this season.

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, coronavirus (COVID-19) activity has decreased in most indicators in week 42 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) decreased in England in week 42 to 280 compared to 347 in the previous week.

Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases for week 42 was 10.2 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 12.8 in the previous week.

The COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 42 was 10.06 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 11.61 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the South West, with a rate of 14.08 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes atUKHSA, said:

The ongoing drop in COVID-19 cases and hospitalisation rates is a testament to the continued success of the autumn booster programme and it is hugely encouraging that 10 million people in England have already taken up their booster. However, it is vital that we do not become complacent as cases could rise quickly again throughout the winter and we need to be ready. Please come forward for your booster as soon as it is offered to you.

Vaccines remain our best protection against disease but it’s also important that we all remain cautious as we head into winter. If you have symptoms of a respiratory infection, it is important to avoid contact with elderly people or those who have underlying health conditions. This will not only help to keep you and your loved ones safe, but will go a long way to relieving the pressure on the NHS through the winter.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) swab positivity increased to 6.5% in week 42, with the highest positivity in children under 5, at 23.4%.

Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist forUKHSA, said:

RSVlevels are rising in young children as we head into winter. For children under 2RSVcan be severe – particularly for babies and those born prematurely, with a heart condition or chronic lung disease.

If you are ill, avoid visiting babies. Smoking around babies also increases their risk of severeRSVinfection. If you are worried your infant has cold symptoms causing any unusual breathing or difficulty feeding, please seek advice from 111 or your GP. If your child seems seriously unwell, trust your judgement and get emergency care.

Laboratory reports of norovirus have increased in recent weeks and were higher during weeks 40 and 41 than the 5-season average pre-COVID (year 2014 to 2015 to year 2018 to 2019).

The number of reported enteric virus (EV) outbreaks have been stable during weeks 40 and 41, but overall remains 33% lower than the same period in the 5 seasons pre-COVID.

Throughout the 2022 to 2023 season to date,EVoutbreaks have returned to comparable levels for the point in this season in educational settings compared to the same period in the 5 seasons pre-COVID and reports of outbreaks in hospital and care home settings have remained notably low.

Rotavirus laboratory reports are currently 22% higher than the 5-season average of the same 2-week period pre-COVID.

Dr Richard Elson, Principal Epidemiologist,UKHSA, said:

Norovirus activity is starting to increase as we head into winter. Alcohol gels don’t kill norovirus, so the best way to protect yourself and others is to wash your hands with soap and warm water regularly and thoroughly, especially after an episode of illness or after using the toilet and before handling food.

If you are unlucky enough to be struck down by the virus, drink plenty of fluids and don’t return to work or send sick children to school or nursery until at least 48 hours after symptoms including diarrhoea and vomiting have stopped. Please don’t visit loved ones in hospital or care homes, to help reduce the risk of outbreaks among those who are more vulnerable.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in most indicators in week 41 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) decreased in England in week 41 to 347 compared to 370 in the previous week.

Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases for week 41 was 11.0 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 13.9 in the previous week.

The COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 41 was 11.75 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 12.53 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the South West, with a rate of 15.96 per 100,000 population.

Cases of flu have climbed quickly in the past week, indicating that the season has begun earlier than normal. We are seeing hospitalisations andICUadmissions rising the fastest in children under 5.

Vaccination for flu is currently behind last season for pre-schoolers (12.1% in all 2 year olds and 12.8% in all 3 year olds) and pregnant women (12.4%) and under 65 in a clinical risk group (18.2%). This is compared to 17.4% in 2 year olds, 18.6% in 3 year olds, 15.7% in pregnant women and 20.7% in under 65s and in clinical risk groups last year.

Around 33 million people are eligible for the flu vaccine and 26 million people are eligible for the COVID-19 booster. Getting vaccinated is not just about protecting yourself but others around you, especially the more vulnerable groups.

Information on eligibilityfor the flu vaccine and COVID-19 booster is available.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency, said:

Our latest data shows early signs of the anticipated threat we expected to face from flu this season. We’re urging parents in particular not to be caught out as rates of hospitalisations andICUadmissions are currently rising fastest in children under 5. This will be a concern for many parents and carers of young children, and we urge them to take up the offer of vaccination for eligible children as soon as possible.

It’s possible that we’re already seeing the benefits from so many people taking up their COVID-19 autumn booster in England. Encouragingly, the latest data shows a small decrease in COVID-19 cases and hospitalisation rates over the past week. There’s no room for complacency though, as cases could rise again at any point and we need to be armed in readiness through vaccination of everyone who’s eligible. Don’t delay; please come forward for both COVID-19 and flu vaccinations as soon as you’re offered them.

Vaccines remain our best protection against severe disease and hospitalisation this winter but it’s also vital that we all remain cautious as we head into winter when people tend to mix more indoors and the risk increases. If you are feeling unwell, avoid contact with elderly people or those with underlying health conditions.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has increased in most indicators in week 40 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) increased in England in week 40 to 370 compared to 270 in the previous week.

Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 40 was 12.1 per 100,000 population, an increase from 11.7 in the previous week.

The hospital admission rate for week 40 was 12.60 per 100,000 population, an increase from 10.65 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the North East, with a rate of 15.84 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

We’re seeing sustained increases in COVID-19 cases and hospitalisation rates so we continue to urge those eligible for vaccinations to come forward, whether that’s a first dose or a booster. Vaccines are the best protection against severe disease and hospitalisation this winter and it’s never too late to take up your first dose. It’s fantastic to see that around 30% of those eligible have already come forward for their booster in such a short period of time.

There are early indications that deaths with COVID-19 have also started to rise. While this is concerning, it is too early to say whether these are deaths due to COVID-19 and it is reassuring that at this stage there is no overall excess mortality.

If you are unwell or have symptoms of a respiratory infection, it is particularly important to avoid contact with elderly people or those who are more likely to have severe disease because of their ongoing health conditions.

Wearing a face covering will also help stop respiratory infections spreading.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has increased in most indicators in week 39 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) increased in England in week 39 to 273 compared to 170 in the previous week; a 61% increase in suspected outbreaks.

Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 39 was 9.2 per 100,000 population, a 10% increase compared to the previous week.

The hospital admission rate for week 39 was 10.83 per 100,000 population, a 45% increase compared to the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the South West, with a rate of 16.67 per 100,000 population. This represents a 250% increase in the South West since mid-September, when there was a rate of 4.79 per 100,000 population.

Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

This week’s data shows concerning further increases in COVID-19 cases and hospitalisation rates, which are now at their highest level in months. Outbreaks in hospitals and care homes are also on the rise.

Make sure you have any COVID-19 vaccinations you are eligible for and avoid contact with others if you feel unwell or have symptoms of a respiratory infection.

If you are unwell, it is particularly important to avoid contact with elderly people or those who are more likely to have severe disease because of their ongoing health conditions.

If you have symptoms of a respiratory infection, wearing a face covering will also help stop infections spreading.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has increased in most indicators in week 38 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) increased in England in week 38 to 170 compared to 133 in the previous week.

Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 38 was 6.9 per 100,000 population, an increase from 5.5 in the previous week. There was a large increase in those aged over 80.

The hospital admission rate for week 38 was 7.62 per 100,000 population, an increase from 4.96 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the North East, with a rate of 10.82 per 100,000 population

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

It is clear now that we are seeing an increase which could signal the start of the anticipated winter wave of COVID-19 – so the time to boost your protection with a vaccine if you’re eligible is now. Cases have started to climb and hospitalisations are increasing in the oldest age groups.

In the coming weeks, we expect a double threat of low immunity and widely circulating flu and COVID-19, creating an unpredictable winter and additional pressure on health services. While COVID-19 and flu can be mild infections for many, we must not forget that they can cause severe illness or even death for those most vulnerable in our communities.

If you are unwell this winter, please try to stay at home and avoid contact with vulnerable people – this will help stop infections spreading.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has remained stable in most indicators in week 37 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) increased in England in week 37 to 133 compared to 131 in the previous week.

Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 37 was 4.6 per 100,000 population, a slight decrease from 5.1 in the previous week. There were small increases in those aged over 80.

The hospital admission rate for week 37 was 4.91 per 100,000 population, a slight decrease from 5.94 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the North East, with a rate of 7.19 per 100,000 population.

Our latest data, available through theCOVID-19 dashboard, is updated weekly on Thursdays at around 4pm and is the focus of the below quote.

Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor at the UK Health Security Agency, said:

While COVID-19 rates are still low, the latest data for the last 7 days indicate a rise in hospitalisations and a rise in positive tests reported from the community.

For those eligible, the time to get your autumn booster is now. Getting a booster will give your immune system time to build up your protection against being severely ill from COVID-19 as we move into winter.

All of the available boosters provide good protection against severe illness from COVID-19 and getting your booster sooner rather than later is crucial.

As it gets colder and we head towards winter, we will start to see respiratory infections pick up – please try to stay at home if you are unwell and avoid contact with vulnerable people.

The latestnational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reporthas been published.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in most indicators in week 35 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) increased in England in week 35 to 116 compared to 111 in the previous week.

Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 35 was 3.7 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 4.1 in the previous week.

The hospital admission rate for week 35 was 5.33 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 6.17 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the North East, with a rate of 6.71 per 100,000 population.

Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, consultant epidemiologist for immunisation and countermeasures at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

The latest COVID-19 indicators provide more positive news, as COVID-19 case rates and hospitalisations continue to decline.

However, with respiratory viruses increasing in circulation in the winter months we can expect to see growing cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. We urge all who are contacted to come forward and accept their booster when called for their jab. The NHS booking system is now open for immunosuppressed people and those aged over 75.

We also encourage everyone to keep helping to reduce the spread of the virus – meeting in well-ventilated spaces, washing hands regularly and staying away from others where possible if you have symptoms of a respiratory illness.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in most indicators in week 34 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) decreased in England in week 34 to 111 compared to 124 in the previous week.

Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 34 was 3.8 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 5.1 in the previous week.

The hospital admission rate for week 34 was 5.88 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 7.17 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the West Midlands, with a rate of 8.23 per 100,000 population.

Thelatest evidenceshows that vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation is similar for the BA.4/5 variants as it is for BA.2.

​In somebody who received their second dose around 6 months previously, a booster dose increases protection against hospitalisation by 50 to 60%. This is the most comprehensive analysis of vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation for BA.4/5 undertaken to date.

Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, consultant epidemiologist for immunisation and countermeasures at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

The latest COVID-19 indicators provide more positive news, with continued low levels of COVID-19 case rates and hospitalisations and a sustained downward trend.

The latest evidence shows vaccine effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against hospitalisation with the BA.4 and BA.5 variant is similar to the protection given for BA.2. The latest analysis shows getting a booster dose 6 or more months after your first 2 jabs increases protection against hospitalisation by around 60%.

The autumn booster will provide the best protection against COVID-19 this winter and we urge all those eligible – people aged 50 and over and those with underlying health conditions – to come forward when called for their jab.

We also encourage everyone to keep up the actions that are helping to reduce the spread of the virus – meeting in well-ventilated spaces, washing hands regularly and staying away from others where possible if you have symptoms of a respiratory illness.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in most indicators in week 33 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) decreased in England in week 33 to 124 compared to 172 in the previous week.

Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 33 was 4.7 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 5.9 in the previous week.

The hospital admission rate for week 33 was 7.35 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 8.90 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 remain highest in the North East, with a rate of 9.67 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Clinical Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

COVID-19 case rates and hospitalisations are at low levels and continue on a downward trend.

The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines significantly reduces the risk of being seriously ill with the virus. When the autumn booster is rolled out in a few weeks’ time we urge all those eligible – people aged 50 and over and those with underlying health conditions – to come forward for their jab.

We also encourage everyone to keep up the actions that are helping to reduce the spread of the virus – meeting in well-ventilated spaces, washing hands regularly and staying away from others where possible if you have symptoms of a respiratory illness.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in most indicators in week 32 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) decreased in England in week 32 to 172 compared to 239 in the previous week.

Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 32 was 5.7 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 6.8 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the North East, with a rate of 13.42 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Clinical Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

It’s very encouraging that COVID-19 case rates and hospitalisation are now at low levels. We expect them to remain low over the coming weeks before rising again as we head into the autumn and winter.

COVID-19 vaccines continue to provide the best defence against serious illness and hospitalisation with COVID-19. Plans are well under way for the roll-out of the autumn booster programme and we urge all those eligible – people aged 50 and over and those with underlying health conditions – to come forward when called to have the maximum protection against COVID-19.

We also encourage everyone to keep up the actions that are helping to reduce the spread of the virus – meeting in well-ventilated spaces, washing hands regularly and staying away from others where possible if you have symptoms of a respiratory illness.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in most indicators in week 31 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) decreased in England to 239 in week 31, compared to 271 in the previous week.

The hospital admission rate for week 31 was 10.10 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 12.09 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 remain highest in the West Midlands, with a rate of 15.13 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Clinical Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

COVID-19 case rates, hospitalisations andICUadmissions have continued to decline this week, in order to drive down the virus further we urge eligible people to keep coming forward for their vaccine.

Vaccination remains the best form of defence against hospitalisation and serious illness.

Meeting up outdoors or in well ventilated spaces where possible, observing good hand hygiene and covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing will continue to help reduce the spread of COVID-19.

Don’t forget that if you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection, and a high temperature or feel unwell, try to stay at home or away from others – especially elderly or vulnerable people.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in several indicators in week 30 of 2022.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) decreased in England to 271 in week 30, compared to 416 in the previous week.

The hospital admission rate for week 30 was 12.13 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 15.61 in the previous week.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 highest in the West Midlands, with a rate of 17.49 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Clinical Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

While COVID-19 case rates, hospitalisations andICUadmissions continue to show positive signs of decline we urge eligible people to keep coming forward for their vaccine.

Vaccination remains the best form of defence against hospitalisation and serious illness with the virus.

It’s also important to keep remembering the simple steps that will help to reduce the spread of COVID-19 – meet up outdoors or in well ventilated spaces where possible, observe good hand hygiene and cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.

Don’t forget that if you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection, and a high temperature or feel unwell, try to stay at home or away from others – especially elderly or vulnerable people.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 remain highest in the North East, with a rate of 20.19 per 100,000 population.

Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, Deputy Director of Public Health Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

We are now seeing decreases in COVID-19 case rates and hospitalisations. While this is encouraging, COVID-19 has not gone away and we really want to see further declines in the coming weeks and months. People aged 75 and over remain at particular risk of severe disease if they are not up to date with their vaccinations.

We urge anyone who is not up to date with their jabs to come forward to give themselves the best possible protection.

To help prevent the spread of COVID-19, try to meet up outdoors or in well ventilated spaces and remember to keep up good hand hygiene and cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing. It is also sensible to wear a face covering if you are in crowded, enclosed spaces.

If you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection, and a high temperature or feel unwell, try to stay at home or away from others – especially elderly or vulnerable people.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has increased slightly in several indicators in week 28 of 2022.

Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, Deputy Director of Public Health Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

The increase in COVID-19 case rates and hospitalisations continues to show signs of slowing but there is no room to be complacent and people aged 75 and over remain at particular risk of severe disease if they are not up to date with their vaccinations.

We urge all those who are eligible for a booster to take up the offer as soon as possible. Anyone who has not yet had their first or second dose, should also get up to date with their jabs to give themselves the best possible protection.

To help prevent the spread of COVID-19, try to meet up outdoors or in well ventilated spaces and remember to keep up good hand hygiene and cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing. It is also sensible to wear a face covering if you are in crowded, enclosed spaces.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 remain highest in the West Midlands, with a rate of 24.45 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Clinical Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

COVID-19 case rates and hospitalisations continue to rise, although the rate of increase appears to be slowing. Those aged 75 and over who have not taken up the offer of the spring booster put themselves at risk of severe disease.

We urge all those who are eligible for the spring booster to take up the offer as soon as possible. Anyone who has not yet had their first or second dose, should also get up to date with their jabs to give themselves the best possible protection.

To help prevent the spread of COVID-19, try to meet up outdoors or in well ventilated spaces and remember to keep up good hand hygiene and cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 remain highest in the West Midlands, with a rate of 16.97 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Clinical Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

We continue to see COVID-19 case rates and hospitalisations rise in all age groups, with the largest increases in hospitalisations andICUadmissions in those aged 75 and older.

There is likely to be a substantial amount of waning immunity in older people who have not taken up the booster on schedule, so we can expect these rises to continue over the coming weeks and throughout July.

It’s reassuring that 79.8 per cent of people aged 75 and over in June have had a vaccine in the past 6 months but we urge the remaining 16 per cent to get their spring booster as soon as possible to help protect against serious illness – preliminary analysis shows that the vaccine is continuing to protect against severe illness and remains the best defence against severe disease and hospitalisation. This includes anyone who had their last vaccine more than 6 months ago, as well as those living in care homes or who are clinically vulnerable.

Vaccination remains the best defence against severe disease and we urge anyone who’s eligible for the spring booster to take it up. Remember that COVID-19 has not gone away and we should all keep up good hand and respiratory hygiene.

It is also sensible to wear a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces. If you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection, and a high temperature or feel unwell, try to stay at home or away from others – especially elderly or vulnerable people.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 remain highest in the North West, with a rate of 15.09 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Clinical Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

We continue to see an increase in COVID-19 data, with a rise in case rates and hospitalisations in those aged 65 years and over, and outbreaks in care homes.

We can also now see a rise inICUadmissions in older age groups.

It’s reassuring that 83.5 per cent of people aged 75 and over have had a vaccine in the past 6 months but we urge the remaining 16.5% per cent, as well as those living in care homes or who are clinically vulnerable, to get their spring booster for protection against serious illness. Vaccination remains the best defence against severe disease and hospitalisation.

COVID-19 has not gone away and we should all remember to keep up good hand and respiratory hygiene. It is also sensible to wear a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 remain highest in the North East, with a rate of 12.45 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Clinical Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

We continue to see increases in COVID-19 outbreaks within care homes and hospitalisations among those aged 75 years and over.

Our data also shows that 17.5 per cent of people aged 75 years and over have not had a vaccine within the past 6 months, putting them more at risk of severe disease.

“We urge everyone in this age group, as well as those living in a care home or who are clinically vulnerable, to ensure they get their spring booster for protection against serious illness.

COVID-19 has not gone away and we should all remember to keep up good hand and respiratory hygiene. It is also sensible to wear a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 remain highest in the North East, with a rate of 10.70 per 100,000 population.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Clinical Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

After a period of low case rates, we are now seeing increases in outbreaks within care homes and in hospitalisations among those aged 80 years and over.

It is encouraging that we are not seeing an increase in intensive care unit (ICU) admissions but we are monitoring data closely and assessing the possible impact of subvariants BA.4 and BA.5.

As we enter summer, it’s still important to remember that COVID-19 has not gone away and to get vaccinated to reduce the risk of becoming seriously ill with the virus. If you’re not yet up to date with your jabs please come forward now – it’s not too late to get protected.

Remember to observe good hand and respiratory hygiene. It is also sensible to wear a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces. If you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection, and a high temperature or feel unwell, try to stay at home or away from others – especially elderly or vulnerable people.

From this week our surveillance has shifted focus on targeted testing for high risk groups such as NHS hospital patients, those eligible for antiviral and other COVID-19 treatments and health and social care staff. It is encouraging that hospital admissions appear to have plateaued this week and we will continue to monitor this closely over the coming weeks.

If you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection, such as a high temperature, try to stay at home or away from other people – especially those who are elderly or vulnerable.

Vaccination remains essential for all eligible people, so if you’re not up to date, please make sure you get your latest jab.

The main points from this week’snational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance reportare:

Surveillance indicators suggest that at a national level coronavirus (COVID-19) there were increases in some COVID-19 indicators but others decreased, suggesting that the rate of increase in activity seen in recent weeks may be slowing in week 13 of 2022.

Case rates remain highest in those aged 30 to 39, with a weekly rate of 820.0 per 100,000 population.

The lowest case rates remain in those aged 0 to 4, with a weekly rate of 196.4 per 100,000 population.

Weekly case rates per 100,000 population remain highest in the South West, at 804.5.

Case rates per 100,000 remain lowest in the London, with a weekly rate of 483.2.

The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) in England was 952 in week 13, compared to 851 in the previous week.

The hospital admission rate for week 13 was 20.46 per 100,000 population, in the previous week it was 20.08 per 100,000 population.

Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 were highest in the North East, with a rate of 31.14 per 100,000 population.

The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and over.

Professor Steven Riley, Director General of Data, Analytics and Surveillance at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

High case rates and increasing numbers of hospitalisations remind us that the pandemic is not over and COVID-19 still poses a real risk to vulnerable people. As people mix more, we have also seen increasing levels of common infections such as flu and norovirus.

If you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection such as a high temperature try to stay at home or away from other people – especially those who you know are vulnerable.

While people will be looking forward to catching up with friends and family over the Easter period, it’s important to keep indoor spaces well ventilated, wash your hands regularly and wear a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces or when visiting people at highest risk of severe illness with COVID19.

It’s important to catch up on any primary or booster jabs, so if you’re not up to date, please make sure you get a jab.

Dame Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

The pandemic is not over and how the virus will develop over time remains uncertain. COVID-19 still poses a real risk to many of us, particularly with case rates and hospitalisations on the rise. That is why it is sensible to wear a mask in enclosed spaces, keep indoor spaces ventilated and stay away from others if you have any symptoms of a respiratory illness, including COVID-19.

Vaccination remains the best way to protect us all from severe disease and hospitalisation due to COVID-19 infection. If you have not yet come forward for your primary or booster I would urge you to do so straight away. The NHS vaccine programme is there to help you and the sooner you are vaccinated the sooner you and your family and friends will be protected.

This week we publish the 100thnational influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report.

The rate at which we’re currently seeing cases increasing is a reminder to us all that the pandemic is not over. Hospital admissions and cases of COVID-19 have continued to rise and we can expect to see further increases before we start to see a decline.

Vaccination is the key to staying safe from serious illness and it’s vital that everyone gets all of their recommended doses. Wearing a face covering in crowded or enclosed spaces, socialising outside where possible, and always observing good hand hygiene will also help to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Anyone with symptoms or a positive tests should limit their contact with others as much as possible.

Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

COVID-19 is still circulating at high levels due to the high transmissibility of circulating variants and expected increases in social mixing.

While rates of severe disease and death due to COVID-19 remain low, hospital admissions have risen and we will therefore continue to monitor this data closely.

Vaccination remains our first and best line of defence against illness, and it’s vital that everyone has had their latest dose. We can all help reduce transmission by wearing a face covering in crowded or enclosed spaces, washing hands regularly and keeping rooms well ventilated.

Professor Steven Riley, Director General of Data, Analytics and Surveillance at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

Rates of COVID-19 continue to increase in younger age groups. While the booster program is protecting many of our friends and relatives, there are still people out there who had not yet taken up their offer of a booster. So as the holiday season approaches and average levels of social mixing go up, please do come forward if you are eligible for a vaccine or a booster, and take up the jab as soon as you are offered.

Older people and those with weaker immune systems are more vulnerable to infection. Always take a rapid lateral flow test before visiting anyone at higher risk of getting seriously ill from the virus.

Small changes can make a big difference in the risk of passing on the infection. Help protect yourself and loved ones by opening windows and doors to increase the air flow when meeting people inside. Please wear a mask in crowded places, wash your hands and, if you have any COVID-19 symptoms, stay at home and get aPCRtest as soon as possible.

Professor Steven Riley, Director General of Data, Analytics and Surveillance at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

Rates of COVID-19 continue to increase in those from younger age groups, and hospitalisations remain highest in those aged 85 and over. Following the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) announcement on Monday, more people than ever are eligible for second and booster doses – and it is as important as ever to get vaccinated or receive a booster jab as soon as you are offered one.

Socialising indoors in places with poor ventilation increases the risk of infection. Help protect yourself and loved ones by opening windows and doors to ventilate the room when meeting people inside. Wash your hands regularly and wear a mask in crowded places. If you have any COVID-19 symptoms, stay at home and get aPCRtest as soon as possible.

In October, the government consulted on measures to give theCMSmore powers to recover money faster to crack down on parents who repeatedly fail to take financial responsibility for their children.

Tomorrow (Monday 12 February) the government is set to publish the response to this consultation, confirming these reforms will be accelerated to make the system fairer for children and parents.

The government is also removing the £20 application fee for child maintenance service and making all applications free from 26 February 2024, to ensure no child misses out on vital support.

Child maintenance makes a real difference to the life chances of many thousands of children, which is why we’re reforming the Child Maintenance Service for the long term to ensure we deliver a brighter future for them and their families.

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Mel Stride MP said:

We know the vast majority of parents strive each and every day to give their children the best possible start in life.

But those who shirk the financial responsibilities they have for their children must be quickly held to account. That’s why we are fast-tracking enforcement from six months to six weeks – making the system fairer for parents and above all for children.

The consultation also sought views on proposed regulations which mean theCMScan use an administrative liability order to recover unpaid child maintenance instead of having to apply to the courts.

This change will help reduce the time it takes to obtain a liability order, from around 22 weeks to as little as six to eight weeks – and ensure that further action such as forced sale of property or disqualification from driving can be considered much sooner.

Around 10,000 parents a year who wilfully refuse to pay maintenance will be affected by the law change, creating more financial security for thousands of children and parents.

DWPMinister Viscount Younger said:

The Child Maintenance Service makes a real difference to the lives of over 900,000 children across the UK, withCMSand family-based arrangements helping to keep around 160,000 out of poverty each year.

That’s why, alongside improving enforcement action, we’re removing the application fee so the Child Maintenance Service is accessible to everyone, meaning the poorest families can ensure their children are properly provided for.

They also include new powers for theCMSto write off debt worth less than £7 in a small number of inactive cases that would have been closed were it not for small outstanding balances.

This will ensure taxpayers’ money, as well as caseworker time and effort, is directed effectively. These powers, coupled with improvements to the liability order process, will allow theCMSto target swift action against parents who owe significantly larger sums and where the impact on households missing out on money is greater.

The expansion of the Affordable Homes Scheme, which provides low-cost loans to housing providers, will support thousands of new homes. For the first time, the scheme can also be used to upgrade existing properties, making them warm and decent for tenants.

Providers will be able to apply for loans to carry out vital building safety works, such as the removal of dangerous cladding.

Backed by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, the now £6 billion fund will help housing providers access low-cost loans so they can expand their business, build more affordable homes and upgrade their existing stock.

“We know getting cost-effective loans can be a stumbling block for many developers building more affordable homes or upgrading their existing stock, so it is of the quality tenants deserve.

“This new round opening today will not only improve the lives of those already living in homes, but help thousands of families benefit from new, high-quality, affordable housing.”

Launched in 2020, the scheme, delivered by ARA Venn, is already helping 12 providers to deliver 6,290 new homes, with thousands more to be built in the coming years.

Among the beneficiaries of the scheme is Watford Community Housing. They first accessed the scheme back in November 2021 and it helped them build 200 new homes, including the firm’s first modular development.

As part of a second funding application made in December, they are set to build a further 100 affordable homes.

“We were delighted to work with ARA Venn for a second time under the current Affordable Homes Guarantee Scheme. The funding represents excellent value for the sector and offers best value for fixed rate debt for our organisation.

“The benefit of using the Affordable Homes Guarantee Scheme in terms of pricing over our 30-year plan is worth nearly 100 additional homes being delivered into our local community. This has significant commercial benefit to us but more importantly has a direct impact on the wider need to build more housing across the country.”

“We are delighted that we will be able to provide low-cost loans to private registered providers across England to now facilitate investment in existing homes, in addition to new ones.

“We look forward to continuing and building on the success of the Affordable Homes Guarantee Scheme, that has already proved a key source of funding for the sector.

“This timely expansion of the scheme allows us to support the sector’s balancing of investment priorities between providing new homes and ensuring the quality and energy efficiency of existing homes.”

The Government is making good progress and is on track to meet its manifesto commitment to build 1 million homes this Parliament and the target to deliver 300,000 homes a year remains. This work is being supported by £10 billion investment to boost housing supply since the start of this Parliament. This is alongside the £11.5 billion affordable homes programme, which will unlock £38 billion in additional private investment.

I’ve walked through an Israeli Kibbutz where parents were slaughtered in front of their children. I’ve listened to stories of families whose loved ones have cruelly been taken hostage by Hamas, and heard testimony from British citizens fleeing the bombardment of Gaza.

There have been warnings that Iran could escalate the conflict in the Middle East through their proxies like Hizbollah in Lebanon or the Houthis in Yemen.

And I’ve seen briefings that make clear the risks of cyber attacks and industrial espionage, whether they are coming out of China, Russia or North Korea.

Always, the conclusion I reach is the same.

It is hard to recall in recent memory a time of such danger and uncertainty.

When I started my first political job in the late 1980s working for Margaret Thatcher, things looked so different.  The Cold War was ending and the Berlin Wall coming down.  Democracy was spreading, trade barriers were tumbling and more countries and people were embracing freedom and prosperity.

How should we respond to this new reality?

First, by understanding how profoundly our world has changed.

The forces shaping it – a warmonger in the Kremlin, a more aggressive China, Islamist extremism poisoning young minds – these things aren’t going to disappear overnight.

There’s no point hoping for some magical return to the world as it once was. Hope isn’t a policy.

And there’s no point pretending that we can somehow insulate ourselves from these crises, or pull up some imaginary drawbridge.

It’s not just that Putin’s war has hit energy and food prices here at home.  Or that conflict in the Middle East, if it flares out of control, can do the same.

It’s that if Putin isn’t stopped in Ukraine he will be back for more. And we know from our history that appeasing dictators ultimately wrecks British interests and costs British lives.

Conflict in the Middle East doesn’t stay in the region.  It can destabilise our allies and trigger mass migrations.  And it deeply affects Jewish and Muslim populations in our own countries.

Our response needs to be one of strength, resilience and unity.

We need to build up our defences, stay close to our strongest friends and partners, and reach out to new allies.

That’s why next week I will be heading to Washington DC to work with our closest and strongest ally, the USA.

The debate there – about how much to help Ukraine and for how long – is underway.

I know the arguments – that European security is American security and that dictators shouldn’t be appeased – will win the day.

But I want to reassure them that we will stay the course and galvanise other allies too.

Yes, I stood in the bombed cathedral in Ukraine, but I also heard how Ukraine’s forces destroyed a fifth of Russia’s attack helicopters in Ukraine in just one night.  How Putin’s Black Sea fleet has been pushed largely out of Crimea.  How Ukraine is shipping grain again, with its economy growing again.

Likewise, while the scenes unfolding in Gaza are appalling, we doubled our humanitarian aid to those needing support in Gaza, and have been able to use the recent humanitarian pauses to get hostages out and aid in.

In these uncertain times, we need to make sure that the assets we have really deliver the results we need.

In recent years, the Government has crafted a new security strategy which wins praise from allies. We have increased defence spending. We have shown leadership on Ukraine and in NATO. We have forged stronger ties in the Gulf and Indo-Pacific. We must keep driving this work forward.

It is a privilege to return to Government with responsibility for the Foreign Office.

I want to use my experience to make sure that every part of it – from world class diplomats to experts in development, from our crises response teams to our world renowned intelligence capabilities – are focused on our security and our prosperity.

With strength and resilience must come unity.

Last week I sat in NATO’s first Council meeting with Ukraine and saw the strength of the most successful alliance in history.  Add together the economies of the countries backing Ukraine against Russia and we outmatch Putin by almost 30 to 1.  With the support we give to Ukraine – whether its artillery shells or economic support - we must make that economic strength count.

And if we can bring together all those who want a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians, we may even be able to turn this horrific situation into an opportunity for real progress.

We must be clear-eyed about both the threats we face and those who want to see us fail.

But if we turn this moment of danger and insecurity into something that brings a new sense of unity between allies, there is no reason why we cannot prevail."

ITV’s two-part fly-on-the-wall series, ‘Her Majesty’s Prison - Aylesbury’, shows how staff at the Buckinghamshire prison - which holds over 400 young men aged between the ages of 18 and 21 - go about their daily work. It also gives an insight in to all aspects of prison life, including managing violence and maintaining order, as well as the efforts to rehabilitate offenders to reduce their chances of reoffending on release.

The prison’s Governor Kevin Leggett said:

‘We were clear from the start that we wanted the documentary to show staff characteristics, what motivates them to do the job they do each do each day and how they go about dealing with some very challenging individuals.

‘Our job is to find out what the best approach is to managing offenders and our ultimate goal is to rehabilitate them. We owe them, the victims of their crime and society in general, that.’

The series was produced by Wild Pictures, the company behind the previous prison documentaries Holloway, Wormwood Scrubs, and most recently Strangeways.

Broadcast in May 2011, ‘Strangeways’ attracted more than five million viewers and won a BAFTA award.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/spending-review-to-fight-virus-deliver-promises-and-invest-in-uks-recovery,News story,"Spending Review to fight virus, deliver promises and invest in UK’s recovery","The UK Government will provide billions of pounds in the fight against coronavirus, deliver on the promises it has made to the British people and invest in the UK’s recovery, the Chancellor announced today.",HM Treasury,25 November 2020,"Delivering the Spending Review, Rishi Sunak said his immediate priority was to protect people’s lives and livelihoods as the country continues to battle the outbreak - allocating £55 billion to tackle the virus next year.

He also set out how the government would deliver stronger public services – honouring the promises it made to the British people with core day-to-day departmental spending growing by £14.8 billion in cash terms next year compared to 2020/21. From 2019/20 levels, that is an average growth of 3.8% a year, the fastest rate in 15 years.

The Chancellor also announced how the government would deliver the next stages of its record investment plans in infrastructure to drive the UK’s recovery and level up for a greener, stronger future with £100 billion of capital spending next year and a £4 billion Levelling Up Fund.

Setting out the budgets for government departments and devolved administrations’ block grants for 2021/21, the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said:

Today’s Spending Review delivers on the priorities of the British people. Our health emergency is not yet over, and the economic emergency has only just begun; so our immediate priority is to protect people’s lives and livelihoods.

But today’s Spending Review also delivers stronger public services - paying for new hospitals, better schools and safer streets. And it delivers a once-in-a-generation investment in infrastructure. Creating jobs, growing the economy, and increasing pride in the places people call home.

The Spending Review builds on the unprecedented action already provided to tackle the pandemic so far. It confirms an additional £38 billion for public services to continue to fight the pandemic this year, and a further £55 billion to departments to respond to Covid-19 next year, including £2.6 billion for the devolved administrations.

Investment targeted at controlling and suppressing the virus - and saving lives - includes funding to enhance testing capacity, purchase vaccines, increase supply of key Covid-19 medicines, and purchase and distribute PPE.

Targeted funding is also being provided to support vital public services to help them meet and recover from the challenges of Covid. This includes money to help the NHS recover and address delayed treatments, extra funding for local authorities, support for transport, and funding to help the justice system address backlogs.

Delivering real-world improvements to the day-to-day services provided by public services is at the heart of the government’s vision to rebuild for a stronger future. The Spending Review delivers on the government’s promises to support a high quality, resilient healthcare system, level up education standards, continue tackling crime to keep people safe, and support local authorities in their efforts to serve local communities. This includes:

Throughout the pandemic the government have provided an unprecedented economic support package to protect and create jobs. The Spending Review builds on this by investing an additional £3.6 billion to build on commitments made in the Plan for Jobs.

This includes the new 3-year £2.9 billion Restart scheme to help more than one million unemployed people find work.

The Spending review announces the next phase of the government’s infrastructure revolution with £100 billion of capital expenditure next year, to kickstart growth and support hundreds of thousands of jobs. It gives multi-year funding certainty for select projects – such as school and hospital rebuilding, housing and transport schemes – and targets additional investment in areas which will improve the UK’s competitiveness in the long-term, backing new investments in cutting-edge research and clean energy sources, investing in a greener future by delivering against the Prime Minister’s ten-point plan for climate change.

The Chancellor also set out plans to further the levelling up agenda by launching a new £4 billion Levelling Up Fund that will invest in local infrastructure that has a visible impact on people and their communities and will support economic recovery. A refreshed Green Book will also better link projects and programmes to Government objectives, including on levelling up and Net Zero.

This is supported by the new National Infrastructure Strategy outlining the government’s long-term vision for infrastructure investment, and a new UK infrastructure bank - headquartered in the north of England - to work with the private sector to finance major new investment projects across the UK. And to ensure that Government policies that have the most impact on levelling-up are created by those living in communities outside of London and the South East, the Treasury will set up its Northern headquarters next year. This is part of a wider work that will see thousands of civil servants move to the regions and nations of the UK.

To help people with their finances, the Chancellor also announced an increase in the National Living Wage, by 2.2% to £8.91 an hour from April 2021, likely benefiting around two million of the lowest paid.  Alongside that, 2.1 million public sector workers who earn below the median wage of £24,000 will be guaranteed a pay rise of at least £250. And to help businesses, the business rates multiplier will be frozen in 2021-22, saving businesses in England £575 million over the next five years.

The Spending Review also strengthens the UK’s place in the world as open and outward-looking, leading in solving the world’s toughest problems. The UK will spend the equivalent of 0.5% of national income as overseas aid in 2021. The Spending Review therefore provides £10 billion of Official Development Assistance (ODA) in 2021-22. This will ensure the UK remains one of the largest overseas aid donors in the world.
And to provide security not just for the UK but also around the world, the Chancellor also confirmed the announcement made by the Prime Minister which will see over £24 billion of investment in defence, the biggest sustained increase in 30 years."

Think Fraud, the National Campaign Against Fraud, launches today.","Home Office, The Rt Hon James Cleverly MP, and The Rt Hon Tom Tugendhat MBE VR MP",12 February 2024,"A major campaign to transform the fight against fraudsters launches today (12 February 2024).

Stop! Think Fraud is backed by leading counter fraud experts who are uniting under one voice to provide consistent, clear and robust anti-fraud advice to the public.

Fraud accounts for around 40% of all crime in England and Wales, with an estimated 3.2 million offences each year. The latest data from the Crime Survey of England and Wales shows it has reduced by 13% over the past year. The estimated cost of fraud to society is £6.8 billion in England and Wales.

Fraud has also more than doubled in Scotland over the past 9 years and reports spiked in Northern Ireland during the pandemic, with a decline now being observed.

The evidence led campaign draws on the expertise of leading counter-fraud experts and includes an online fraud hub which will provide concise, simple to follow advice. It will also signpost victims to relevant organisations for further advice and support.

Impactful adverts will also be prominently displayed in public settings, from billboards to radio, and from TV screens to social media. It is anticipated the campaign will be seen by 95% of adults in the UK over the coming weeks.

Stop! Think Fraud 40 second TV advert

Home Secretary James Cleverly said:

Our bold Fraud Strategy is continuing to deliver for the British people.

This new campaign is a powerful tool to add to our arsenal, which already includes a world-first agreement from tech firms to prevent online fraud and the rollout of a National Fraud Squad that has 400 expert investigators.

I encourage everyone to stop, take a moment to think about fraud, and share this messaging far and wide.

Security Minister Tom Tugendhat said:

Fraud ruins lives. Following this advice will give people the best tips to stop fraudsters from stealing their hard-earned cash, and point them towards all the help and information on offer.

Our Fraud Strategy is successfully turning the tide against fraudsters. This new campaign will share the details we all need to defend ourselves and our friends.

Stop! Think Fraud is a ground-breaking step forward against the most prolific crime type in the UK and delivers on the Fraud Strategy’s commitment to release a public awareness campaign.

It has been created to empower a mass audience, with a new website providing vital guidance on how to spot fraud, stay safe and what to do if targeted. The web address will bewww.gov.uk/stopthinkfraud.

The campaign has far reaching support among the tech, financial and retail sectors, as well as law enforcement, victim care agencies and consumer groups. Supporting agencies have pledged to prominently display the Stop! Think Fraud advice and share it among their stakeholders.

They will also update pre-existing fraud advice they have shared in public places and replace it with the Stop! Think Fraud messaging and branding.

This one clear set of advice will remove confusion, which was a risk with so many different campaigns previously existing in the same space.

Temporary Commissioner Pete O’Doherty, from the City of London Police, said:

As the national lead force for fraud we wholeheartedly support Stop! Think Fraud and hope it will raise a much greater understanding of what fraud is and how to avoid it.

Fraud accounts for around 40% of all crime in the UK, so it’s vitally important to reach all corners of the country with this campaign to help protect everyone from the devastating financial and emotional impacts of fraud.

Alongside this campaign, we will continue to deliver on the National Fraud Strategy set by government and launch the replacement service for Action Fraud later this year.

Nick Sharp, Deputy Director for Fraud at the National Crime Agency, said:

Fraud is the most prevalent crime in the UK, impacting on millions of victims both financially and emotionally.

It is a priority for the National Crime Agency to reduce the harm that fraud causes – and the NCA has been working closely across a range of sectors to ensure that messages that help empower people to protect themselves are based on the collective knowledge of the law enforcement community.

The Stop! Think Fraud campaign is a major milestone that will build awareness of how to be better protected from becoming a victim, and how best to prevent and report fraud.

Felicity Oswald, Chief Operating Officer of the National Cyber Security Centre, said:

Prioritising basic security measures, such as enabling 2-step verification for your primary email account, is crucial to protect you against online fraud and increasingly sophisticated scams.

Following the advice from Stop! Think Fraud will help significantly reduce your risk of becoming a victim of fraudsters.

The launch of Stop! Think Fraud is a significant milestone in the Home Office’s delivery of theFraud Strategy, published in May 2023.

Key strategy pledges already fulfilled include the agreement of the world’s first charter to prevent online fraud, the rollout of the National Fraud Squad and the appointment of a government anti-fraud champion, a post occupied by Simon Fell MP.

Another strategy commitment will be delivered next month, when the Home Secretary welcomes interior ministers from international partners to London for the first ever Global Fraud Summit.

Representatives from Interpol, the EU Commission and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime will also be present, alongside some of the biggest companies and consumer groups in the world.

Wayne Stevens, National Fraud Lead at the charity Victim Support, said:

Fraud is a devastating crime. It’s essential that the public have access to reliable and up-to-date information about how to protect themselves – we’d urge everyone to take a look at this new guidance.

Sadly, there is still a lot of shame and stigma around fraud. For those who are targeted this stigma makes the experience even worse and often stops them seeking help.

We want everyone to understand that, if you are the victim of a fraud, it’s never your fault. We are available 24/7 to provide you with independent, free support.

Marc Allera, CEO, BT Group’s Consumer Division said:

As an industry, network operators have a responsibility to our customers to do all we can to help them spot and stop scams. So we’re fully behind the UK Government’s new National Campaign Against Fraud.

We’re constantly investing and deploying new technologies to prevent fraud taking place across the UK’s telecommunications infrastructure – and we know that partnerships across government, industry and law enforcement are critical to fully tackle the issue.

This campaign is a great example of that collaboration in action, and provides clear and simple guidance everyone can follow to help protect themselves from fraud.

Matt Hepburn, Fraud Spokesperson at TSB, said:

Fraudsters continue to bombard the public with fake texts, calls and scam content online – so it’s vital that we all remain alert to the threat.

The Home Office campaign is a powerful way of reminding millions of consumers to be wary of scams that reach us online, via social media, or through our phones.

The Home Office is working with the following stakeholders on the campaign:"

Horizon Europe is the world’s largest collaborative programme of research collaboration, which the UK is a part of after the Prime Minister secured a bespoke deal, last year, which increased the benefits of association to UK scientists as well as value for money for the UK taxpayer.

Secretary of State Donelan and Commissioner Ivanova will set out how both the UK and EU are determined to make a success of the UK’s Horizon Europe association, at a joint event being held at the Royal Society for decisionmakers from across the academic and business sectors. The event is targeted towards groups who have not previously heavily engaged in Horizon, such asSMEs, as well as businesses and scientists across Europe who could stand to benefit from collaboration with UK researchers through the programme. UK firms already benefitting from Horizon funding include Nova Innovation, whose consortium won over £17 million to develop tidal energy in Orkney, and South Yorkshire tech firm The Floow who are part of a project awarded just under £3 million, looking into road safety.

Horizon Europe is worth around £80 billion in total, and with the average Horizon grant worth £450,000 to a UK business or researcher, it offers an enormous opportunity for anyone doingR&Dto secure backing for vitally important research benefitting all our lives, from health to the environment. Horizon Europe is also truly international, giving researchers the opportunity to work confidently alongside colleagues from across the EU, New Zealand, Canada and Israel. This enormous potential for opening up access to new markets and clients will be the focus of a new communications campaign, set to launch shortly across Italy and Spain, setting out how partnering with the UK’s brightest minds through Horizon can benefit some of Europe’s most innovative researchers.

“The UK’s bespoke deal on Horizon has opened up a whole world of opportunity for our researchers, from the £80 billion funding that’s available, to the vast benefits that come from working hand-in-hand with colleagues from Europe to Canada to New Zealand.

“From grants to support UK applicants to our Horizon comms blitz, we are determined to do all we can together with our European colleagues to seize this moment, and all it could do to help our brightest minds deliver jobs, growth, and breakthroughs that will make life better for us all.”

“My message to British researchers and innovative businesses is simple and clear: Apply! Thousands have succeeded before, joining forces with European partners, advancing science, boosting academic careers and business growth. I look forward to seeing many more UK beneficiaries in the Horizon Europe programme in the years to come.”

Aside from events at the Royal Society, today will also see further conversations take place on how the UK and EU can work together to make UK association to the programme a success including on how to enable UK and EU researchers to work closely together on new and emerging technologies, which have the potential to radically change how we live and work, for the better. The UK’s best-in-class science pedigree will be in full view when Commissioner Ivanova is joined byAIMinister Viscount Camrose on a tour of London’s Crick Institute, the world-leading biomedical lab, earlier in the day.

The UK is already established as a world leader in this area, having hosted the first-everAISafety Summit last year, and with landmark strategies to cement the country’s best-in-class position on quantum and engineering biology.

Today’s UK-EU event is the first in a series of moments that will take place throughout 2024, aimed at ensuring the message about Horizon reaches businesses of all kinds, who might not have previously considered applying, as well as researchers and academics in every part of the country. It comes hot on the heels of the launch of a new UK-facing multi-channel communications campaign, shining a light on the real-world benefits of Horizon to businesses and researchers with advertising across social media, podcasts, digital displays and more. The new European communications push will take this message even further, showing the value of Great British businesses, scientists and researchers as partners in some of the most promising fields, from life sciences to robotics.

All of this builds concrete support already being made available to encourage UK bids for Horizon funding, such as ‘pump priming’ grants of up to £10,000 already being offered in partnership with the British Academy to support the applications of selected UK researchers and businesses to help them create better applications. The aim is for this funding to encourage those researchers who have not previously had experience, including next generation researchers, to apply to Horizon – and the schemeremains open for a second round of bidsuntil 21 February.

Science, innovation and technology will be critical to the future of the UK. By leading the way in these fields, we can grow the economy, one of the Prime Minister’s five priorities, as well as unlock breakthroughs that could improve everyone’s quality of life.

We know from recent history that the UK can be a leader in this area. We have four of the top ten universities in the world, and the second-highest number of Nobel prize winners. A quarter of projects in which the UK participated, funded through Horizon’s predecessor, were UK-led.

Horizon Europe is built around three main pillars – excellent science (Pillar 1), global challenges and industrial competitiveness (Pillar 2), and innovative Europe (Pillar 3). Horizon’s Pillar 2 has the largest budget, and supports research that is aimed at tackling some of the biggest problems facing society, from improving people’s health to tackling climate change. The average Horizon grant from Pillar 2 is worth £450,000 to a UK business.

Further information, including practical support on how to apply is available onInnovate UK’s websitealso host regular events that help guide businesses and researchers through the opportunities on offer and the application process.

Encouraging smaller businesses to pitch for, and win, Horizon and Copernicus funding supportsDSIT’s aim to help the UK’s promising science and tech firms scale-up and grow."

Museums across England which are accredited by Arts Council England are encouraged to apply for a share of £23.8 million funding in the latest round of the Museum Estate and Development Fund (MEND), which has been launched today by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

The fund is part of the Government’s long-term plan to support local economic growth and will support capital projects at museums, fund important repairs, and improve the visitor experience with grants being available from £50,000 to £5 million to ensure local history has a home for years to come.

Since it was launched in 2021, 67 projects have received a total of more than £40 million, with funding having already benefited a wide variety of museums. Among the successful applicants were Scarborough’s Rotunda Museum, where it has funded stonework repairs, and the Framework Knitters Museum in Nottingham, where it supported urgent repairs to its roof, chimneys, windows and gutters.

Arts and Heritage Minister Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay said:

Museums across the country form the heart of their community, helping people to learn about our shared heritage, and attracting tourists to the local area.

Over the past two years I’ve been delighted to see how this fund has provided vital support to museums across the country, enabling them to improve their buildings and share their wonderful collections with a wider audience.

The additional funding we are announcing today will mean that even more museums can fund major infrastructure projects, demonstrating the Government’s strong commitment to supporting culture and making sure that everyone has access to brilliant arts and heritage, no matter where they live.

Previous projects which have benefited from the Museum Estate and Development (MEND) Fund include the following:

The successful applicants to the third round of funding launched last year worth £22.6 million are due to be announced in the spring.

Darren Henley, Chief Executive of Arts Council England, said:

Museums bring huge benefits to towns and cities across England and the people who live in them.  By investing in the infrastructure they need, we can make sure our museums are fit for the future, and can make an even greater contribution to their local economies and communities.

We’re excited to continue delivering the programme on behalf of the Department for Culture, Media & Sport, and look forward to seeing the impact of the projects it supports.

This funding builds on £15.2 million of support from the Government’s Cultural Development Fund which was announced last month. Both the Museum and Estate Development Fund and the Cultural Development Fund form part of the Cultural Investment Fund, along with the Libraries Investment Fund. Through the first two rounds of theCultural Investment Fund, 134 organisations across the country have received a share of £106.8 million.

Arts Council England delivers this fund on behalf of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). Guidance has been published today by Arts Council England to provide further information for accredited museums considering making an application.

Biodiversity Net Gain, introduced through the world-leading Environment Act, will help deliver the government’s commitment to halt species decline by 2030. It means developers in England are now legally required to deliver at least a 10% increase in biodiversity when major building projects are undertaken. Many housing developers are already successfully operating Biodiversity Net Gain and recognising the benefits for people and nature. But from today, it will be mandatory.

To help Local Planning Authorities integrate Biodiversity Net Gain at a local level, £10.6 million of funding is being committed to help local authorities recruit and expand ecologist teams, investing in green jobs and increasing capacity to create new wildlife-rich habitats alongside developments.

“Biodiversity Net Gain will help us deliver the beautiful homes the country needs, support wildlife and create great places for people to live.

“This government is going further and faster for nature, since 2010 we have restored an area for nature larger than the size of Dorset, banned micro plastics and set ambitious targets to halt biodiversity decline.

“This vital tool builds on our work to reverse the decline in nature and for everyone to live within a 15-minute walk of a green space or water and will transform how development and nature can work together to benefit communities.”

“If we are to halt and reverse the decline of wildlife in line with our ambitious national targets then it will be vital to ensure that new habitats are created to compensate those being lost to developments.

“Biodiversity Net Gain is a key moment on our path to halting the decline of nature, enabling developers to make a positive contribution through creating new habitats, increasing access to green spaces, and building healthy and resilient places for people to live and work.

“Many developers are already using Biodiversity Net Gain in new developments and recognising the benefits for people and nature.”

“We need to take this opportunity and make sure Biodiversity Net Gain can help towards nature’s recovery. Central government, local authorities, developers, and nature charities like The Wildlife Trusts must work together to bring nature to our doorsteps and wildlife to our windows.”

Developers like Berkeley Group have been carrying out developments using Biodiversity Net Gain for several years.

“Biodiversity Net Gain is a positive step for the homebuilding industry and will bring nature back to our towns and cities. Putting this into practice on over 50 sites has been a hugely positive experience for Berkeley Group and these greener, wilder landscapes have huge benefits for the communities around them.

“The challenge now is to make sure that developers and planning authorities take a positive and collaborative approach to delivering Biodiversity Net Gain across the country. This is a big change for everyone involved and we need to work together to unlock the full benefits for people, planet, and prosperity.”

Biodiversity Net Gain requires development to avoid harm to nature, but where that is unavoidable, developers must create new habitats or enhance existing ones either within the site itself or by investing in nature sites elsewhere. Biodiversity Net Gain means there will be more nature after a development than before. Where this is not possible, developers can purchase off-site biodiversity units from landowners via a private market.

Local authorities have a range of tools to help them enforce Biodiversity Net Gain, while the Environment Act 2021 includes mechanisms to ensure that commitments through conservation covenants are adhered to. Off-site projects will be tracked and monitored through a digital register maintained by Natural England.

Biodiversity Net Gain for small sites will still be applicable from April 2024, and implementation for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects remains planned for 2025. Biodiversity Net Gain will prioritise on-site nature development to deliver the maximum benefits for people and nature.

England is the only country in the world with mandatory Biodiversity Net Gain, further cementing our position as world leader on the environment. The UK was also the first country in the world to have legally binding targets to halt the decline of nature. Since the launch of theEnvironmental Improvement Planin January 2023, the government has delivered on over 50 commitments to protect and restore our natural environment including a ban on single-use plastics, planting nearly 5 million trees, introducing the Species Survival Fund, and improving public access to nature with 245 additional miles opened along the King Charles III England Coast Path.

The delivery of BNG within the red line boundary must be considered first before looking off-site."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-committal-hearings-abolished,News story,More committal hearings abolished,Criminals will face justice far more quickly as court committal hearings are abolished in dozens of areas of England and Wales from today.,Ministry of Justice and The Rt Hon Damian Green,5 November 2012,"Criminals will face justice far more quickly as court committal hearings are abolished in dozens of areas of England and Wales from today.

Scrapping the hearings will help the courts run more efficiently and ensure they provide a better service for users.

They were abolished in 12 areas in June 2012 and will be phased out across the rest of England and Wales over the next year. Nationally the changes will mean that around 60,000 fewer hearings will be needed each year.

Criminal Justice Minister Damian Green said:

“Abolishing committal hearings is another one of the steps we are taking to make justice swift and sure, and to ensure our courts run efficiently and effectively for victims, witnesses and the taxpayers whose money funds them. The justice system needs continued improvement, and this announcement is an important step forward.”

The changes are the latest in a series of moves saving time and money for the whole justice system. Other measures included introducingflexible courthours in evening and weekends in 48 areas and increasing the use of video links between courts, prisons and police stations.

Committal hearings are a procedural part of the court process, used to officially transfer a case from the Magistrates Courts, where lower level crimes are dealt with, to the Crown Court, which handles most serious offences. Where they have been abolished, cases will now be sent to the Crown Court as soon as it is clear the matter is serious enough, without the need for a separate hearing.

There are 10 IFCAs around the English coastline and they are responsible for sustainably managing sea fisheries within 6 nautical miles from shore. They have the power to make byelaws to protect resources and the environment in their area as well as also enforcing national and European fisheries legislation.

IFCAs are either committees or joint committees of the local authorities that fall within an IFC district. They are tasked with sustainably managing inshore sea fisheries resources in their local area. They are made up of representatives from local councils along with people from across the different sectors that use or are knowledgeable about the inshore marine area, such as commercial and recreational fishermen, environmental groups and marine researchers, who offer their time voluntarily.

The Marine Management Organisation, Environment Agency and Natural England also each has a statutory seat on the IFCA. Through their local management and funding structures, IFCAs help put local councils, communities and businesses, and individual citizens in the driving seat, allowing them to play a bigger part in the protection and enhancement of their inshore marine environment."

The guidance comes into force on 1 April 2024 (1).

The guidance includes the introduction of:

The guidance issued today takes account of industry and MOD views shared in workshops and meetings, and in their responses to our working papers issued in May 2023.

There will be corresponding changes in reporting requirements, which will also come into force from 1 April 2024. We plan to consult on these from mid-February and issue details of the reporting guidance changes from mid-March (2).

John Russell, SSRO Chief Executive, said:

“The MOD is bringing considerable changes to the existing regulatory framework, including new provisions that can be used in single source defence contracting. These changes bring greater flexibility and speed for the MOD and the defence industry in agreeing contracts.

We will support industry, the MOD and its delivery organisations through these changes. We are updating our guidance and providing practical support. You will see us on the ground working closely with you; remaining independent but using our skills to support you in using the guidance we have developed.

We have published our guidance now to give you time to become familiar with it ahead of it going live in April. We are keen to hear your feedback, which will help us to further improve the guidance.”

The consultation issued today is available here:

The consultation seeks views on the following new and updated pricing guidance:

The consultation is open until 17 April 2024 and we welcome your views. If you would like to discuss any aspect of the guidance please contact David Goodwin (david.goodwin@ssro.gov.ukor 020 3771 4790).

Later in 2024 we will update the guidance to incorporate feedback from this consultation and will benefit from the early practical experience of the MOD and defence industry contractors as they apply the new guidance and the legislation.

Notes to Editors:

(1) The guidance has been released following the changes introduced through Schedule 10 of the Procurement Act, which builds on the Secretary of State for Defence’s periodic review of the Defence Reform Act 2014. The guidance also draws on thedraft Single Source Contract (Amendment) Regulations 2024, which were laid for consideration in Parliament on 22 January 2024.

(2) Implementation timeline:

Due to the short time period between the legislation being presented to Parliament and when it comes into force in April 2024, the guidance will take effect during the later part of the consultation period. Given the scale of the changes to the regulatory framework, we want to ensure stakeholders have the longest possible familiarisation period with the guidance.

After the close of the consultation, the SSRO will consider the responses it receives and make updates to the guidance later in 2024. This is to minimise disruption and ensure that the SSRO is doing all it can to make it easy for those who use the framework to understand, comply with and realise the benefits from the changes.

https://govdiff.njk.onl/update/2024-02-12T09:08:00+00:00/www.gov.uk/government/news/where-marble-stone-and-wifi-meet,News story,"Where marble, stone and wifi meet",Most of us take being connected to wifi for granted – at home we simply plug in and go. But when it comes to an office building it’s not always so simple.,Government Property Agency,12 February 2024,"The Government Property Agency (the GPA) provides services to many different types of buildings, from a GPA-managed state-of-the-art hub such as 23 Stephenson Street in Birmingham and fully refurbished offices such as 3-8 Whitehall in London, to typical office spaces up and down the country. And then there are the listed buildings.

Many government offices, particularly in Whitehall, have listed building status and One Horse Guards Road in London  - part of Government Offices Great George Street (GOGGS) - is a perfect example. When architect John Brydon designed the building back in 1898, paving the way for the future installation of a major shared wifi network was not on his mind.

Throughout GOGGS, thick walls of Portland stone envelop the interior space which features six-storey high glazed brick walls, marble pillars, intricate cornicing, oak panelling and sash windows, not to mention many significant works of art. Famous for its large ‘drum’ shaped central courtyard – scene of movies such as Spectre, Darkest Hour and even Fast & Furious 6 – and the room where Churchill announced Victory in Europe, the building has Grade II* Listed status which means it’s judged to be of particular national and historical importance.

It’s also an important part of the Whitehall estate, at the heart of the Civil Service, and needs to be run and managed in line with the Government’s net zero targets.

All this presented a massive challenge for Mike Lorandeau, one of the GPA’s Senior Project Managers, who is responsible for making sure shared networks for wifi are delivered throughout GOGGS. Mike said:

As well as being an IT installation manager I’ve got expertise in listed buildings, having learned over the years how best to liaise with numerous stakeholders, facilities and building management teams, and planning and historic conservation experts.

It’s meant being creative with the approach to finding the best solutions, working out the best way to scope out a listed building, getting the right permissions to install our access points, and finding the right place to put wires into walls without spoiling the look of historically important rooms.

The complexity of this project was only revealed as they began the work, with the discovery that new power, lights and cooling were required for server rooms and signal points, as well as fire suppression systems.

The Grade II* Listed status of the entire GOGGS building puts it at the top of the list for protection and preservation, severely restricting what the team could do. Time to call on some specific expertise.

The work was carried out overnight by specialist contractors who know the building and the listing constraints well, having worked there over many years. And by morning, everything was back in place with no sign the contractors had ever been there.

Once tested and fully deployed, the new shared network meant civil servants could come in to work and carry on as usual, enjoying the ease of connection.

Before, access points for wifi were few and far between, with many placed on the floor which meant a poor connection for those using the spaces. Now these are placed high up on walls, in a design approved for a listed building, with the white boxes blending in discreetly. More importantly, there are around 1,000 access points throughout the building, delivering a strong signal for users.

Shared networks at One Horse Guards Road are now fully up and running, while the remainder of the work at GOGGS, which includes 100 Parliament Street, is planned to be delivered during the first quarter this year.

Paul O’Toole, the GPA’s Head of IT Service Management, said:

This project has been a real journey of discovery for all of us but particularly for Mike, who has stoically tackled each challenge as it has come up and found solutions.

When we took over the building in October 2021, our surveys had already told us that we needed to replace the existing wifi network. We have since installed a single, resilient high-performing network across the whole site.

This project wasn’t for the faint hearted – Mike has had to deal with Listed Building Consent, contractors and suppliers, as well as working around customers using the building every day. We have more work to do and we’re on track to switch on the 100 Parliament Street wifi.

Cabinet Office Director Paul Collman confirmed that customers were seeing the benefit:

We asked Cabinet Office Staff what they thought of the new wifi at One Horse Guards Road. The majority said it was more reliable, especially as they moved around the building."

Themarine plans– which provide much-needed guidance for sustainable development in English waters – cover the coast and seas from Flamborough Head to Felixstowe.

They have been developed by the Marine Management Organisation on behalf of the Secretary of State Owen Paterson, who has formally approved the plans.

Aninteractive toolexplaining how marine plans affect your area also goes live today (2 April) – the Marine Information System.

Marine plans will inform and guide decisions on development in marine and coastal areas, while conserving and enhancing the environment and recognising leisure uses too.

This should reduce costs and increase certainty for developers, boosting economic and employment benefits for coastal communities and beyond.

The first two plans cover the East inshore and offshore areas, with a total of 11 plans covering all English waters anticipated by 2021.Our seas have become increasingly busy, with industries such as oil and gas, wind farms, shipping, aggregates and fishing competing for space with each other and with nature. The marine economy is currently worth more than £49 billion a year and has the potential to grow significantly.

Environment Minister George Eustice said:

UK seas are home to one of the richest marine environments in the world and are currently worth more than £49 billion a year to our economy.

We are making sure that environmental considerations are embedded in every decision about proposed developments along the coast from Flamborough Head to Felixstowe and in our seas out to the maritime borders with the Netherlands, Belgium and France.

By 2021, marine plans will cover the entire English marine area, supporting an estimated £50 million of economic benefit each year and helping to promote sustainable development of the marine area.

MMO Chief Executive James Cross added:

These plans are the culmination of years of work by government, industry, environmental organisations and many others.

We are delighted to be at the forefront of sustainable marine development, cutting red tape for developers while taking full account of social and environmental impacts.

The UK has one of the richest marine environments in the world, with more than 8,000 species recorded in our seas.

Plans will take full account of marine protected areas, recognising the wealth of species and habitats in our seas

TheMarine Information Systemis an interactive tool to understand how the East marine plans apply to different marine sectors and geographic areas. It will highlight policies that apply to a chosen area to inform plan users, and mapping information makes searching for your area of interest easier.

Experience from developing the East marine plans is already informing the approach to the next two marine plans in the South – from Folkestone to the River Dart in Devon – including expanding the evidence base.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/clarke-tough-intelligent-sentences,Press release,Clarke: Tough intelligent sentences,Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke has today announced a new sentencing regime.,Ministry of Justice and The Rt Hon Kenneth Clarke KC,26 October 2011,"This will see more dangerous criminals given life sentences, an end to the indeterminate sentencing system, to be replaced by long determinate prison terms, and mandatory custodial sentences to be available for both adults and 16-17 years olds convicted of aggravated knife and offensive weapon offences.

It follows the Prime Minister’s announcement on 21 June 2011 that the Government would review the Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP) sentence with a view to replacing it with a new regime which would be better understood by the public and command greater confidence.

The new regime will include:

Kenneth Clarke said:

‘We intend to replace the widely criticised IPP system, which the public doesn’t have confidence in, with a new regime of tough, determinate sentences. Under our plans we expect more dangerous offenders to receive life sentences. Those getting the new Extended Determinate Sentence will have to serve at least two-thirds of it behind bars before release. We are clear that there will be no automatic release before the end of the full sentence for the most serious cases.

‘The new regime will restore clarity, coherence and common sense to sentencing, rid us of the inconsistent and confusing IPP regime and give victims a clearer understanding of how long offenders will actually serve in prison.

‘We have already announced that we are bringing in an automatic prison sentence for any adults who use a knife to threaten and endanger. Clearly any extension of this sentence to children requires very careful consideration. However, we need to send out a clear message about the seriousness of juvenile knife crime, so we are proposing to extend a suitable equivalent sentence to 16-17 year olds, but not to younger children.’

The new measures will be debated in the House of Commons next week and if passed, will be added to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill which is currently progressing through Parliament."

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/offenders-to-go-full-time-on-community-payback,Press release,Offenders to go full time on community payback,"Offenders will be made to do a full five day week of hard work and job-seeking, under new proposals for community sentences.",Ministry of Justice and Crispin Blunt,24 August 2011,"The work will include hard manual labour, improving public areas by clearing up litter, cleaning graffiti and maintaining parks and other green spaces.

The new instructions will see unemployed criminals forced to work a minimum of 28 hours over four days, with the fifth day spent looking for full time employment. Prior to today’s announcement, Community Payback programmes could be spread out over 12 months with some offenders working for a minimum of just six hours per week. The new, more intensive scheme, will also be delivered more immediately after sentence, imposed on offenders within seven days of sentencing, instead of the two weeks it currently takes following the court appearance.

About 100,000 individuals are sentenced to Community Payback each year across England and Wales with over 8.8 million hours of unpaid work completed last year. The public can nominate jobs for offenders viadirect.gov. Offenders can also be required to undertake hard manual labour such as working on a community farm, as in the attached case study.

These proposals for community sentencing are part of the Government’s plans to reform sentencing and tackle the root causes of offending. As well as giving something back to communities affected by crime, they will help bring structure to offenders’ lives. This will encourage them back into the routine of hard and meaningful work, in line with Government plans for Working Prisons for those who receive custodial sentences.

Minister for Prisons and Probation Crispin Blunt said:

‘If you are unemployed and on Community Payback you shouldn’t be sitting idle at home watching daytime television or hanging about with your mates on a street corner, you should be out paying back to your community through hard, honest work.

‘The public want to see offenders giving something back to their communities, but they are rightly not satisfied with seeing only a handful of hours a week dished out. Decent, law-abiding people can work a full five day week and so should offenders.

‘If we are to reduce the scandalous reoffending rates, it is essential that we help turn offenders into ex-offenders. The introduction of regular, meaningful hard work is proven to help break the cycle of crime and encourage a law-abiding life. This means fewer criminals, fewer victims of crime and much reduced costs for the taxpayer - a wholly positive result for society.’

Earlier this year the Ministry of Justice announced that Community Payback will be competed out to approved companies and probation trusts. The purpose of the competitions is to drive efficiencies in public protection and further help to cut re-offending.

This is one of a number of proposals to make community sentences more punitive. The Ministry of Justice recently confirmed that tagged offenders will be confined to their homes for up to 16 hours every day for a year.

Other measures being taken forward in the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill include a review of Imprisonment for Public Protection sentences, with a view to replacing them with a tougher determinate sentencing regime and a greater use of life sentences. The Government is also looking to introduce a new offence of aggravated knife possession, with a mandatory prison sentence of at least six months.

Please find details of a case study at Annex A.

The courts will continue to decide on the total number of hours of Community Payback an offender must complete; it is then for local Offender Managers to decide, based on an offender’s circumstances, the number of hours they complete each week.

Daniel, 32, Solihull

Daniel was sentenced to 120 hours of Community Payback after being convicted of assault in May 2010 and has gone from law-breaker to law-maker after being accepted to study at law school.

He carried out his sentence at Newlands Bishop Farm in Solihull. The project provides hard manual labour, including the construction of hen houses, putting-up buildings and fences, menagerie refurbishment, ground maintenance, forestry and hedge laying.

His probation officer John Whitehurst also helped him to enrol in an Access to Higher Education (HE) course which formed a small part of his unpaid work hours.

Daniel commented that his community sentence not only took away his liberty but allowed him to put something back into his local community.He said:

‘While it was hard at times, I didn’t realise how much probation could help me. I’m delighted to be accepted at one of the country’s best law schools and I’d like to thank everyone who helped me to get my life back on track.’"

The Simon Isaac (RX43) skippered by Brian Foad, was inspected by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) at Whitstable harbour on 1 May 2013 where it was found that his net did not have the required square mesh panel or headline panel and there was a deficiency with the extension piece.

The obstruction offence took place at Whitstable harbour on 4 July 2013 when Mr Foad prevented MMO marine officers from accessing the vessel to complete an inspection.

Mr Foad initially pleaded not guilty to all charges, but on the day of trial entered guilty pleas for the offences relating to the net but maintained his not guilty plea to the obstruction charge.
 He was found guilty of all charges and the court commented that the obstruction was “wilful” and Mr Foad’s evidence was “not credible.”

He was ordered to pay fines of £5,000 and legal and investigation costs of £6,565."

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said:

‘Some youth custodial places cost £200 000, five times the cost of sending a child to a top private school.  But nearly three quarters of young people leaving custody reoffend.

‘We cannot go on just doing more of the same, pouring more money into a system doesn’t work in the hope of a different outcome.  That doesn’t make any sense to the taxpayer, or to the young people who we should be trying to get back on the straight and narrow.

‘I want to see new models, perhaps something like secure colleges, providing education in a period of detention, rather than detention with education as an after-thought.’

Professionals from the education sector, custodial services and organisations with an interest in young people are among those being consulted on a complete transformation of youth custody.

The Green Paper looks at how to improve outcomes for young people in custody - drawing on experience from Free Schools and Academies and bringing new expertise and providers into the market.

The Marine Licensing (Application Fees) Regulations 2014has been published and it extends the MMO’s powers under the Marine and Coastal Access 2009 and introduces a revised fees structure for marine licence applications.

The new fees allow the MMO to recover 96% of costs and subsidise the remaining 4% to limit increases in fees for smaller projects. There is a new hourly rate of £94 for all projects, but there will be upper limits for fast tracked or routine projects.

The MMO is writing to tier 3 applicants – applications for bespoke projects where the time needed to deal with applications may vary – whose cases will be ongoing on 6 April to advise them of the changes to fees. These applicants will see an increase from £80 an hour to the new £94 rate.

The prosecution was brought after the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) identified a discrepancy in the information supplied in the vessel’s fishing logbook when compared with the data returned from the vessel’s satellite monitoring system. The court was told that the discrepancy would have resulted in an underestimation of the number of days the vessel had spent at sea, which are limited under the Western Waters Days at Sea Scheme.

The scheme applies to UK fishing vessels of 15 metres and over in length fishing for either king scallops (Pecten maximus) or queen scallops (Aequipecten opercularis) in ICES Area VII and limits the number of days such vessels may spend at sea for each 3-month period.

At an earlier hearing the defendants pleaded guilty to 4 offences of submitting inaccurate entries for the times of departure and return to port on the electronic logbook.

Skipper Stephen Trust was fined £1,500 for each of 3 offences and ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge plus £4,997 contribution to prosecution costs. Skipper Mark Bolton was fined £1,000 for 1 offence and ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge plus £1,670 contribution to prosecution costs. Trust Trawlers, the owners of the vessel, were fined £1,000 for each of the 4 offences and ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge.

The total fines and costs imposed by the court were £16,467.

MMO recognises that the vast majority of the fishing industry is compliant with the rules that govern its commercial activities. We aim to encourage compliance with fisheries legislation through education, advice and guidance to the industry wherever possible. Where necessary we may take enforcement action which could result in a court appearance, potential fines for masters and owners, and forfeiture of equipment imposed by the court."

The blueprint for a new generation of multi-million Town Deals was announced today (1 November 2019) by Communities and Local Government Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP.

TheTowns Fund prospectusprovides information to councils in 100 places chosen to pioneer Town Deals – they will receive a share of £16.4 million capacity funding to kick-start their innovative plans and bring their communities together.

Each place will have the opportunity to bid for funding of up to £25 million as part of the government’s £3.6 billion Towns Fund.

The funding could be used to redevelop vacant buildings and land, drive private sector investment by supporting small businesses and ensure young people have the skills they need to get good jobs. Communities will also be able to consider how they can boost their transport links and increase access to high-speed broadband.

Communities and Local Government Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:

This government is committed to levelling up all parts of the country. We created the £3.6bn Towns Fund to help businesses grow, connect communities and give people the skills they need to succeed.

But no place is exactly the same. That is why we want to help local people to decide how this investment of up to £25 million in each town can be used to help create new businesses, new jobs and new homes for generations to come.”

The announcement follows the launch of the My Town campaign, giving local people the chance to share what they love about their town and how they want to see it grow. In just one week, the campaign has drawn over 10,000 responses from across the country.

Lead councils in each place will now bring together a Town Deal Board including representatives from across the public, private and voluntary sectors to develop bespoke Town Investment Plans by summer 2020.

These plans will provide a clear vision for building on their town’s unique strengths to transform its economic growth prospects and form the basis of negotiations with the government.

Minister for the Northern Powerhouse and Local Growth Rt Hon Jake Berry MP said:

We are giving local people the money and power to decide what is best for their town because they know their community’s unique strengths.

Together we can build on the billions of pounds the government has already invested in our towns and the thousands of new jobs and businesses it has delivered, to level up these places across the Northern Powerhouse and beyond.

See the100 places being supported to develop Town Deals.

A total of 100 places – including 45 places across the Northern Powerhouse and 30 places in the Midlands Engine – will be the pioneers of new Town Deals building on the Prime Minister’s announcement in July of an additional £1.325 billion to support towns as part of a renewed vision to level up every part of our country, which took the total value of the Towns Fund to £3.6 billion.

In due course the government will announce details of a competition for further towns beyond the initial 100 to develop plans for their own Town Deals.

The government wants to make sure that all parts of the UK can benefit from resources to boost productivity and living standards. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government is in ongoing discussions with colleagues across government about how we can better support our towns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and make sure areas throughout the UK share in the opportunities of Brexit.

Speaking at the MADE entrepreneur festival in Sheffield, Business and Enterprise Minister Michael Fallon announced that there will be new independent scrutiny of the rules and regulations that are barriers to growth for challenger businesses.

These are innovative enterprises that do not follow established ways of business working, and which might be held back by burdensome bureaucracy.

Michael Fallon said:

“Challenger businesses create wealth and jobs - we should champion them at every opportunity. They put new products on our shelves, innovate our service industry and create new markets using the latest technology. I don’t want these pioneers falling foul of outdated regulations.

“I am now looking in more depth at the rules and regulations that are holding back our most forward-thinking entrepreneurs. That’s why in addition to the package of proposals I’m publishing today, I am also strengthening the role of the independent Regulatory Policy Committee to make sure that regulation barriers to challenger businesses growth are removed.”

This experimentalRed Tape Challenge workuncovered a wide range of issues - not all purely regulatory, but relevant to this theme. Key proposals are to:

See the report:Removing red tape for challenger businesses (PDF, 284 Kb).

The Minister also announced Northamptonshire as the “most enterprising place in Britain”.

Michael Fallon also gave an added boost to entrepreneurs by announcing that a network of 22,000 mentors is now accessible on theMentorsme website. He added:

“Business mentors play a vital role in helping SMEs to build their knowledge base as the support comes from someone who has been there and done it before.

It is great that we now have a vast network of accessible business mentors but we want to grow that number even further and give greater choice to our entrepreneurs.”

To make sure that entrepreneurs, particularly women in business, are aware that this support is available, Culture Secretary Maria Miller has today announced that £100,000 will be invested to help them find the right mentor to help their business prosper. This will bring the total government investment in the mentoring programme to £1.8 million.

Michael Fallon will be making the announcements at theMADE entrepreneur festivalin Sheffield. There he will meet young entrepreneurs and take part in the Intuit 100-up session, where young business people will be matched up with volunteer business mentors, trained through the Get Mentoring initiative."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cable-outlines-vision-for-future-of-british-industry,News story,Cable outlines vision for future of British industry,"Vince Cable outlines his plans in a Industrial Strategy speech to business leaders and committed to a long term, strategic partnership between Government and industry.","Department for Business, Innovation & Skills and The Rt Hon Dr Vince Cable",11 September 2012,"11 Sep 2012

The Business Secretary today set out his vision for the future of British Industry, looking at where the UK has a competitive advantage now, and where it can build on that in the next twenty years (read the full speech).

Speaking ahead of his Industrial Strategy speech at Imperial College in London, Vince Cable said:

“Government makes decisions every day that affect the British economy, but has for too long done this in an ad hoc way. Government needs to be more like business, by making strategic plans and sticking to them.

“Our first part of that plan is lifting the barrier that poor access to finance puts on growth. By helping firms to invest capital, businesses expand, and create jobs.

“But I am also setting out a clear and ambitious vision, a commitment far beyond the usual political timescale that will continue to bear fruit decades later.

“It will give our businesses certainty, allow them to make their own plans, and know that the full weight of Government is behind them. We will work in a strategic partnership with industry, focusing our support on specific sectors. This is our commitment to growth in action.”

Actions outlined in the Industrial Strategy speech include:

A new institution needs to be created to help companies invest in capital and drive their expansion. The scale and modus operandi of the institution are still under discussion, but it could operate through alternative providers such as the new challenger banks and non-bank lenders.

Not only would this boost their lending capacity, but would also corral existing provision such as co-investment and guarantees to support business expansion.

Government will create a series of collaborative but challenging sector strategies in advanced manufacturing, knowledge-intensive traded industries, and the enabling industries. This will include building strategic partnerships with industries and targeting support for them to help realise their substantial growth prospects.

A research paper published today (PDF, 1.1 Mb)details the wide range of factors considered when identifying sectors:

The speech outlined that our world class skills policy must be linked closely to the industrial strategy, in order that industry gets the skills they need to continue growing. This objective underpins the employer ownership pilot scheme where employers have been putting together radical plans to develop their own training programme.

It was announced today that 34 bids had been successful in the first round of the Employer Ownership pilot scheme.This secured £67 million of public funding and generated £98 million in private investment, meaning employers can access exactly the sort of skills they need.

The strategy looks at accelerating the journey from pure academic research to a commercial product being brought to market to help boost ground-breaking technologies of the future.

The Government has already made £180 million available to support the commercialisation of innovations in the life sciences sector and building on this new approach, there will now be a new Innovation and Knowledge centre in Synthetic biology to explore the opportunities this sector presents.

There is a need to recognise Government’s role as a customer and develop a more intelligent partnership with its own supply chain. This can be achieved by reforming procurement to make sure that businesses have confidence to take long-term investment decisions."

Flu and coronavirus (COVID-19) arecurrently circulating at high levelsand are likely to continue to increase in coming weeks. High numbers of scarlet fever, which is caused by group A streptococcus, alsocontinue to be reported.

Professor Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said:

It’s important to minimise the spread of infection in schools and other education and childcare settings as much as possible. If your child is unwell and has a fever, they should stay home from school or nursery until they feel better and the fever has resolved.

Helping children to learn about the importance of good hand hygiene is also key, so practice regular handwashing at home with soap and warm water. Catching coughs and sneezes in tissues then binning them is another simple way to help stop illness from spreading.

Adults should also try to stay home when unwell and if you do have to go out, wear a face covering. When unwell don’t visit healthcare settings or visit vulnerable people unless urgent.

Remember that flu vaccination is still available for all eligible groups and is the best protection against the virus. We have seen good uptake in older age groups but vaccination among young children remains low. Flu can be very unpleasant and in some cases can lead to more serious illness. Getting your child vaccinated protects them and others they come into contact with, and it’s still not too late.

Eligible children include:

The UK was the first country in the world to authorise the use of the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines, the first European country to vaccinate 50% of its population and has delivered the fastest booster programme in Europe.

Over 31 million boosters have been administered across England and almost 38 million UK wide helping break the link between infections and hospitalisations. In England, the number of cases, hospitalisations and deaths continue to decline and are far below the levels of previous waves, with boosters offering strong protection against severe illness and hospitalisation.

Thanks to our hugely successful vaccination programme, the immunity built up in the population and our new antiviral and therapeutics tools, the UK is in the strongest possible position to learn how to live with Covid and end government regulation.

To save lives and protect the NHS, unprecedented measures were taken on a global scale that interfered with people’s lives and livelihoods. Billions of pounds were spent on supporting a locked down economy as the public stayed at home.

The Prime Minister has been clear that restrictions would not stay in place a day longer than necessary. The British public have made extraordinary sacrifices during the 2020 lockdowns, the Roadmap, and recent Plan B measures in response to the Omicron variant.

The Plan, published today, sets out how vaccines and other pharmaceutical interventions will continue to form our first line of defence. Today the Government has accepted the JCVI recommendation to offer an additional booster to all adults aged over 75, all residents in care homes for older adults, and all over 12s who are immunosuppressed.

An autumn annual booster programme is under consideration, subject to further advice. Further detail on deployment on the spring booster programme will be set out in due course. The Government will continue to be guided by the JCVI on future vaccine programmes.

The plan covers four main pillars:

The public are encouraged to continue to follow public health advice, as with all infectious diseases such as the flu, to minimise the chance of catching Covid and help protect family and friends. This includes by letting fresh air in when meeting indoors, wearing a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where you come into contact with people you don’t normally meet, and washing your hands.

The Prime Minister has today confirmed domestic legal restrictions will end on 24 February as we begin to treat Covid as other infectious diseases such as flu. This means:

Our testing programme has been a crucial part of our response to the virus. Over 2 billion lateral flow tests have been provided across the UK since 2020 ensuring people could stay safe and meet family and friends knowing they were free of the virus.

As set out in the Autumn and Winter Plan, universal free provision of tests will end as our response to the virus changes. From the start of April, the government will end free symptomatic and asymptomatic testing for the general public. Limited symptomatic testing will be available for a small number of at-risk groups and we will set out further details on which groups will be eligible shortly. Free symptomatic testing will also remain available to social care staff. We are working with retailers to ensure that everyone who wants to can buy a test.

The Test & Trace programme cost £15.7 billion in 2021/22. With Omicron now the dominant variant and less severe, levels of high immunity across the country and a range of strategies in place including vaccines, treatments, and public health knowledge, the value for taxpayers’ money is now less clear. Free testing should rightly be focused on at-risk groups.

The Government remains ready to respond if a new variant emerges and places unsustainable pressure on the NHS, through surveillance systems and contingency measures such as increased testing capacity or vaccine programmes. Our world-leading ONS survey will allow us to continue to track the virus in granular detail to help us spot any surges in the virus.

Further changes being made include:

From 1 April, the Government will:"

It will support 119 bids from businesses and local partnerships with projects to expand their operations, create new jobs and attract private investment. Discussions are ongoing with a further 10 bidders about their projects.

Of the 201,000 jobs created or protected, around 37,000 will be directly created jobs, and more than 164,000 will be in the supply chain. The Government investment will support nearly £6 billion of private investment secured by the successful projects.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said:

“I am delighted to be able to announce this boost to business, which will jump start growth and create jobs that last in the places that really need it.

“This targeted support for businesses across the country allows them to expand and create jobs. It unlocks private sector investment - with at least £5 put in for every £1 of public money. People in the rest of Britain have been let down for far too long by governments in thrall to one Square Mile of it.

“The first pot of Regional Growth Fund money is already making a difference across the country - helping to rebalance our economy so that every region and sector benefits.”

The successful bids are subject to legal checks before they can be awarded their final allocation of funding. This will establish whether the Government is confident that the organisations can deliver on the proposals in the bid and be agreed through contract. The Government expects the money to start being passed on to the bidders in the spring.

Some of the successful bids include:

Business Secretary Vince Cable said:

“We need to be doing all we can to enable businesses and organisations to create much needed jobs and inject private investment into the economy.

“We have announced today that a further 119 projects will benefit from the fund, and expect to deliver a huge number of jobs across their businesses and in the supply chain.

“This is a very significant boost to local communities, and the Regional Growth Fund will help businesses to drive local growth.”"

If local authorities ask us for guidance on interpreting EU Law on water quality and its implementation in England, we give it - but we don’t help or encourage them get a beach de-designated. It’s up to local authorities and private owners to apply for de-designation if they want to, but they must provide strong evidence that the beach isn’t used for swimming and paddling by significant numbers of people.

Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter said:

_“The NHS of the future needs the right workforce in place to make sure patients get the best care. The government is taking action now so that patient’s needs will continue to be met in 2025, and money is not wasted training more doctors than the NHS requires, who could end up having to go abroad to find work. _

“Regular robust contingency planning ensures there is a close match between medical school places, the future demands for care of patients in the NHS, and junior doctors’ training posts so that supply meets demand.”

A person with more than £23,250 (the upper capital limit) is usually assumed to be able to arrange their own care.

The upper capital limit was increased to £23,250 in April 2010. In the context of the Spending Review 2010, Ministers have decided not to increase the capital limits during the period covered by the spending review (i.e. to April 2015)

Local authorities can arrange residential care for people with more than £23,250, but they usually only do this on behalf of people who lack capacity and have no one else to act for them.

Under the National Assistance Act 1948, where a local authority arranges residential care for a person, it is required to carry out a financial assessment and charge the person what they are able to pay (see regulations and guidance on charging for residential care, below).

Capital assets and income are taken into account when assessing charges for residential care. The value of the resident’s only or main home will be taken into account as capital unless it is disregarded. It will be disregarded if it is lived in by the resident’s spouse or partner, by certain relatives if they are aged over 60 or incapacitated, or by a child of the resident who is under 18. In addition, where a resident’s former home is not disregarded, local authorities have discretionary powers to make a deferred payments agreement with the resident. Thisenables a resident to avoid having to sell their home to pay for residential care during their lifetime.

Personal Expenses Allowance

As part of the charging arrangements, each local authority must leave the resident with a weekly personal expenses allowance (PEA). The PEA is intended to enable residents to have money to spend as they wish, for example on stationery, personal toiletries, treats and small presents for friends and relatives. ThePEAis currently £23.50 per week.

Regulations and guidance on charging for residential care

Local authorities assess a person’s ability to pay charges using theNational Assistance (Assessment of Resources) Regulations 1992.

The Charging for Residential Accommodation Guide(CRAG)provides guidance to local authorities to help them interpret the charging regulations and encourages a consistent and fair approach."

The Chief Pharmaceutical Officers’ statement is as follows:

“Rebalancing” Medicines Legislation and Pharmacy Regulation[1]

Recent discussions about the supervision of the sale and supply of medicines in registered pharmacies have taken place against a background of a wider, but associated, agenda. This includes the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency’s (MHRA) work on the consolidation of medicines legislation and the planned review of penalties and sanctions, the recommendations from the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS) & the Professional Forum of the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland  (PFPSNI)  review of the implementation of the Responsible Pharmacist (RP) Regulations and the General Pharmaceutical Council’s (GPhC) consultation on standards for registered pharmacies.

Developments in the broader context of legislation and regulation generally, including the Government’s initiatives to reduce regulatory burden, greater reliance on professional regulatory standards and, linked to that, the aim of avoiding use of detailed legislation to regulate professional activity except where this is unavoidable, suggest that now is the time to consider the interplay of the medicine supply components of medicines legislation and GPhC& PSNI regulation, and how they impact on patient and public safety and professional practice.

Professional practice in pharmacy has changed in recent years to become considerably more clinical in nature. This is set to expand further.

Although at a very early stage, the UK Health Departments’ Chief Pharmaceutical Officers, together with the MHRA, are considering exploring with professional and regulatory bodies in pharmacy the balance of medicines legislation and statutory independent professional regulation and consistency with other health professionals. The aim would be to examine the respective scope of legislation and regulation, and the interface between them, with a view to ensuring these are optimally designed to provide safety for users of pharmacy services, while facilitating and reducing the barriers to responsible development of practice, innovation and a systematic approach to quality in pharmacy.

Elements for discussion are likely to include the role of quality systems within the diversity of pharmacy practice in different service settings in providing robust, systematic assurance and protection of public and patients’ interests; roles and responsibilities; enhanced professionalism; governance and accountability; and links with wider work, such as the review of sanctions and penalties, being led by MHRA.

Ideas are at an early stage and any further work will depend on the outcome of these initial discussions.  Updates will be shared as discussions move forward. Stakeholders will be involved when proposals are further developed.

Defra’s Darwin Initiative has already spent more than £80m to help protect biodiversity in 156 countries since its inception in 1992. Over the next four years the scheme will receive a boost of at least £25m in funding.

Caroline Spelman said:

“I’m proud of our excellent work under the Darwin Initiative - its project leaders have worked wonders in helping to prevent damage to vulnerable wildlife and Earth’s ecosystems and we are committed to strengthening our global partnerships in the economic and scientific response to protecting our natural environment.

“Some of the planet’s richest wildlife is found in developing countries, and over the next four years we’ll make more money and expertise available than ever before to ensure economic development goes hand in hand with protecting value natural habitats and adapting to the challenges of climate change.”

The Darwin Initiative has already supported a wide range of important work such as a scheme to ensure the survival of critically endangered “mountain chicken” frogs on the Caribbean island of Montserrat.

Funding has also been used to help protect river dolphins in Brazil, prevent the extinction of vultures in India and provide training in The Gambia to help monitor fragile ecosystems.

The latest round of bids for Darwin Initiative funding starts today. For more information go tohttp://darwin.defra.gov.uk.

Notes

Since its inception at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 the Darwin Initiative has invested £80,426,158 in 728 projects across 156 countries.

Most Darwin projects are based in Asia, Africa and South America in regions boasting particularly rich biodiversity. A smaller number of projects are located in Central America, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and the Pacific.

The Darwin Initiative aims to help countries meet their objectives under one or more of the three major biodiversity Conventions: the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD); the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES); and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), through the funding of collaborative projects which draw on UK biodiversity expertise.

Darwin projects usually address the following areas:

The indicator is for non-specialist acute trusts, and covers all deaths of patients admitted to hospital and those that occur up to 30 days after discharge from hospital. The indicator is also being published onNHS Choices.

The SHMI is being published quarterly as an official statistic,  but to reflect the fact that more work needs to be carried out to refine the methodology, the indicator is being regarded as ‘experimental’ for its first publication, and it will take time for Trusts to interpret exactly what the new SHMI means.

The indicator has been developed in collaboration with a range of national stakeholders following a review commissioned in 2010 by Sir Bruce Keogh, on behalf of the National Quality Board. The review was chaired by Ian Dalton in his role as Chief Executive of NHS North East SHA, and involved a wide range of stakeholders.

The monitoring of mortality in conjunction with a wider range of indicators is established as good practice in the context of Trusts’ local accountability, clinical governance and reporting. The SHMI marks an advance in adding to the information that the NHS has at its disposal to help understand mortality associated with hospitalisation.

Participants in the review had different perspectives on the statistical approaches to developing the SHMI. However there was widespread agreement on the need for experts to come together to review existing measures and to agree a new indicator that could help the NHS to have a deeper understanding of hospital mortality. A consensus statement has been signed by participants.Read the consensus statement

The National Quality Board said:

‘The National Quality Board welcomes the publication of the new Summary Hospital-level Mortality Indicator. This represents the culmination of a review into hospital mortality indicators recommended by the first Francis Inquiry into the events at Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust.

‘The group of experts from across the NHS and the commercial sector, who conducted this review on the Board’s behalf, have thoughtfully worked through some of the key strengths and weaknesses of hospital mortality measures. The resulting achievement is a new indicator that adds to the information available to help understand mortality associated with hospitalisation.

‘The NHS Information Centre will continue to work with the review experts and peers across the NHS to review the methodology and we support this important work to ensure that the indicator can be more widely understood by the public, patients and NHS professionals alike.’

Sally Brearley, Chair of Health Link and lay member of the National Quality Board, said:

‘It is obviously in the patient’s interest if everyone has confidence in the way quality is measured and how measures are used to bring about real improvements. Hopefully, by publishing SHMI and using it with a range of other indicators, patient’s interests can be better represented in future. After publication, it would be great to get feedback from patients and members of the public, to let us know if they have all they need to make the best use of such information.’"

Lord Henley at BiogenGreenfinch’s Westwood plant (click to play video on YouTube)

Environment Minister Lord Henley has toured an anaerobic digester, as the Government considers how such technology can provide a green energy boost for Britain.

During the fact-finding trip to Northamptonshire, Lord Henley saw how the cutting-edge plant transforms out-of-date supermarket food into electricity.

BiogenGreenfinch’s Westwood plant, near Rushden, can process 45,000 tonnes of food waste each year which generates enough electricity to power nearly 3,000 homes. Most of the electricity is sold to the National Grid.

The visit took place as the Government is drawing up an action plan examining how to achieve a huge increase in anaerobic digestion across the country.

Lord Henley said:

“Today I’ve seen first-hand how food scraps and out-of-date supermarket food is a valuable resource that can generate energy - rather than rubbish to be thrown away.

“As we strive to be the greenest government ever, this is exactly the type of technology we should be looking at, particularly as it cuts greenhouse gas emissions.

“We’ve already had constructive discussions with industry, farmers and the financial sector. Teams at Defra and DECC (Department for Energy and Climate Change) are now working hard to produce an action plan to examine how we can take practical steps to achieve a step change in the use of anaerobic digestion.”

The Government held roundtable talks earlier this month with representatives from business, farming, the financial sector and experts from the anaerobic digestion sector to discuss how to move forward with the plans.

Defra and DECC will jointly draw up an action plan by the autumn, looking at the economic capacity for the anaerobic digestion industry and the steps to be taken by Government and industry to realise this ambition.

Facts about the Westwood Anaerobic Digestion plant near Rushden, Northamptonshire:

Anaerobic digestion is a process for turning food, farm and other organic waste into energy and fuel. The UK produces about 100 million tonnes of this waste each year which could instead generate up to 7% of the renewable energy required in the UK by 2020.

Biomass waste such as animal manure, sewage sludge and waste food can be digested in the absence of oxygen to produce a methane-rich biogas which can be used to generate heat and power for industry and homes, or to provide a transport fuel.  The biogas can be upgraded to biomethane which is potentially suitable for injection into the National Gas Grid.

Anaerobic Digestion can be carried out in a small scale system, for example located on a farm, or at a business producing large volumes of food waste.  Alternatively it can be carried out in large centralised systems, for example at sewage treatment works, or to treat municipal food waste, or manures and slurries from several farms.

The diversion of biodegradable wastes to anaerobic digestion can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from landfill.  Digesting one tonne of food waste rather than sending it to landfill will save between 0.5 and 1 tonne of CO2 equivalent.

There are currently around 37 anaerobic digestion plants in the UK using food and farm waste, with around 60 planned or under construction.  A further 220 water treatment plants have anaerobic digestion facilities for sewage."

On sustainability - together with my Right Honourable Friend the Secretary of State  for Energy and Climate Change - we are determined to play the lead role across the whole of government. We will mainstream sustainability, strengthen the government’s performance in this area and put processes in place to join up activity across government much more effectively. I am not willing simply to delegate this responsibility to an external body.  I have accordingly decided that I will withdraw Defra funding from the Sustainable Development Commission (SDC) at the end of the current financial year, and instead take a personal lead, with an enhanced departmental capability and presence.

I also fully support the role of the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee in this area: powerful scrutiny within the democratic process.

The SDC was founded in October 2000 and recently became an executive non-departmental public body (NDPB). It is jointly owned with the Devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Each of them has to decide on the best future arrangements to meet their needs and over the next few months my department will work very closely with them to ensure a smooth transition.

The SDC has made a positive contribution to sustainable development across Government and society over the past ten years, and I pay tribute to their work and to their current and previous Chairs, Will Day and Jonathon Porritt.

I am also announcing today that I intend to abolish the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution in 2011, subject to the necessary processes and ongoing discussions with Devolved Administration ministers. When the RCEP was set up in 1970, there was very little awareness of environmental issues, with few organisations capable of offering relevant advice.  The situation now is very different, and the Government has many such sources of expert, independent advice and challenge. Protecting the environment remains a key Government aim, and Defra intends to draw on the full range of expertise available, including Foresight, the research councils, the Living With Environmental Change programme (in which Defra and DECC are partners with the research councils) the Royal Society and other academies. In making this decision, I pay tribute to the work of the Royal Commission and its current Chair, Sir John Lawton. Over the last 40 years the Commissioners have made a significant contribution to raising the profile of environmental issues in the UK.

A range of public bodies affiliated to Defra was established by the 1948 Agricultural Wages Act. Over time, this piece of legislation has become outdated, inflexible and burdensome for farmers and workers. So today I am announcing that we will be seeking agreement with the Welsh Assembly Government to abolish the Agricultural Wages Board. In England, we will be taking measures to bring agricultural workers within the scope of the National Minimum Wages Act and my department will be working closely with BIS to make the necessary amendments to the Act itself. We are discussing with the Welsh Assembly Government the arrangements they wish to propose in respect of Wales, and will agree with them measures for the abolition of the Committee on Agricultural Valuation and, separately, the Commons Commissioners. The fifteen Agricultural Wages Committees and the sixteen Agricultural Dwelling House Advisory Committees will also be abolished. Appropriate measures for effecting these changes will be brought forward as part of the Public Bodies (Reform) Bill. The cumulative effect of these changes will allow the agricultural industry to adopt flexible and modern employment practices in order to help ensure a vibrant and sustainable industry for the future.

I have decided that Defra should have a stronger role in developing policy for inland waterways and have already signalled our preference for moving British Waterways to a civil society model. Today I am announcing that I also intend to abolish the Inland Waterways Advisory Council. Defra will lead on developing future policy in this area by consulting all interests directly, by making full use of the evidence which can be provided by the navigation authorities and by forming a closer relationship with stakeholders. This decision highlights the importance I attach to the effective management of inland waterways and my determination to place them on a more sustainable long-term footing.

The changes I am announcing today will help streamline and modernise Defra’s network of arm’s length bodies and enhance accountability and transparency. I am continuing to look closely at Defra’s other arm’s length bodies and will make further announcements at the appropriate time."

Mr Hunt was given a tour of St Thomas’s Hospital, including the older people’s ward, where improvements have been made to care and working practices.

During his visit to the hospital, he met with some of the thousands of staff and volunteers who have been nominated by patients for going the extra mile as part of the nationalNHS Heroesscheme.

View our Storify of the day’s visit.

Mr Hunt said:

“I am delighted to have had the chance today to speak with patients and staff about their experiences.

“This hospital has special significance for my family, as my mother worked here and one of my children was born here, but I have been reminded today of the invaluable work of staff and volunteers up and down the country. They are at the heart of the NHS and we can never praise them highly enough.

“We have received more than 3,000 NHS Heroes nominations so far, which shows just how highly the public regard NHS staff and volunteers. I would urge as many members of the public as possible to nominate their own NHS Heroes by 21 September.”

During the visit, the Health Secretary heard how improvements have been made to the ward for older people. He was told about special initiatives on nutrition, training for staff on what it is like to be an older person, and how nursing staff ensure patients who need extra care are well looked after.

He also met with a number of members of staff who have been nominated by patients as NHS Heroes. The scheme, which was launched in July, aims to recognise the work of NHS staff and volunteers who go the extra mile.

Nominations can be submitted by filling in a short online form onthe NHS Heroes website. The closing date for nominations is 21 September."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/equality-information-published-in-2012,News story,Equality information published in 2012,"In line with the requirements of the Equality Act (Specific Duties) Regulations 2011, the Department of Health is publishing information to show how it has met the public sector equality duty in carrying out its departmental functions in 2012. This is the second year the department is publishing such information.",Department of Health and Social Care,31 January 2013,"The equality duty requires public bodies to consider how the decisions that they make, and the services they deliver, affect people who share different protected characteristics. It also requires public bodies to consider how their activities as employers affect people who share different protected characteristics. The specific duties require public bodies to publish information to show they did this.

The department believes that by publishing this information proactively, we can provide greater transparency on our performance in making fair decisions and promoting equal opportunities across the department and the health and care system in England. Our aim is to enable our stakeholders to assess our performance on equality across key functions for all protected characteristics.

The department takes a proportionate approach to meeting its equality duties. Arrangements are in place to ensure that decision makers fully understand how departmental policies are affecting people with different protected characteristics and that they routinely consider how they can mitigate any adverse impact identified. This includes putting in place arrangements to disaggregate the information used in decision making by protected characteristic as far as possible.

For each function or policy that has the potential to have a substantial effect on equality, officials are required to think about the three aims of the public sector equality duty and keep records showing how they have done so. Where it is clear from initial consideration that a policy will not have any effect on equality, no further analysis is undertaken. For major work programmes that may have significant impact on people with different protected characteristics, policy officials may chose to publish separate documents (equality analyses or impact assessments) which set out in detail how the equality duty was discharged.A list of such documents published in 2012 are available.

Another requirement of the aforementioned regulations is the publication of equality objectives which the department completed in April. An Action Plan to deliver those objectives can be found atEquality Objectives 2012-16. The department will soon start publishing regular progress reports towards meeting these objectives.

In June, the department successfully completed its delivery of the 18 month Voluntary Framework Agreement with the Equality and Human Rights Commission which has helped us make progress towards our aim of fully mainstreaming equality, diversity and rights into the foundation of department’s core business as an employer, policy maker and the leader of the health and social care system England. A summary of the quarterly reports submitted to the commission under the Voluntary Agreement in 2012 will also be published shortly.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/review-needed-of-livestock-transport,Press release,Review needed of livestock transport,Rules surrounding transportation must be based on existing and emerging scientific evidence so as to reduce the stress that long journeys may cause animals.,"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs",18 June 2012,"Agriculture Minister Jim Paice today called on the European Commission to look at the rules surrounding transport of livestock, especially journey times, and to ensure existing rules are in line with the available scientific evidence.

We would like to see livestock slaughtered as close as possible to where they are farmed, but if animals are to be transported, the rules surrounding transportation must be based on existing and emerging scientific evidence so as to reduce the stress that long journeys may cause animals.

At the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Luxembourg Jim Paice made the following statement:

“The UK agrees with the EU Commission that the number one priority is better enforcement of the existing legislation on welfare during transport, across the EU. However, in addition, it would like to see a review of long journey rules to take account of existing and emerging scientific evidence, including that highlighted by the recent EFSA report, particularly in relation to revising the journey time down to a maximum of 12 hours for horses going to slaughter.

“We also wish to see discussion on greater protection for infant livestock, particularly calves, taking into account the Commission’s own written guidance on the treatment of unweaned calves on long journeys and considering the very long distances some unweaned calves have to travel, which can involve multiple cycles of 19 hour journeys.

“We believe it is important that the rules should be updated where there is sufficient evidence to support such change. We note that the recent EFSA report does not include any recommendation suggesting that all major species of livestock going to slaughter should face the same maximum journey length in all cases.”

The statement came after the agreement of a set of EU Council conclusions on the new EU animal welfare strategy and the EU Commission’s report on its review of welfare during transport rules, which while positive, fell short of suggesting that in the immediate future the Commission should review the existing rules on long journeys.  The Government thinks the rules should be looked at in the light of the scientific evidence since the legislation was introduced in 2007, and which has been reviewed by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA)http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/1966.htm"

The route, which will start at Rufus Castle in Portland and will end at Lulworth Cove, will improve access to 32 kilometres of the British coastline for everyone’s enjoyment and will allow those interested in spotting the Olympic Sailing to do so as they make their way along the path.

Environment Minister Richard Benyon said:

“Opening up miles of English Coastline like this will allow thousands of people to better enjoy this spectacular coastline and help support local economies by encouraging tourism.

“I want to see more people walking in and accessing our countryside as I know the value such activity has for our health, for our economy and for the spiritual uplift and well-being that comes from being out and about in the countryside.

“This will be the first stretch of England’s coastline to be accessed under the new coastal access provisions and it will be ready in time for the 2012 Games so people will have greater opportunities to enjoy the coastline and see the sailing events.”

The Environment Minister was also on hand today to congratulate Natural England who have been awarded the Inspire Mark by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games for its detailed work along this stretch of the South West Coast Path.

Natural England’s Chair, Poul Christensen said;

“This first stretch of the England Coast Path - which has been awarded the prestigious Inspire Mark by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games - will provide a legacy for everyone to enjoy new areas of Dorset’s stunning coastline. We are enormously grateful for the advice, knowledge and expertise that Dorset County Council,  local landowners and local people have provided to make this happen.”

County council leader Angus Campbell said:

“Dorset’s wonderful coast is one of its greatest assets.  Dorset County Council has worked closely with Natural England to secure the extra benefits that the new coastal access rights will bring for residents, visitors and businesses. An improved alignment in places, coupled with the ability to roll back the path in response to erosion, will add to the recreational, economic and health benefits that the South West Coast Path already offers.  We are delighted that this stretch will be established as the very first section of the England Coast Path.”

Further to the coastal access path in Weymouth, Natural England have already started work on implementing coastal access in a further five areas:* Cumbria - Whitehaven to Allonby* Hartlepool/Durham/Sunderland - North Bents (Whitburn Bay) to Seaton Carew* Norfolk -  Weybourne to Sea Palling* Kent - Ramsgate to Folkestone* Somerset -  Minehead to Brean Down near Weston Super Mare.

Two sections of the path in the Weymouth Bay area will be closed from mid July to mid September for security reasons but temporary alternative routes will be in place and people will be able to enjoy the rest of the coastal path during the Olympic Games."

Mrs Spelman also announced that an independent panel of experts will examine forestry policy in England and report back to her in the autumn.

Speaking in the House of Commons the Environment Secretary said:

“I would first like to say that I take full responsibility for the situation that brings me before the House today.

“Let me make it clear that we have always placed the highest priority on preserving access and protecting our forests. But the forestry clauses in the Public Bodies Bill, published well before we launched the consultation, gave the wrong impression as to the Government’s intentions.

“That is why I am today announcing three steps which will allow for more measured and rational debate about the future direction of forestry policy.

“First, I have taken a decision to end the consultation on the future of the Public Forest Estate and I take full responsibility for that. I am doing so because it is quite clear from the early responses to the consultation that the public and many MPs are not happy with the proposals we set out.

“Second, the Government will support the removal of the forestry clauses from the Public Bodies Bill, currently at committee stage in the House of Lords.

“And thirdly I would like to announce that I am establishing an independent Panel to consider forestry policy in England. It will report to me with its findings this autumn. The Panel will advise me on the future direction of forestry and woodland policy in England, on the role of the Forestry Commission, and on the role of the Public Forest Estate. The Panel will include representatives of key environmental and access organisations alongside representatives of the forestry industry. I will shortly publish its membership and terms of reference.

“If there is one clear message from this experience, it is that people cherish their forests and woodlands and the benefits they bring. My first priority throughout this period of debate has been securing a sustainable future for our woodlands and forests.  On many occasions in the House last autumn, Ministers gave assurances that our aim in all of this has been to do more to maintain and enhance the public benefits delivered by forestry - from recreational access to wildlife protection; from tackling climate change to sustaining a wide range of small businesses. That is why my ambition to provide a better future for our forests is undiminished.

“We have already heard positive suggestions about how we can do this - for heritage forests and all other woodlands. We have spoken to the RSPB, the National Trust, the Woodland Trust, the Wildlife Trusts, the Ramblers and other groups. The Forestry Commission has itself acknowledged that change is needed and will of course be fully engaged in this process going forward, as I know they have many ideas to contribute.

“We have also been listening to MPs on all sides of the House many of whom have set up their own initiatives with local groups. We want to support them in this.

“Finally, I am sorry, we got this one wrong, but we have listened to people’s concerns. I would like to thank colleagues for their support through what has been a difficult time. I now want to move forward in step with the public. I hope that the measures I have announced today, signalling a fresh approach, demonstrate my intention to do the right thing for our forests and woodlands.”

The membership of the independent panel to look into forestry policy in England will be announced soon.

By signing up to the service, parents-to-be and new parents will receive regular emails and text messages containing relevant and timely NHS approved advice as their pregnancy develops and as their child grows.

Links to videos showing midwives demonstrating practical advice such as bathing your baby, and parents discussing issues that affected them and how they supported each other, will also be sent at appropriate times.

The care and attention a child receives when young will affect their health, behaviour and ability to learn throughout their lives.A recent survey suggests that 85% of parents want more practical help on caring for their baby to provide the best possible start for their children.

Parents will be invited to sign up to the new service at booking appointments with midwives, and organisations where parents already go for advice and support will have the option of including a sign-up facility directly on their own websites.

Prime Minister David Cameronsaid:

“Parents are nation-builders. It’s through love and sheer hard work that we raise the next generation with the right values. That’s why this government is doing everything possible to support parents.

“We’re focused on making life easier for parents day-to-day, from extending childcare to increasing the number of health visitors. The parenting classes and films we’re launching this week are an important part of that, providing clear, professionally-led advice on everything from teething to tantrums.”

Health Secretary Andrew Lansleysaid:

“We all want to give our children the best start in life. But sometimes, particularly for first-time parents, bringing a new baby home can be a daunting as well as a happy experience.

_“That is why we are determined to help people become more confident in becoming a parent - from pregnancy to the start of their children’s lives. _

“From now on, this new information service will be at parents’ sides to support them in the first stage of their child’s journey, guiding them with relevant information and first-hand experience from other parents.”

Free parenting classes are also being made available for all parents of children aged 5 years and under in 3 trial areas:

All mothers and fathers in these areas will be entitled to a voucher  - available from children’s centres, health visitors and professionals who have contact with families, and from Boots stores - covering the cost of a course of parenting classes.

TheNational Childbirth Trust,Coram,Save the Children, and theFatherhood Instituteare among those who are delivering the classes.

Up to £5m has been made available for the trial which runs until March 2014. This includes funding for redemption of parenting class vouchers and an independent evaluation.

The trial will help government understand how classes could be made available to every parent. Decisions on national roll out will be informed by the independent evaluation.

To support first-time parents with the transition to parenthood, expert organisations will deliver relationship support sessions in 4 trial areas of the country from this summer.

Research shows that the birth of a new child can be a stress point for couples. A trial starting in July will offer subsidised relationship support sessions for all expectant mothers and fathers and those with children up to the age of 2 in the trial areas:

The sessions - which will be delivered byRelate,The Tavistock Centre for Couple Relationshipsand theFatherhood Institute- are designed to help parents understand that it is normal for their relationship to go through a transition period after they have a child and to give them strategies to work through this as a couple.

Parents will have the choice of face to face and/or online support and the trial will be managed and promoted by theNational Childbirth Trust.

The aim is to encourage couples to feel that it is normal to access relationship support in the first few years of their child’s life - just as they would go to an antenatal class.

The offer will be distributed by professionals working in the early years - for example, from nurseries, children’s centres, midwives and health visitors.

Up to £1m has been made available for the trial, which will run until March 2014."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/strategic-vision-for-volunteering-faqs,News story,Strategic vision for volunteering FAQs,Answers to frequently asked questions.,Department of Health and Social Care,17 October 2011,"Why is this a vision and not a strategy?

Volunteers are involved in an enormous array of health and care related activities.  We want more people to be able to give their time, more often and in ways that fit in with their lives to bring health and well-being benefits for themselves and others. However, it is not for Government to define what all these activities should be or to compel people to volunteer. What we can do is influence the environment in which this activity takes place.

That is why we are setting out this broad vision and encouraging leaders and decision makers across health, public health and social care, to work together and to consider more strategically where and how volunteering might help them to meet their respective priorities and improve the quality, equity and outcomes of services and support.



DH published a Strategic Vision for Volunteering in March 2010. Why has a new vision been published so soon?

A strategic vision for volunteering in health and care was originally published on 16 March 2010 under the previous Government. It has been necessary to revise this vision to reflect the changes in health, public health and social care policy and the coalition Government’s overarching Big Society agenda. ‘Social action for health and well-being’ sets out a renewed  vision for volunteering in health and care, which this Government will pursue for the longer term.



How can volunteering help in developing the Government’s vision for a bigger stronger society ?

The Coalition government believes that the innovation and enthusiasm of civil society is essential in tackling the social, economic and political challenges that the UK faces today. Volunteering has its part to play in social action, community empowerment and public service reform, which are key for building a Big Society . Our vision for volunteering will help to foster and support a culture in which volunteering can thrive as part of that Big Society.

The opportunities for young people to get involved in volunteering in health and social care were boosted by the Government’s recent announcement of expanding the National citizen Service to 30,000 places.  This offers year 11 school children the chance to volunteer in their local community, during the summer vacation.



How does the vision take forward Government’s proposals and initiatives in the Giving White Paper.

** **The vision forms part of a bigger programme of work outlined in the Giving White Paper, published in May 2011.  The White Paper will promote measures to make giving (in all senses) more compelling and easier, and provide better support to those that give.  Our vision will encourage and support partners in health and social care in taking forward the aspirations of the White Paper to invest in volunteering and wider social action.

The White Paper includes a number of measures by Government, including a commitment over the next two years of over £40 million of funding to support giving.  This funding will complement existing DH programmes to support voluntary organisations. As a result of the White Paper, the Cabinet Office launched  the Social Action Fund, on 6 October.  This aims to inspire organisations to create new social action opportunities; encouraging people to give what they have, be it time, money, assets, knowledge or specific skills.



How has DH engaged with the public and partners during the vision’s development?

Comprehensive consultation was undertaken toward the end of 2008 to establish consensus around the strategic themes that frame the vision for volunteering. This consultation took place over a four-month period and included involvement of over 750 people in nine regional events as well as online and written consultation. The Department of Health has subsequently worked with key partners across the voluntary sector, local government, NHS and trade unions to develop and refresh the vision. We will continue to work with our cross-sector Stakeholder Reference Group and growing Volunteering Network to inform our future work in these areas.



**Is there any new money attached to support this vision? **

There is no additional funding attached to the vision as it introduces no new mandatory requirements. The strategic vision puts forward a strong case for health and social care leaders, partners, and commissioners to consider when and how volunteering initiatives might support the achievement of priorities, where the benefits in terms of quality or outcomes are estimated to outweigh costs.

As the evidence base for investment in volunteering is improved, we hope to further influence mainstream spend in those areas where volunteer involvement has most to offer in terms of quality and outcomes eg. in peer support and behaviour change, active later life, improving mental health and well being and enhancing patient and public engagement.

The vision will also provide the framework for funding from the Department of Health’s own Health & Social Care Volunteering Fund, which is now open for local applications. Successful applicants will join the 43 existing local projects in receipt of grants from an early round of this fund in 2010. In line with our commitment to good practice in volunteer support, all organisations in receipt of grants through the local fund also receive a package of support to help them to build organisational capacity.



Is this just a way of delivering services on the cheap at a time when Government savings are being made?

Our commitment to promoting and supporting volunteering is not about replacing paid staff with volunteers or finding cheap ways to deliver existing services. The message of this vision is very much about recognising the considerable, and often untapped, potential within our communities, identifying where volunteering can add value in terms of quality and outcomes, enhanced community resilience and innovation in the way services and support are delivered.

We recognise that volunteering itself is not without cost. Support for volunteers (eg. recruitment, training, payment of out of pocket expenses etc.) is essential if their involvement is to be effective, fulfilling and safe and therefore value for money. We put forward a case for investing in volunteering where benefits in terms of quality or outcomes are estimated to outweigh these costs.



Are jobs under threat because of the involvement of volunteers?

The vision makes the distinction between volunteering and paid employment and includes a very clear statement about volunteers not being used to replace paid employees. The emphasis of the vision is very much on the added value that volunteers can bring to services and the complementary nature of the roles they undertake. Our vision encourages leaders to engage and work closely with workforce representatives wherever volunteers are to be involved alongside paid staff. The document also signposts readers to the Charter agreed between the TUC and Volunteering England, which clarifies workforce relations issues and provides a good starting point for discussions between employers and workforce representatives.



Does the vision place unnecessary additional burdens on NHS and local government?

There are no new mandatory requirements introduced as a result of this vision. The vision puts forward a strong case for health and care leaders, partners and commissioners to consider when and how volunteering initiatives might support the achievement of existing priorities, where benefits in terms of quality or outcomes are estimated to outweigh costs.

This is not a new responsibility, it is it is about looking at the services and support available to people starting from an appreciation of the strengths and assets that people can bring to them. Any organisation looking to deliver effective services, support and value for money for local people would want to consider this.



What is the Department of Health expecting local leaders and commissioners to do as a result of this vision?

Where public bodies take this agenda on, for pragmatic and financially sound reasons linked to existing duties and priorities, we would expect to see the value of volunteering considered more fully and reflected more prominently in strategic plans at local and organisational level. In particular, through Joint Strategic Needs Assessment, health and well-being strategies and other local and organisational plans. As a result we would expect to see:

We are working closely with partners to determine how best to support commissioners of health and social care to take a more holistic view to volunteering, including examining current decision-making tools in the sector.



If there are no mandatory requirements in this document, how is the Department of Health going to ensure change?

The Department of Health has produced this strategic vision to raise the profile of volunteering, stimulate and inform discussion and act as a focal point for the energy and enthusiasm that many leaders across government and the health and care system have for the volunteering agenda. This is a long-term vision that needs to be integrated into approaches to system and cultural change.

We are committed to playing an enabling and facilitative role in this and will work with key partners to take this agenda forward. In doing so, the emphasis will be on influencing key players and encouraging practical action reflected in better information sharing, a more accessible evidence base and locally tailored approaches. We will use the vision as a framework to co-ordinate its own activities and to promote and support action by others across the health and care system.



Where are any new volunteers going to come from? How can you be sure people are willing to volunteer?

The vision document highlights good practice in volunteer support that opens up opportunities to a more diverse range of people and reduces barriers that can prevent people from volunteering.

Evidence indicates a latent potential within our communities for more people to volunteer where the right opportunities are available to them. The vision aims to influence all of these factors.

Where NHS trusts and other organisations have made significant investments in volunteering programmes, considerable numbers of people have come forward for these roles. For example, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust increased the number of volunteers at the trust from 180 to 900 in just three years. Other organisations also report waiting lists of people wanting to give their time. Results from a national survey of volunteering published in 2007 found that over fifty percent of non-volunteers, ex-volunteers and occasional volunteers said that they would like to spend more time volunteering and forty percent said they would help if asked. Enquiries about volunteering through Volunteer Centres and online through www.do-it.org have increased since the start of the recession.



Aren’t there risks in engaging volunteers in health and social care provision?

Any provider carrying out regulated activities must register with the Care Quality Commission whose requirements apply to volunteers as well as paid staff. Our vision makes clear that good quality volunteer support is essential to ensuring that volunteering is effective and safe for volunteers and for those they work with.



What are the benefits to individuals who choose to volunteer?

Volunteering presents a wealth of opportunities for people to learn new skills, share ideas and experiences, meet other people and contribute more to their community. Involvement in volunteering can help contribute to improved physical and mental health well-being, help to keep people to active, engaged and independent and nurture a sense of shared social responsibility and increased community resilience as a result.

Volunteering can encourage interaction between generations, addressing prejudices and negative preconceptions.  It reduces social isolation, something that can be damaging to health and well-being, particularly in later life.



How will voluntary organisations be able to continue to invest in volunteering in the current economic climate?

We are sending the message to local authorities and PCTs that the voluntary sector should not shoulder a disproportionate share of funding cuts.

It is important that we do not lose vital local services that achieve high quality outcomes and we will therefore work with PCT’s in the transition to the new arrangements with the NHS Commissioning Board and clinical commissioning groups, as they develop, to ensure that the sector’s contribution to improved health, public health and social care is recognised."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/paice-announces-farming-regulation-review,Press release,Paice announces Farming Regulation Review,Bureaucratic burdens on the farming industry will be put under the microscope by a new Task Force announced by Agriculture Minister Jim Paice today.,"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs",9 June 2010,"The Task Force on Farming Regulation, to be chaired by Richard Macdonald, will identify ways to reduce the regulatory burden through a review of the relevant regulations and their implementation, as well as advise on how best to achieve a risk-based system of regulation in the future.

Mr Paice, speaking at Cereals 2010 near Royston, Cambridgeshire, said:

“There’s too much red tape tying up our farmers and preventing them from getting on with the business of producing our food and managing our countryside. That’s why we committed in the Coalition Agreement to reduce the regulatory burden on farmers by moving to a risk-based system of regulation. The burden on farming and food manufacturing businesses is not just the number of regulations but the emphasis on process rather than outcomes.

“I’m going to ask this industry-led Task Force to look at the way we make and implement regulations right across the board, both at what’s already in place, and how we should do things in the future.

“I’m very pleased that Richard Macdonald has agreed to head this Task Force, as he brings with him a unique knowledge of the farming and food industry, outstanding leadership skills and a track record of commitment to partnership working between Government and industry.”

Welcoming the news of his appointment, Richard Macdonald commented:

“I am very much looking forward to leading a task which I have long thought needs doing. It won’t be easy to achieve significant results overnight, and as well as the Task Force itself I plan to consult everybody in the farming and food sector interested in working with us. Together I hope that we can make a real difference”.

The Task Force will make its initial recommendations to Government by early 2011.

The full membership of the Task Force will be announced in the near future, along with its Terms of Reference and details of how the wider farming and food sector can engage with the work of the Task Force.

Richard Macdonald was appointed as the NFU’s Director General in July 1996 and held that post until December 2009. He had overall responsibility for the management of the NFU and for policy advice to the organisation, as well as critical roles in the BSE and Foot and Mouth disease crises. Other posts held include membership of the Government’s Sustainable Farming and Food Strategy Implementation Group and membership of the steering group for an English Collaborative Group as recommended by the Food and Farming Commission. He is currently a trustee of Farm Africa and a governor of the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester.

Since retiring from the NFU in February 2010, Richard has taken on a non executive director role with poultry producer Moy Park.

In June 2002 Richard was awarded the CBE for Services to Agriculture in the Queen’s Birthday Honours.

Richard lives in Oxfordshire and is married with two daughters. His interests include cricket and golf and gardening."

“We all have a role to play - from individuals to public, private and non-governmental organisations - if we are going to cut 5 billion calories from our national diet. It is an ambitious challenge but the Responsibility Deal has made a great start.

“This pledge is just the start of what must be a bigger, broader commitment from the food industry. But it is a great step in the right direction and will help millions of us eat and drink fewer calories.”

England has one of the highest rates of obesity in Europe and some of the highest rates in the developed world. Over 60% of adults and a third of 10 and 11 year olds are overweight or obese. Consuming too many calories is at the heart of the problem.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-climate-change-advice-to-help-businesses-boost-growth,Press release,New climate change advice to help businesses boost growth,The new toolkit will help businesses gain a better understanding of the risks and opportunities involved in adapting to a changing climate.,"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs",29 March 2011,"Climate change will bring opportunities for economic growth if British businesses think now about how climate change will affect them, Environment Minister Lord Henley said today. The message came at the launch of a new interactive online tool designed by Defra and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) to prepare businesses for both climate risks and opportunities.

The Climate Resilience Toolkit is a quick and simple online tool available on the Business Link website for businesses wanting to increase their resilience to the changing climate, or explore possibilities for growth by taking advantage of the opportunities climate change will bring.

The toolkit provides a tailored report for each business to help it focus on what it should be doing to prepare, such as checking the robustness of its supply chain, the threat of flooding to premises and possible changes in customer demand for products.

Environment Minister Lord Henley said:

“Climate change will have impacts on all UK businesses, such as the availability of resources, demand for different products, and the increased threat of floods, drought and other extreme weather. But smart businesses that take action now to limit the risks and identify the opportunities climate change could bring will steal a march on their rivals.

“The Climate Resilience Toolkit we have developed with CIMA is an excellent tool for quickly and simply assessing areas in your business that could be affected by climate change.”

While many organisations have looked at reducing their carbon emissions, few have seriously considered how to address the impacts of an already changing climate. A survey commissioned by Defra last year found that two thirds of the UK’s largest businesses (68%) have not yet acted on the risks and opportunities that climate change poses. Businesses must not only consider how to reduce their environmental impact, but also how to adapt and build resilience to the expected impacts of climate change as part of their wider business model.

Andrew Harding, Executive Director, CIMA Markets, explains:

“Forward-thinking businesses must be aware of the risks and alive to the opportunities that climate change brings.  Many SMEs fail to prepare for climate change, leaving it to the big players in industry to manage and mitigate those risks.  This can leave many SMEs in a vulnerable position.   It is vital that all businesses, whatever their size, assess these risks now and take action to manage those risks to avoid costly disruption.  This online tool will improve organisations’ risk planning around climate change and will help them become more economically resilient.

“Sustainability makes good business sense and it should be embedded at the very heart of any company strategy.  As companies incorporate these environmental considerations into their strategies for long-term business success, management accountants have an important role to play in ensuring that investments in sustainability capabilities produce greater returns than simply meeting compliance requirements.”

Andrew Slight, Head of External Affairs at PepsiCo UK & Ireland, said:

“PepsiCo is reducing carbon emissions in our own operations as well as throughout our supply chain.  But we also know that tackling climate change is about adaptation as well as mitigation.  For example, we are working with Climate East, Defra, Suffolk Country Council, Anglian Water and the Environment Agency to understand how climate change will affect the water availability for our Copella apple juice plant at Boxford in Suffolk and for the local community. By asking these questions now, we want to ensure the long term resilience and viability of our operations, and work with others towards having a positive water impact.

“The new toolkit will help businesses gain a better understanding of the risks and opportunities involved in adapting to a changing climate and, we hope, lead to more collaboration between business, Government, water companies and other stakeholders which will help us all manage future risks better.”"
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/minister-updates-parliament-on-single-payment-scheme-progress--2,Press release,Minister updates Parliament on Single Payment Scheme progress,Agriculture Minister Jim Paice today made a statement on the Single Payment Scheme to Parliament.,"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs and The Rt Hon James Paice",31 March 2011,"Agriculture Minister Jim Paice today made a statement on the Single Payment Scheme to Parliament:

“In my statement of 4 March, I updated the House on the Rural Payments Agency’s (RPA), progress in both addressing its daunting legacy of errors in relation to the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) and ensuring that accurate payments under the SPS 2010 reached farmers as soon as possible. In that statement I explained I was considering additional measures to speed the flow of SPS 2010 payments and, following discussions in the RPA Oversight Board, I can now report on the decisions that have been reached.

“Since 4 March, RPA has continued to make SPS 2010 payments as claims are validated and to undertake further work to identify those that are ineligible and not, therefore, due a payment for this year. As a result, the Agency calculates that there are now in the region of 6,300 eligible claims remaining to be paid, with a combined value of around £215 million.

“The frustrations felt by these farmers have been made very clear to me, both directly and through farmers’ representative bodies. They want both the remaining sums paid as soon as possible and a line to be drawn under the legacy issues so uncertainty over past years is removed and greater confidence is provided that subsequent scheme year payments will not be affected. The Oversight Board shares these aims and has been looking very closely how the former can be achieved without significantly impacting on the latter.

“Against that background, the Oversight Board has now approved two decisions which between them should ensure that less than one per cent of the monetary value of SPS 2010 payments remains outstanding at the end of the regulatory payment window which closes on 30 of June. This would be in line with, or would better, performance in previous years and would ensure the EU requirement to make 95.238 per cent of payments by 30 June is met thus avoiding late payment penalties.

“The first decision is that, after rigorous testing on a sample to ensure accuracy of the process, fully validated manual payments will be made to approximately 2,000 farmers under the 2010 scheme who would otherwise not be paid until after the payment window. These payments will be made over the next two months and take account of known entitlement corrections that have yet to be fully processed on the Agency’s systems. Should there be any additional changes identified once payment has been made, the farmers concerned will be informed.

“The second decision relates to those remaining SPS 2010 payments where there are outstanding queries on earlier scheme years. Where the SPS 2010 claim has been fully validated, payment for that scheme year will now be made. Should any changes be identified for earlier scheme year payments in due course, the farmers concerned will be informed. RPA plan to complete the work required before the opening of the SPS 2011 payment window on 1 of December.

“The net result of these decisions is that the flow of remaining SPS 2010 payments will now increase. The Oversight Board did additionally consider requests from various sectors of the industry to make partial payments. However, RPA’s analysis suggests that this would not significantly increase the speed at which remaining claims are paid to farmers, but would add disproportionately to the backlog of corrective work required and introduce additional risks of EU fines. Consequently, it was agreed that the Agency should not make partial payments.

“In order that all farmers with payments outstanding at the end of March understand how these decisions might affect them, RPA will be writing to each of those concerned next week to explain what issues remain on their claims and the likely month of payment.

“Alongside this work, RPA will continue to review the remaining backlog of potential error cases that need to be reviewed. Corrective work undertaken to date, combined with earlier decisions by the Oversight Board on ensuring entitlements were regularised wherever legally possible, has made a real impact to date. The Board will be monitoring these efforts closely to ensure a line is finally drawn under all the legacy data issues over the coming year.”

In recognition of the difficulty that farmers affected may face, Jim Paice has written to the directors of the main banks, asking them to alert their staff to the situation and asking them to be understanding in meeting reasonable requests by farmers for assistance and urging them to share his aim that no otherwise viable farming business fails because of cash flow issues related to the timing of SPS payments."

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/not-enough-music-in-music-lessons,Press release,Not enough music in music lessons,In a major survey over the last 3 years Ofsted found wide differences in the quality and quantity of music education in English schools.,Ofsted,2 March 2012,"One in 5 of the schools visited were judged inadequate for music. The findings and recommendations are published in a report today.

In too many music lessons there was insufficient emphasis placed on active music making, and too much focus on talking or written exercises. The scarcity of good vocal work in secondary schools, where nearly half of those inspected were judged inadequate for singing, and the underuse of music technology across all levels were found to be significant barriers to pupils’ musical progress. For example, insufficient use was made of audio recording to assess and improve pupils’ work.

Across the primary and secondary schools visited, around twice as many girls as boys were involved in extra-curricular activities. In secondary schools, only 6% of students with disabilities or special educational needs were involved in additional tuition, compared to 14% of students without these needs.

Nearly all the schools recognised the importance of promoting a diverse range of musical styles, but far fewer had a clear understanding about how students should make good musical progress. The report, ‘Music in schools: wider still, and wider’, is complemented by six new films (link below) exemplifying good practice in a wide range of settings, designed to help all schools.

Launching the report, Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, said:

Inspectors looking at music teaching in nearly 200 schools saw quality ranging from outstandingly good to extremely poor. Too often, inspectors simply did not see enough music in music lessons.

Too much use was made of non-musical activities such as writing without any reference to musical sound. Too much time was spent talking about tasks without teachers actually demonstrating what was required musically, or allowing the pupils to get on with their music making. Assessment was often inaccurate, over-complex or unmusical, particularly in secondary schools. All this limited time for practical music, detracting from pupils’ musical improvement and enjoyment.

School leaders need to monitor and challenge robustly the quality of music teaching and curriculum planning. I hope that schools and the new music hubs will use our recommendations to improve the quality of their music education.

The report recommends that schools give sufficient, regular time for developing aural awareness and musical understanding, and ensure that opportunities for pupils’ practical, creative application and response to music are given priority.

It recommends that schools do more to ensure the sustained participation and musical achievement of specific groups of pupils; particularly boys; pupils with special educational needs; pupils known to be in receipt of free school meals; and children who are looked after.

Best practice case studies of music teaching highlighted in the report include a range of lessons from every type of school in different styles (see notes below). Poor teaching also highlighted shows entire lessons, for example, where teachers did not play or sing a single note. In one lesson students sat passively while the teacher spent almost 20 minutes explaining complicated assessment objectives. One Year 9 class completed the copying of information about the lives of Eric Clapton and Johnny Cash but did not engage in musical activity.

The six films include examples which highlight the impact external providers can have on achievement and participation. These films cover a diverse range of schools, including a primary school where 98% of pupils are from minority ethnic groups, a high-attaining boys’ secondary school, and a special school for children with profound and multiple learning difficulties.

Notes to editors:

The report,‘Music in schools: wider still, and wider - quality and inequality in music education 2008-11’is available online.

Good practice films to accompany the report, are available on YouTube.

To complement the report, Ofsted revisited six schools from the 2008-11 music survey. The six schools represent a range of contexts; five were graded good or outstanding in their music survey inspection and the sixth school was visited as part of the ‘good practice’ sample. Each film lasts for about 15 minutes. Discussions with the headteacher (including consideration of how he or she manages and supports music in the school), teachers, and external partners are included, as well as showing a range of classroom and extra-curricular practice. The films also explore the further improvements that the schools have made since they were visited by Ofsted. Each film focuses a number of different aspects and priorities highlighted in this report.

The report is based on evidence from inspections of music between September 2008 and July 2011 in 90 primary schools and 90 secondary schools. The schools were selected to provide a sample of those in differing contexts and geographical locations across England. However, the schools selected for the survey did not include schools that were in special measures or had been given a notice to improve. A further nine primary schools and one special school were visited to observe examples of good practice that were nominated, through the Department for Education, by local authority music services, and by national music initiatives. Inspectors observed classroom curriculum lessons, assemblies, extra-curricular activities and instrumental lessons; held discussions with headteachers, teachers, students, pupils, parents and others involved in partnerships; and scrutinised documentation, as well as pupils’ and students’ work. Observations were also drawn from visits by inspectors to performance events including the annual National Festival of Music for Youth in Birmingham and The Schools’ Proms at the Royal Albert Hall.

Best practice case studies of music teaching highlighted in the report include a range of lessons from every type of school in a range of styles, for example two Year 9 lessons:

In one school a lesson started with a simple counting game. Next the teacher played a musical idea, several times over, while they continued counting. After picking up this idea the whole class was soon singing and counting. They listened then to a recording of music by Purcell; more advanced students with the score and others the base line notation until they all understood how the bass worked, internalising the music by focusing on vocalising and listening. The students left the lesson, literally knowing the music ‘inside out’.

Another Year 9 lesson was conducted almost wholly in musical sound. After increasingly complex polyrhythmic games on djembe drums, the teacher added vocals and tuned percussion riffs. The students listened carefully and sang back the riffs. Using these ideas, they then began creating group compositions. Through outstanding practical activity, without notation and little verbal instruction, the students grasped an excellent aural understanding and this helped them to produce creative, musical compositions.

From April 2013, patients will be asked a simple question: whether they would recommend hospital wards, accident and emergency units to a friend or relative based on their treatment.

Publishing the answers will allow the public to compare healthcare services and clearly identify the best performers in the eyes of patients - and drive others to take steps to raise their standards. The test will be developed with local hospitals and GPs, including any exclusions to the test, like patients in intensive care, while ensuring that the vast majority of wards are covered.

NHS staff are already asked in an annual survey to find out if they would be happy for their friends and family to be treated at the place they work.

In anopen letter to the Prime Ministertoday, the Nursing Quality Care Forum, which was launched in January to identify and share best nursing practice, recommended the friends and family test alongside a number of other proposals after consulting frontline nurses, care staff and patients.

The Forum’s recommendations include:

Prime Minister David Cameronsaid:

‘Nurses are the beating heart of our NHS. The kindness, gentleness and calm they provide are completely invaluable to the millions of people they look after each year. To me, nothing matters more in our NHS than the quality of that care - and no one knows better how to improve it than nurses themselves.

‘That’s why we set up the Nursing Care and Quality Forum: to find out what works best on the wards; to share that knowledge; to lead an improvement in standards from the bottom up. I’m delighted to see the progress the Forum has already made.

And to really make sure that patients get the right care, we’re moving ahead quickly on one of their main recommendations: the friends and family test. In every hospital, patients are going to be able to answer a simple question: whether they’d want a friend or relative to be treated there in their hour of need. By making those answers public we’re going to give everyone a really clear idea of where to get the best care - and drive other hospitals to raise their game.’

Forum Chair Sally Brearley said:

‘The friends and family test is a useful way for staff to look at their place of work, and for patients to look at the quality of care they receive, and for them to judge whether they would be content for a loved one to use that service, should they need treatment.

‘Our initial recommendations to the Prime Minister highlight the good work which many are already doing to ensure that nursing and care is of the best quality, and we want others to benefit from these lessons. The forum will now work with others to help make these ideas a reality and to continue to highlight good practice in nursing and care.’

The Prime Minister also revealed plans to roll out theNHS Safety Thermometer. It provides nurses with a simple template to check basic levels of care, identify where things are going wrong and take action. During a pilot across 160 NHS organisations last year, the national data showed an overall reduction in blood clots by 72%, pressure ulcers by 42% and urinary infections in patients with catheters by 33%.

Pressure ulcers, falls, urinary catheter infections and blood clots are among the most common preventable problems in hospitals and care homes and cost the NHS up to £1 billion every year. At least 200,000 patients experience one or more of these problems while being treated."

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/england-s-special-wildlife-sites-show-dramatic-improvement,Press release,England’s special wildlife sites show dramatic improvement,Natural England is responsible for monitoring the condition of SSSI land in England.,"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs",30 December 2010,"Over 95 per cent of England’s finest wildlife and geological sites, covering more than one million hectares of countryside, are now in favourable or recovering condition, Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman announced today.

This is a major improvement since 2003, when only 57 per cent of these Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) were in the same condition. It follows seven years of hard work by Defra, in conjunction with Natural England, the Environment Agency, the Forestry Commission and partners from the public, private and voluntary sectors.

Welcoming the achievement, Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said:

“These sites really deserve the title of special. They include spectacular and beautiful habitats from flower-rich meadows to remote upland peat bogs and give protection to wildlife that might not otherwise survive.

“This fantastic achievement is testimony to the hard work of everyone involved. People really do care about and value our natural environment and together we can safeguard our remaining natural heritage for future generations.”

As well as protecting wildlife, these sites also give opportunities for rural businesses, space for recreation and scientific research, and safeguard essential services such as clean water, flood management, carbon storage, pollination and food production.

Helen Phillips, Chief Executive of Natural England said:

“The turnaround in the fortunes of England’s SSSIs is one of the great conservation success stories of recent decades and owes much to the tireless efforts of an army of conservationists, landowners and volunteers. Thanks to their efforts, a host of rare species from sand lizards to golden plovers now have a greater prospect of flourishing; while much loved landscapes, such as the New Forest and the Yorkshire Dales, face a more secure future.”

Some of the sites that have shown improvement and the habitats and species that have benefited include:

Natural England is responsible for the day-to-day implementation of the Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) legislation and for assessing and monitoring the condition of SSSI land in England.

Favourable condition means that special habitats and features are in a healthy state and are being conserved for the future by appropriate management.

Recovering (or improving) condition means that all necessary management measures are in place to address the reasons for unfavourable condition; if these measures are sustained, the site will become favourable over time.

A full inventory for each site is now publically available, showing the reasons why it was designated, the management requirements needed to maintain its special features, and an up-to-date assessment of the condition of the site.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/keeping-pets-healthy-during-hot-weather,Press release,Keeping pets healthy during hot weather,"Extra care should be taken to protect pets in the current hot weather, Defra’s Chief Vet Nigel Gibbens said today.","Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs",3 June 2011,"Extra care should be taken to protect pets in the current hot weather, Defra’s Chief Vet Nigel Gibbens said today. In a statement issued jointly with the RSPCA and British Veterinary Association, Mr Gibbens urged the public to think about the effects of hot weather on their pets and to take the right steps to ensure their welfare.

Mr Gibbens said:

“You’d think that everybody would know about the dangers of leaving animals in hot cars, but it was still happening last year when we saw some really tragic cases of dogs dying because they were trapped inside cars in high temperatures. This just shouldn’t happen these days.

“As it gets hotter this summer, all pet owners need to think about how they can take simple steps to ensure their pets are happy and healthy during the warm weather.”

Mr Gibbens said there were some simple guidelines pet owners should follow:

BVA President Harvey Locke said:

“Dogs should never be left in cars by themselves, even when the day is warm as opposed to hot, it can quickly become very hot inside a vehicle. Leaving the car windows open and a bowl of water is not enough. As a dog can only cool down through its tongue and paw pads, it cannot cool down quickly enough to cope with the rising heat.

“Dogs still have thick coats on when humans are walking around in t-shirts and shorts. I would like owners to remember that a dog won’t stop enjoying itself because it is hot, so it is up to the owner to stop the animal before it suffers - something that is particularly important as more and more people jog or run with their dogs.”

Jude Clay from the RSPCA said:

“All too often, owners make the mistake of thinking that it is sufficient to leave a bowl of water or a window open for their pet but this is not enough to protect your pet from heatstroke, which can have fatal consequences.  The RSPCA’s message is: ‘Dogs die in hot cars. Don’t leave your dog alone in a car.”

The temperature inside a car in full sunlight can quickly rise to double the temperature outside the car. Signs that dogs are overheating can include faster and heavier panting, with them being more active with barking or whining.  They might produce more saliva that normal, have extreme panting and dark coloured gums.  A dogs eyes may become glassy and it may appear unconscious.

Detecting overheating early and treating it promptly is essential to dogs recovering successfully.  Dogs should be taken to a cool shaded place, given water to drink, and sprayed with cool water.  Dogs can also be cooled down by blowing cool air from a fan over them.  Pet owners should get advice from a vet immediately if the dog does not respond promptly.

The Truth: Tree and plant health is an absolute priority in Defra and our response to tree diseases has been put on the same footing as our response to animal diseases. When chalara was identified in our trees and woodland the Secretary of State Owen Paterson appointed a senior civil servant with extensive experience to ensure a swift and effective response. The team brought in people from across disciplines and organisations, including the Chief Plant Health Officer and other plant health experts from the Forestry Commission and Fera.

The resulting action included conducting an urgent survey of ash trees across the whole of the UK that was unprecedented in our history, and organising a summit of experts with an interest in tree health to help develop the Chalara Control Plan. The scale of our response was reflected in the COBRA meetings chaired by the Secretary of State. It is also evident in the Plant Health Task Force convened by Defra’s Chief Scientific Adviser and chaired by Professor Chris Gilligan, which will make radical recommendations on how we should handle plant diseases.

These are not characteristics of a chaotic response, but of a Government that acted quickly to get a grip of the unprecedented threat to our woodlands.

Finally Pam Warhurst was not removed, as the Times suggests.  Her term as Chair of the Forestry Commission came to an end and Mr Paterson has paid tribute to her robust and resolute leadership over the last three years."

It builds on TB biosecurity advice already available to cattle farmers.

The information and advice in the video is drawn from behavioural and observational studies carried out by researchers at the Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera), who provide impartial, independent advice to Government and who have been involved in the study of badgers and bovine TB since the 1970s.

Agriculture Minister Jim Paice said:

“Good wildlife biosecurity will help to reduce the risk of cattle getting TB, and this video will help ensure famers have the most up-to-date advice to take simple and effective steps.

“TB is a devastating disease and good biosecurity is part of the comprehensive package of measures we need to get the disease under control and start to eradicate it.”

The training video is jointly funded by Defra, the National Farmers Union (NFU), the Welsh Government and the National Animal Disease Information Service (NADIS).

John Griffiths, Welsh Government Minister for Environment and Sustainable Development, said:

“Biosecurity is an important aspect of our comprehensive approach to tackling bovine TB. I hope this film will be a useful tool for farmers and provide them with some practical tips for ways they can improve biosecurity on their farms.”

NFU President Peter Kendall said:

“Improving on-farm biosecurity and introducing measures to keep badgers out of farm buildings and feed stores can play a part in reducing the TB risks posed to cattle herds.

“This video shows the industry is working hard to try all measures which could help to limit the spread and impact of this terrible disease.”

The video forms part of the wider TB eradication programme and implements a recommendation made by the Bovine TB Eradication Group for England in their 2009 Progress Report that highlighted the need to provide TB affected farmers with more effective and better focused support and advice.

It will be used by Defra, the Welsh Government, the NFU, the South West TB Farm Advisory Service (SWTBFAS) and National Animal Disease Information Service at training events across the country, and is also available to download through the Defra YouTube account:http://uk.youtube.com/user/defrauk.

The DVD is presented by Dr Jo Judge, a wildlife biologist at the Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera), which carries out research into wildlife ecology and management, specialising in the effective and sustainable control of wildlife diseases. The DVD advice on biosecurity and badger exclusion measures is the result of a three year Fera project investigating the use of farm buildings by badgers.

These include:

NICEwill develop better evidence on what high-quality care looks like with the aim of improving the quality of social care.

This initial list was based on NICE consultation with the care and support sector on joint NHS/social care standards as well as priority areas for action emerging from theCare and Support __White Paper.

Earl Howe, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for qualitysaid:

“The Care and Support White Paper set out our plans to drive up the quality of care.

NICE’s new quality standards on social care will be a key driver of this. They will help define what good care and support looks like for commissioners and care providers as well as people using services.”

NICE expects that standards in autism and mental well-being of older people in residential care quality standards will be published in 2013/14 with other quality standards published later.

The Department will soon consult with the care and support sector, people using care and support, and their families and carers, on what a full set of NICE quality standards and guidance should include to improve the quality of social care. Care providers will be able to use these as tools to help improve their services.

NICE is currently piloting two joint NHS/social care Quality Standards, covering the care of people with dementia and the health and well-being of looked after children and young people. Following a consultation process, NICE is aiming to publish these final Quality Standards in April 2013."

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/bump-book-to-help-pregnant-mums-keep-healthy,News story,‘Bump book’ to help pregnant mums keep healthy,Free booklet for all pregnant mums to help them keep healthy throughout pregnancy.,Department of Health and Social Care and Dr Daniel Poulter,15 December 2012,"Start4Life, the sister brand toChange4Life, has today launched a free booklet for all pregnant mums to help them keep healthy throughout pregnancy and beyond.

The aim is to get mums-to-be to share information about their health and the steps they are taking to give their babies the best possible start in life, both online and offline.

Health Minister Dr Dan Poultersaid:

“Staying healthy in pregnancy is vital to give babies the best possible start in life. We want to do everything we can to reach out to pregnant women and help them live the healthiest lifestyles they can.

“These new materials from Start4Life simplify the information out there and provide clear advice on the importance of a healthy pregnancy.

“The sheer volume of information available to pregnant women - on Facebook and elsewhere - can make it hard to find the best advice. Start4Life will help them to take simple steps to stay healthy for themselves and their baby.”

The booklets have been developed in response to findings from a joint survey from parenting siteNetmumsand the department’s Start4Life campaign, which showed a growing trend around how mums-to-be are sharing their pregnancies online.

While the trend for sharing pregnancy information online is growing, 68% of those surveyed felt that online, mothers-to-be were more likely to try to show a ‘perfect’ pregnancy than a realistic one. Some respondents suggested this could increase the sense of failure for anyone who did not have the ‘perfect’ pregnancy.

*The newStart4Life bookletsare available to all pregnant women through their GPs and midwives and contain helpful tips and advice, healthy recipes, myth busters and exercise suggestions, along with space for mothers-to-be to enter their thoughts and any questions they may have around their pregnancy. There is also space to include their midwife’s name and number, their due date and a frame to place their baby’s first scan.

Through effective intelligence-led enforcement, it targets key criminals engaged in serious and organised crime.

Announcing the funding, Richard Benyon said:

Wildlife crime is a very serious issue with organised gangs using the proceeds from illegally traded items like rhino horn to fuel other illegal activities. It’s right that a specialist unit supports the police in bringing these people to trial. The funding for another year will mean the unit can continue to bring criminals to justice and tackle the illegal wildlife trade both at home and abroad.

The Wildlife Crime Unit has been instrumental in the UK in combating the illegal trade in rhino horn, which now has a blackmarket value in Asia as high as gold.

During 2012 theNWCU:

Defra funds £136,000 of theNWCUbudget; it is additionally funded by the Home Office, who will match Defra funding with a further £136,000.

Notes

TheNWCUis a strategic police unit, based in Livingston in Scotland, which collates intelligence and enforcement activity about wildlife crime across all UK police forces. Recently it has run major operations concerning badger-baiting, the smuggling of reptiles and amphibians, and the persecution of raptors."

Once flu is spreading widely, apart from vaccination, hygiene is the only method that can help prevent spread.

Studies have shown that respiratory infections are reduced in groups who practice good hand and respiratory hygiene measures. This campaign is also likely to have a positive effect on other diseases such as norovirus.

Patients most at risk from flu, including adults and children with chronic long-term conditions such as asthma, neurological conditions or heart, lung, kidney or liver disease, and the over 65s and pregnant women, who have not yet had their vaccine should contact their GP as soon as possible.

The latest campaign consists of national press, radio and video-on-demand advertising and will run for approximately 3 weeks.

Today’s measures are on top of the wider ranging financial package provided by the UK government, backed by £160 billion, to protect jobs, incomes and business throughout and beyond this pandemic.

The government is clear that where businesses can pay their rent, they should do so, as this support is aimed to those businesses struggling the most during the pandemic.

This move will help those businesses most in need of additional support to remain in their premises without the threat of eviction for the rest of this year, giving them the chance to focus on rebuilding their business over the autumn and Christmas period.

Secretary of State for Housing Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:

I am announcing today that we are extending support to protect those businesses that are unable to pay their rent from eviction to the end of the year. This will stop businesses going under and protect jobs over the coming months.

This government is committed to supporting businesses and our high streets at this difficult time, and this extension of support will help businesses recover from the impacts of the pandemic and plan for the future.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma said:

During this particularly challenging time for businesses, it is crucial that both landlords and tenants have the clarity and reassurance they need to build back better from the pandemic.

Extending the temporary measures we put in place earlier this year to protect businesses from the threat of eviction will give them some much-needed breathing space at a critical moment in the UK’s economic recovery.

This extension will protect businesses that are struggling to pay their rent due to the impact of COVID-19 from being evicted and help the thousands of people working in these sectors feel more secure about their jobs.

The government will also extend the restriction on landlords using Commercial Rents Arrears Recovery to enforce unpaid rent on commercial leases, until the end of the year.

The guidance is clear both landlords and tenants should continue to work together to agree rent payment options if businesses are struggling. In June, the government published aCode of Practiceto support these discussions.

The Code of Practice was produced alongside leading businesses and trade associations to help guide and encourage all parties to work together to protect viable businesses and ensure a swift recovery.

Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Daviessaid:

“I am delighted to have confirmation of my revalidation from the GMC.

“Being revalidated was an incredibly useful experience, and allowed me to reflect on my own practice and approach. All feedback is useful to doctors - and for many it is about improving their already high standards.

“This is the biggest change to medical regulation in over a hundred years, but must importantly the process provides huge reassurance to patients and the public.”

Revalidation will help doctors keep up to the standard expected of them by ensuring they stay up-to-date with the latest techniques, technologies and research. It will also require a doctor to tackle any concerns about skills such as communication and maintaining trust with patients.

Up to 20 communities will receive grants for local flood risk management schemes. Defra will evaluate the success of each scheme to identify the best ways to improve resilience to flooding in communities across the country.

Environment Minister Richard Benyon said:

“Flooding causes devastating damage to people’s homes and possessions and can leave whole communities living in fear of more bad weather.  This scheme will give these communities the chance to design and implement their own projects to protect their homes and businesses from future flooding.

“More is being spent by Government and our partners on flood risk management in this four year spending period than any other.  We have introduced a new funding model that gives local people more choice over flood protection and allows more schemes to go ahead. We now expect to exceed our goal to protect a further 145,000 homes and businesses by 2015.”

Defra is inviting local authorities across England to come forward with proposals to improve their communities’ resilience to flooding.  Funding for the successful applicants will begin in March 2013.

The Flood Resilience Community Pathfinder is a pilot scheme that will be run over two years.

Earlier this week, the Government announced £120 million in new funding to speed up the delivery of flood defences that could protect up to 60,000 homes and deliver up to £1 billion of economic benefits.

£60 million of the funding will be targeted at areas where flood defences can unlock new areas for development and growth, helping our country compete and thrive in the global race. Investment will be focused on areas where it will have the greatest economic impact. A further £60 million will help speed up the delivery of up to 50 flood defence schemes already in train and prioritised by the Environment Agency.

This additional funding comes on top of over £2 billion already set aside to tackle flood and coastal erosion risks over the course of the Spending Review.

The additional investment in flood defences, combined with the new money brought in through the Government’s successful partnership funding scheme means over the current spending review, funding will be higher than ever before on protecting people from flooding.

Note to editors:

For more information visitCommunity Pathfinder scheme.**

The Flood Resilience Community Pathfinder scheme is designed to follow on from Defra’s scheme to install Property Level Protection between 2009 and 2011. The scheme provided flood protection to more than 1,000 vulnerable homes and made them more resilient.  Projects under the new Pathfinder are likely to combine a number of different elements which show how they have reduced the risk of flooding or improved resilience.

Funding criteria for the Autumn Statement, growth through flood alleviation fund

The Environment Agency will work with Regional Flood & Coastal Committees, local authorities and other partners to identify a list of flood and coastal risk management schemes that would lead to a measurable impact on economic growth, such as by creating new jobs, boosting inward investment, and unlocking the potential for regeneration and appropriate re-development.  Expected impacts will need to have evidence provided by project sponsors.

Mr Heath also launched a separate scheme allowing English dairy farmers to apply for £5 million-worth of grants to develop new market opportunities through co-operation.

Defra is consulting on new rules allowing English dairy farmers to come together and form producer organisations to sell their combined milk to processing companies rather than negotiate as individuals.

It will mean that alongside the new industry code of practice, producers could have more influence over contractual terms, conditions and prices.

Mr Heath said:

“England’s dairy industry is world-leading yet still has so much potential to expand, and I’m convinced that better industry collaboration is the key.

“We’ve already got the industry code of practice, and negotiating as groups rather than individuals will give dairy farmers an even louder voice to get their just rewards from the marketplace.

“Our £5 million dairy fund will also allow producers to develop other means of cooperation and grab business opportunities with both hands.”

The two schemes follow a critical year for the industry in which the Government helped to secure an industry agreement on a voluntary code of practice on contracts between farmers and processors.

The plans on producer organisations are part of asix-week consultationon how to implement the European Union’s Dairy Package in England. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will hold their own consultations.

Currently farmers negotiate with processors as individuals, but under the new plans, producer organisations, which are already widespread in other European countries, could cover up to a third of UK production and would negotiate on behalf of members.

The UK currently imports £1.2 billion more dairy produce than it exports, and there is huge potential for growth in domestic and export markets.

To help business growth, the £5 million dairy fund, offered through the Rural Development Programme for England, will allow farmers to apply for£25,000 minimum grantsto support groups of dairy farmers.

These could cover costs to establish new cooperation structures, such as producer groups and cooperatives, and invest in technology to take advantage of new market opportunities.

David Heath will make today’s announcement on a Rural Roadshow to the Isle of Wight.  He will visit the Isle of Wight Dairy Group, which has led the way in the industry following funding from Defra’s Rural Development Programme for England to set up an innovative farm cooperative.

The cooperative, which is the first of its kind in the country, brings together 17 of the island’s dairy farmers to produce and market Isle of Wight branded milk to around 30 retailers across the Isle of Wight, including supermarkets and local shops.

The Rural Roadshows allow Defra ministers to hear firsthand about rural issues from communities and businesses, learning about successes and challenges and discovering what help is needed in order to support rural growth and jobs.

The direct access to ministers will help ensure that rural England has a strong voice at the heart of Government."

From the construction of the Olympic Park to the long-term legacy plans, 75 pence in every pound invested has been focused on longer-term benefits.

There have been immediate benefits, from the regeneration of East London, to the prospects of thousands of businesses across the country, with a new study showing that the positive economic impact of London 2012 could reach between £13 and £16.5bn. But hosting the Games has always been about showing how British ingenuity and commitment to making the world “greener” could deliver both economic and social benefits.

The evidence from the construction of the Olympic site clearly shows that taking a sustainable approach can actually save money, rather than costing a project more, as is usually assumed. Major businesses involved in creating the Games are already applying these sustainability lessons to their next projects, not out of some altruism but because there are real bottom line benefits for business.

Defra has also been working with a number of organisations to use the Games to “Inspire Sustainable Living”. This has generated a number of projects which have successfully encouraged individuals and local communities to adopt greener behaviours, such as recycling more, reducing water and energy use, and walking and cycling more on new accessible routes.

Wessex Water’s sewage treatment works in Avonmouth could create jobs and new business opportunities and is the first such facility in the area.  Built and operated by Wessex Water subsidiary GENeco, the new anaerobic digestion plant can annually turn 40,000 tonnes of food waste into a renewable energy supply equivalent to serving 3,000 homes.  It also produces a nutrient-rich organic fertiliser to help local farmers reduce their costs and reliance on non-organic chemical fertilisers.

Speaking at the official opening, David Heath said:

“We see here the ideal balance between good business sense and environmental protection.  A growth investment which helps business reduce its costs and build new commercial and job-creating opportunities, while resolving an environmental problem.  Money has gone into creating new jobs and an economic growth opportunity rather than paying the costs of disposing of Bristol’s food waste.

“The Government is actively supporting this sector, and in the past year alone the UK has doubled the amount of food waste converted into renewable energy.  Growth in this sector not only provides jobs in construction and waste industries, but helps British companies develop export opportunities.”

During his visit to the plant, Mr Heath found out how Wessex Water had invested in GENeco to solve a serious business problem caused by the growing costs of both electricity and of waste disposal.  Now they have turned a problem into a resource, which has cut their business’s electricity costs and is helping them develop new business opportunities which will create jobs locally and across the UK.

Mr Heath added:

“The GENeco plant is also unique by being the first food waste anaerobic plant in Britain to be built in a sewage treatment works.  Water companies can provide a significant boost to the expansion of waste food anaerobic digestion in this country by using their expertise from treating sewage.

“This could potentially create thousands of new jobs and generate significant amounts of renewable energy, while solving a major environmental issue in the disposal of waste food.”

Mr Heath was shown around the new plant by GENeco General Manager Mohammed Saddiq, who commented:

“The opening of the food waste plant builds on the success and experience of using anaerobic digestion to treat sewage sludge and generate power.

“Through this investment we will produce significantly more renewable energy, while also providing a sustainable solution for dealing with food waste which traditionally goes to landfill.

“Dealing with food waste in the this way is better for the environment as it prevents greenhouse gases, by capturing methane which can be used to produce power.”

Wessex Water said it was building anaerobic digestion plants at other sites in its region due to the environmental benefits they offered and because they helped tackle the problem of growing electricity and waste disposal costs.

You can sign up to get alerts when any new NHS data or flu updates are published.

Winterwatch, originally launched in 2010, is part of a wider suite of work by the Department, such as theCold Weather Plan,Keep Warm Keep Well, and theWarm Homes Healthy People Fund, that will help protect people and keep them informed about the effects of severe winter weather.

Cold weather increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes, lung illnesses, flu and other diseases. People also slip and fall in the snow or ice causing serious injuries.

Approximately 27,000 more people die each year in England over the winter months when compared with other times of the year. This is often referred to as ‘excess winter deaths’ or ‘excess winter mortality’. Very severe weather can substantially add to this death toll.You can view the data on the Office for National Statistics website.

Speaking at the National Farmers Union (NFU) annual conference, Mr Paterson announced thatauthorisation lettershave been issued by Natural England confirming the culls can proceed this summer.

Mr Paterson also announced a reserve pilot will also be prepared in Dorset in the event that unforeseen circumstances prevent one of the cull areas from being used. This is part of the ongoing planning to ensure there are no delays to the cull proceeding this year.

Owen Paterson, Environment Secretary, said:

Bovine TB is spreading at an alarming rate and causing real devastation to our beef and dairy industry. The authorisation letters issued today confirming culling can proceed this summer in West Gloucestershire and West Somerset is an important step towards taking the action we need to tackle the spread of this disease in wildlife.

I am determined that there are no further delays this year. That is why we have taken the sensible step with the farming industry to elect a reserve area that can be called upon should anything happen to prevent culling in Somerset or Gloucestershire.

These pilot culls are just one part of our approach to control and eradicate this dreadful disease. We are using everything at our disposal to get to grips with TB including new tougher controls on moving cattle, increased herd testing and working to get effective vaccines ready as soon as possible.

The experience of countries such as the Republic of Ireland, the United States, Australia and New Zealand shows that TB in cattle cannot be controlled without also tackling the disease in the surrounding wildlife.  In New Zealand, the number of infected cattle and deer herds has been reduced from 1,700 in the mid 1990s to fewer than 100 in 2011. This is as a result of rigorous bio-security measures, strict cattle movement controls and proactive wildlife management.

The authorisation letters issued by Natural England mean that culling will be able to proceed at any point from 1 June. The pilot culls will last for 6 weeks and will be repeated annually for four years.

The pilots are being carried out to test the chosen method of culling through free shooting. The pilots will be independently assessed to check the method is both effective in removing enough badgers and humane.

The reserve pilot in Dorset will be prepared in the same way as the two licensed areas so that it is ready to proceed if necessary in the summer."

He explains there are two simple principles at the heart of the Act - that patients should share in every decision about their care and those responsible for patient care should have the ‘freedom and power to lead an NHS that delivers continually improving care’.

In a letter to clinical commissioning group leaders, he reassured them:

’ … the breadth and scope of competition in the NHS is something you will determine, in the interests of your patients. It will not be imposed upon you from Whitehall.’

He emphasised to chief executives of NHS foundation trusts and NHS trusts that:

‘The Government’s ambition is to ensure all providers of NHS-funded care … are genuinely free from political interference to focus on how best to treat their patients … to design their services … and to continuously improve the quality of their services.’

And when writing to the chief executives of local authorities, Mr Lansley highlighted that:

‘The Health and Social Care Act will help ensure you are no longer bystanders in the decisions that affect your local communities.’

The Department of Health, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and the Health and Safety Executive have issued annual advice for a number of years that pregnant women who come into close contact with sheep during lambing may risk their own health, and that of their unborn child, from infections that can occur in some ewes.

Although the number of human pregnancies affected by contact with an infected animal is extremely small, it is important that pregnant women are aware of the potential risks and take appropriate precautions.

It is also important to note that these risks are not only confined to the spring (when the majority of lambs are born), nor are the risks only associated with sheep: cows and goats that have recently given birth can also carry similar infections.

To avoid the possible risk of infection, pregnant women are advised that they should:

Pregnant women should seek medical advice if they experience fever or influenza-like symptoms, or if concerned that they could have acquired infection from a farm environment.

Farmers have a responsibility to minimise the risks to pregnant women, including members of their family, the public and professional staff visiting farms.

Notes

Farmers should consult their veterinary surgeon about suitable vaccination programmes and any other disease control measures in sheep, cattle and goats.

The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations 2002require employers and the self employed to assess risks to health from harmful substances, including micro-organisms, and to take steps to prevent or control those risks, andThe Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999require employers and the self employed to further assess any risks which affect pregnant women.

Children aged 5 to 11, who are in a clinical risk group or who are a household contact of someone (of any age) who is immunosuppressed, should be offered a primary course of vaccination.

Primary course vaccination for these children should be with 2 10-microgram doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (a third of the adult dose), with an interval of 8 weeks between the first and second doses.

Further advice regarding COVID-19 vaccination for other 5 to 11 year olds will be issued in due course following consideration of additional data relevant to this age group, and on the Omicron variant more broadly.

Separately, in response to the threat from the Omicron variant, theJCVIhas advised that booster vaccinations should be offered to persons aged:

16 to 17 years

12 to 15 who are in a clinical risk group or who are a household contact of someone (of any age) who is immunosuppressed

12 to 15 years who are severely immunocompromised and who have had a third primary dose

The booster vaccination for these age groups should be with 30 micrograms of the PfizerBioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, given no sooner than 3 months after completion of the primary course.

Professor Wei Shen Lim, Chair, COVID-19 immunisation,JCVI, said:

The majority of children aged 5 to 11 are at very low risk of serious illness due to COVID-19. However, some 5 to 11 year olds have underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk, and we advise these children to be vaccinated in the first instance.

For children and young people who have completed a primary course of vaccination, a booster dose will provide added protection against the Omicron variant."

Northern Bank’s head of trade finance Ruth Graham said: “We are increasingly seeing customers - particularly in construction and related sectors - seeking out new export markets in efforts to maintain and grow their business amid ongoing challenging economic times. With this comes increasing customer demand for trade finance-related bond and guarantee products to support their export activity, often required by buyers in foreign jurisdictions before signing a contract.

“UK Export Finance’s bond support scheme effectively shares the risk between the bank and the UK Government, so we can provide greater levels of export support to both new and existing customers.”

Northern Bank’s senior corporate banking manager said: “Export has been identified as one of the essential components of sustainable economic recovery and long-term growth, and Northern Bank is strongly committed to supporting this strategy by making it more straightforward for aspiring and experienced exporters achieve their full potential in the coming months and years.

“Our partnership with UK Export Finance is just one example of this commitment and we look forward to welcoming more exporting customers in the near future as we continue to open doors to new markets for businesses in Northern Ireland.”

UK Export Finance chief executive Patrick Crawford welcomed Northern Bank’s participation in the scheme. He said: “This is good news for exporters in Northern Ireland. Northern Bank’s support for the Scheme is a clear demonstration of its appetite for export business and its strong commitment to supporting exporters in Northern Ireland.”"

All four parts of the UK have signed off an aligned approach allowing up to three households to form a ‘Christmas bubble’ from December 23 to 27.

Individuals will also be able to travel between tiers and across the whole of the UK without restriction within the five-day period, for the purposes of meeting with their bubble. Those travelling to and from Northern Ireland will be permitted to travel an additional day either side.

The approach was agreed by Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, and the First Ministers of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales and the deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland during a COBR meeting he chaired this afternoon.

Speaking following the meeting, Mr Gove said:

The UK-wide agreement reached today will offer hope for families and friends who have made many sacrifices over this difficult year.

We know that the Christmas period this year will not be normal, but following constructive discussions between the UK Government and the Devolved Administrations, families and friends will now have the option to meet up in a limited and cautious way across the UK should they wish.

In coming to this agreement, we have listened to scientific and clinical advice on how best to minimise the risk and reach a balanced and workable set of rules that we hope will allow people to spend time together at this important time of year.

Each administration will clarify their own rules on support bubbles and extended households in due course. In England, support bubbles will continue to be counted as one household.

Christmas bubbles will be able to gather in private homes, attend places of worship together and meet in outdoor public places. Beyond this, people should continue to follow all other local restrictions in the area. Guidance is being published on Gov.uk.

As part of the agreement, each administration will be reminding households that they should remain alert to the risks still posed by the virus and consider how, where possible, they can celebrate and support more isolated friends and loved ones through alternative approaches such as video calls and meeting outdoors.

When following these new rules, people are reminded to continue to take personal responsibility to limit the spread of the virus and protect loved ones, particularly if they are vulnerable. Forming a bubble for those who are vulnerable or clinically extremely vulnerable carries additional risks.

The four parts of the UK will work together to communicate these new measures across the country and ensure that communities are aware of any variations in approaches.

Details of the new measures can be found in thejoint statement, agreed today."

Russia is the world’s largest consumer market for wallpaper, 3 times larger than the UK market.

ECGDhas issued 2 export insurance policies to Blackburn-basedGraham & Brown. These were tailored to Graham & Brown’s pattern of business and will enable the company to increase its overseas sales to Russia significantly. These are the first policies issued sinceECGDexpanded the type of business that it covers under its credit insurance policy in line with the announcement in the government white paperTrade and Investment for Growth.

Andrew Graham, chief executive of Graham & Brown, said:

Russia is the biggest market for wallpaper in the world, but our growth was being limited by insufficient availability of export credit insurance from private markets. Our biggest competitors from Germany have been able to access credit insurance from a government-backed scheme, making it less risky and therefore easier for them to develop business in this most important market.ECGDhas worked closely with our brokers, Atlas, to help provide comparable cover. We will continue to work withECGDand Atlas to obtain further insurance for Russia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, so we can develop our export business further.

Atlas Risk CEO Barry Skinner said:

This was a good example of strong team-work betweenECGD, an exporter and its broker to support a great British exporter. Now thatECGDis able to offer cover to companies like Graham & Brown, I hope that many more British companies will see the value of credit insurance in giving them confidence to export and to take on new markets.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-sets-out-plan-for-living-with-covid,News story,Prime Minister sets out plan for living with COVID,The Prime Minister sets out the Government’s plans to live with and manage the virus.,"Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson",21 February 2022,"Vaccines will remain the first line of defence against Covid-19 as the Prime Minister sets out theGovernment’s plansto live with and manage the virus.

The UK was the first country in the world to authorise the use of the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines, the first European country to vaccinate 50% of its population and has delivered the fastest booster programme in Europe.

Over 31 million boosters have been administered across England and almost 38 million UK wide helping break the link between infections and hospitalisations. In England, the number of cases, hospitalisations and deaths continue to decline and are far below the levels of previous waves, with boosters offering strong protection against severe illness and hospitalisation.

Thanks to our hugely successful vaccination programme, the immunity built up in the population and our new antiviral and therapeutics tools, the UK is in the strongest possible position to learn how to live with Covid and end government regulation.

To save lives and protect the NHS, unprecedented measures were taken on a global scale that interfered with people’s lives and livelihoods. Billions of pounds were spent on supporting a locked down economy as the public stayed at home.

The Prime Minister has been clear that restrictions would not stay in place a day longer than necessary. The British public have made extraordinary sacrifices during the 2020 lockdowns, the Roadmap, and recent Plan B measures in response to the Omicron variant.

The Plan, published today, sets out how vaccines and other pharmaceutical interventions will continue to form our first line of defence. Today the Government has accepted the JCVI recommendation to offer an additional booster to all adults aged over 75, all residents in care homes for older adults, and all over 12s who are immunosuppressed.

An autumn annual booster programme is under consideration, subject to further advice. Further detail on deployment on the spring booster programme will be set out in due course. The Government will continue to be guided by the JCVI on future vaccine programmes.

The plan covers four main pillars:

The public are encouraged to continue to follow public health advice, as with all infectious diseases such as the flu, to minimise the chance of catching Covid and help protect family and friends. This includes by letting fresh air in when meeting indoors, wearing a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where you come into contact with people you don’t normally meet, and washing your hands.

The Prime Minister has today confirmed domestic legal restrictions will end on 24 February as we begin to treat Covid as other infectious diseases such as flu. This means:

Our testing programme has been a crucial part of our response to the virus. Over 2 billion lateral flow tests have been provided across the UK since 2020 ensuring people could stay safe and meet family and friends knowing they were free of the virus.

As set out in the Autumn and Winter Plan, universal free provision of tests will end as our response to the virus changes. From the start of April, the government will end free symptomatic and asymptomatic testing for the general public. Limited symptomatic testing will be available for a small number of at-risk groups and we will set out further details on which groups will be eligible shortly. Free symptomatic testing will also remain available to social care staff. We are working with retailers to ensure that everyone who wants to can buy a test.

The Test & Trace programme cost £15.7 billion in 2021/22. With Omicron now the dominant variant and less severe, levels of high immunity across the country and a range of strategies in place including vaccines, treatments, and public health knowledge, the value for taxpayers’ money is now less clear.

The agreement is an understanding that facilitates the sharing of experience on risk assessment and wider export credit policies and practices. It also provides for how the UK and Russia can work together to support projects in third countries that involve the supply of goods from both countries.

The agreement comes at a time of growing trading opportunities between the 2 countries. On the day of the agreement, Business Secretary Vince Cable called for British firms to pursue new exporting opportunities in Russia, as he hosted a business summit with Russia’s First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said:

“Britain’s trade with Russia is rapidly expanding and the opportunities will only continue to grow as its economy opens up further to trade and investment. Important steps like Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation earlier this year are making it easier for UK firms to do business there. We look forward to working closely with Russia to further develop new opportunities, delivering real economic results for both countries.”

Russia is now the UK’s 14th biggest export market and is one of the fastest growing, with British exports having grown 39% in 2011 to £4.78 billion. Demand for UK Export Finance support for exports to Russia has followed this trend, with Russia the most popular market for UK Export Finance support in 2011 to 2012."

ECGDprovided a guarantee to ANZ National Bank in support of a loan to Swift Transport. The buses are now being shipped in chassis form from the UK to New Zealand where they will be bodied by Kiwi Bus Builders, using kits supplied fromADL’s Falkirk factory. Swift Transport will then lease the vehicles to its subsidiary NZ Bus.

The vehicles we are providing are fuel efficient, highly manoeuvrable midi buses that have been a huge success in the UK and other territories. We have an opportunity here to change the transport landscape in Auckland and across New Zealand. Our new build partnership with Kiwi Bus may also provide the gateway to Australia.

“It is clear that the government, throughECGDand other departments is prepared to put its money where its mouth is when it comes to helping UK companies access new export markets. This sort of initiative provides a win-win situation for everyone. It supports jobs at our manufacturing operations in the UK, provides the platform for new build partnerships in overseas territories and puts British products in the shop window of the world. All of that could not have happened without the support ofECGDwhich, thankfully, also recognised the need for urgency and minimum bureaucracy.”

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/press-briefing-morning-29-january-2013,Press release,Press briefing - morning 29 January 2013,"The Prime Minister's Spokesperson (PMS) answered questions on Mali, boundary changes and Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street",29 January 2013,"ThePMSinformed the Lobby that the PM is working from Downing Street today. In other government business, it was announced that Liz Truss is publishing proposals on childcare and Justine Greening will be appearing in front of the International Development Committee on aid to Pakistan.

ThePMSprovided Lobby with an update on the UK response to the situation in Mali. Three strands to the UK’s efforts were identified:

First: UK assistance to the French Military in Mali. ThePMSemphasised that the Prime Minister had been very clear when speaking in Parliament that there would not be a combat role for UK troops - and this position remained entirely unchanged.

Logistical and intelligence support to the French to-date has consisted of the initial use of two C-17’s, the loan of one these aircraft has now been extended for a further three months. In addition, we have provided the French with the use of a RAF surveillance aircraft, Sentinel, which was deployed at the end of last week.

ThePMSconfirmed that discussions with the French government have been continuing, including through Sir Kim Darroch’s meeting in Paris yesterday. The possible use of a strategic roll-on/roll-off ferry to move vehicles and equipment from France has been discussed. Following confirmation from the French that they would welcome assistance with this sealift capability, we are now exploring that option further with them.

A combined joint logistics headquarters on the ground in Mali was considered as an option during dialogue with the French. At this stage, the French have been very clear that they do not envisage the need to deploy that capability and we are not progressing that at the moment. ThePMSstated that the decision, along with all other options would continue to be kept under review in the normal way, but declined to engage in speculation.

ThePMSalso set out that the government is prepared to consider requests from allies to operate their air-to-air refuelling aircraft out of the UK in support of the military intervention in Mali.

The second strand of the UK response identified by thePMSwas the EU training mission in Mali. ThePMSconfirmed that a force generation conference is taking place in Brussels today as part of the ongoing work to plan for the training mission. Comprising of defence attaches from each of the 27 EU members states, the meeting will discuss the composition of the training mission and individual member state contributions.

The UK has said that we are prepared to contribute up to 40 personnel, in line with the PM’s statement to the House last week. ThePMSemphasised that the exact composition of the training force is still being discussed, and the size and role of the British contribution would be determined by the force generation conference. Depending upon contributions other member states are willing or able to make, it could be lower than 40.

ThePMSidentified the third strand as training other regional militaries through the African Union and AFISMA (African-Led International Support Mission in Mali).

AFISMA is an operation in support of the Malian government, and thePMSexplained that it was the Government’s view that, using Somalia as a frame of reference, it was right that regional forces led operations.

ThePMSdescribed the UK’s role in supporting AFISMA as being part of international political and economic efforts to promote stability in the region. AFISMA would enhance the capabilities of regional forces to deal with regional security challenges, such as terrorist havens.

ThePMSinformed Lobby that the UK’s role in this effort is also subject to ongoing discussions, with the African Union meeting today in Addis Ababa. The current offer made by the Government is for up to 200 British military personnel to provide training to troops from Anglophone West African countries, as part of the AFISMA mission. In addition, the UK is offering £5m for two UN trust funds that are directed to supporting the work of AFISMA in the region.

Summarising the UK involvement, thePMSsaid that the ‘up to 40’ personnel for the EU training mission and the ‘up to 200’ in support of the wider regional training of African Union forces are the main offers of contributions.

ThePMSconfirmed that there would also be UK personnel deployed with the Sentinel and the C-17. Further questions on operational details were referred to MoD, but thePMS’ understanding was that there can be around 70 personnel deployed with the Sentinel and about 20 personnel with the C-17.

ThePMSdeclined to answer questions on operational deployments and rules of engagements, and referred Lobby to MoD.

Asked about the PM’s views on the issue of boundary changes, thePMSreplied that these are well set out but that the PM thinks it is important that it is put before Parliament. Pressed on whether the PM had discussed the issue with the leaders of other political parties, thePMSsaid political parties are involved in regular contact on a wide range of issues. Further questions were referred to political advisors.

Asked for the PM’s view on the abdication of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, thePMSsaid it is a matter for Queen Beatrix and the Dutch Royal Family.

In response to questions about Libor, thePMSsaid that this was a matter for regulators.

ThePMSsaid that the government is disappointed that the Court of Appeal has today found against the Home Office in three cases regarding disclosure of Criminal Records. Further questions were referred to the Home Office.

ThePMSsaid he was not aware of any government proposals on detailing the ethnic mix of staff as part of hiring policies, but referred Lobby to BIS."

Representatives from Somaliland, Mogadishu, Puntland, the minority clans in South Central Somalia and diaspora from Kenyan and Tanzania, as well as representatives from the London Somali Youth Forum and the Council of Somali Organisations attended the meeting on Monday.

The Prime Minister heard how the Government can best support the Somali UK diasporas to contribute to the support needed on the ground and how we can all work together to secure a long term settlement in the Horn of Africa.

He assured the round table that the government was committed to maintaining close cooperation with the Somali diaspora beyond Thursday.

Speaking after the meeting the Prime Minister said:

As we all agreed at the round table, the whole of the world needs to get behind Somalia to turn it into a safer and more prosperous place.

The London Somali Conference is about recognising the huge amount of effort going on in Somalia to help rebuild the country and what the world needs to do is help that take place and to grow. The Conference is an opportunity to show that we fully support the efforts of the Somali people themselves to build a stronger, safer, more prosperous country. In particular how we forge a new momentum in working together to tackle piracy, terrorism, conflict, poverty and famine.

For two decades the problems in Somalia have been dismissed as simply too difficult and too remote to deal with. That fatalism has failed Somalia. And it’s failed Britain too. Yes, it’s an incredibly difficult situation but I have great expectations and great hopes for what I think we can achieve in lots of different areas and I’m convinced that the international community can help create a breakthrough. In the end, it’s about giving everyone in Somalia, particularly young people, some hope of a job and a voice and a future.”

Baroness Warsi - who was also in attendance - said:

At a time when Britain and the world are getting behind the people of Somalia to build a stable future it is important that the voice of the British Somali diaspora community is heard. Not only are they one of the largest diaspora communities outside of Africa but they’re also huge contributors through remittance, travel between the UK and Somalia, trade and investment and ongoing community and humanitarian work.

The British Somali community are a wide and diverse community, and it’s important that we listen to what they have to say. The diaspora roundtable has kick-started an important week of discussions on Somalia.

International Development Minister Stephen O’Brien also met with Somali community groups in Bristol, where he outlined the UK’s support for Somalia during the recent famine and set out the aims of Thursday’s conference.

The Government is focussed on practical measures in seven key areas to help make Somalia and the region more stable and secure:

At least 15% of the Somali population (10 million) live outside its borders.

The UK is home to one of the largest communities (200,000) outside East Africa mostly based in London, Birmingham, Leicester, Manchester, Leeds and Bristol.

Many of the Ministers in the Transitional Federal Government come from the diaspora, including from the UK.

Estimated that the diaspora worldwide remits anything from $1.3-$2 billion a year back to Somalia, of which up to $130-200 million goes to humanitarian and development assistance."

The closing date for this consultation has been extended to Friday 31 August 2012.

Some organisations have expressed real interest in the consultation while stating their need for additional time to undertake discussion meetings with their members before submitting a formal response. By extending the deadline for this secondary consultation, the aim is to ensure that everyone who wishes to respond will have sufficient time to do so.

The Department of Health is consulting further on these detailed proposals to implement the Government’s commitment to giving patients more say and choice over their care and treatment.

We have heard that patients want greater clarity over when and how they can share in decisions about their care, about the choices they have and when they apply.

The consultation proposes a model of shared decision-making all along the patient pathway, which should be relevant irrespective of patients’ conditions, their clinical pathway or progress along it. The model indicates where patients would be expected to have more say in decisions about their care in primary care; before a diagnosis; at referral to secondary care; and after a diagnosis had been made.

It asks a small number of focussed questions to seek views on:

In July 2018, Philip Dunne MP published a review of the economic value of defence, highlighting the crucial role the sector plays in supporting over 260,000 jobs and contributing on average £7-billion in exports each year.

The Ministry of Defence invested £18.9-billion with UK industry in 2017/18, equating to £290 per resident, which supported 115,000 jobs across the country.

Ahead of today’s Prosperity Conference, bringing together leading defence industry partners in the Manufacturing Technology Centre in Coventry, the Defence Secretary has announced:

A year ago we were all stunned to silence by the colossal devastation caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.

In the face of such tragedy, the Japanese people showed tremendous resilience as they came to terms with losing thousands of their countrymen, and witnessing entire communities being wiped out.

Twelve months on and the Japanese people continue to sustain that courage and determination as they rebuild their communities, their homes and their lives. And I greatly admire and respect the way they have overcome the enormous challenges of recovery.

We stood by Japan in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake and we will continue to stand by the Japanese people and Government as they continue to reconstruct the Tohoku region.

Our relationship is founded on much more than just co-operation in the face of adversity. I hope we can continue to build on our strong commercial partnership, and our shared commitment to democracy, human rights, aid and trade."

Prior to the summit, Prime Minister David Cameron - who was attending his first international summit since becoming PM - had called on fellow world leaders to ensure that the G8 and G20 were “more than just grand talking shops”.

Mr Cameron had urged his counterparts to make good on their promise to fix the global economy and to push for trade, which he described as “the real stimulus” that economies need.

In an article in Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail, Mr Cameron said:

I come to the G8 and G20 in Muskoka and Toronto with a clear commitment to make sure these summits deliver for people. Too often, these international meetings fail to live up to the hype and the promises made. I’m sure other leaders would admit that…

I believe that if we want to make a difference, we need a tight focus on what we actually want to achieve, with leaders - including me - being willing to be held to account and made to live up to our promises. We need to show people that we can get real results by concentrating on key priorities and then driving them through relentlessly, year after year.

Mr Cameron held bilateral meetings with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Canadian PM Stephen Harper and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Friday.

Following the G8, the leaders moved on to Toronto for discussions on the world economy with the wider G20 group, which includes major economies like China, India and South Africa.

On his arrival in Canada on Thursday, the PM visited HMS Ark Royal which is taking part in an international fleet review later this month to mark the Canadian Navy’s centennial year.

He said:

The point of the Cabinet today is really to ask one fundamental question: what is it that we can do in government to help the economy to rebalance, to grow, and for businesses to start up, to invest and to employ people?

That is large businesses but also all the way down the chain to start-up businesses as well.

In an article for the Derby Telegraph, the Prime Minister said that the first part of the Government’s strategy for growth is to get to grips with the deficit. He said:

When the books don’t balance, there’s no confidence in the economy. And without confidence, there won’t be growth. That’s why we’ve taken tough and decisive action on the deficit. And it’s why we will stick to the measures we have put in place.

But balancing the books is only the first stage of how we get growth. The second - and just as important - is how we get behind Britain’s businesses and support the job creation we need. These jobs won’t come from government. They will come from Britain’s leading businesses.

During the Cabinet, MPs heard from local business people about the challenges they face and how Government can help.

This afternoon the Cabinet, Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Business Secretary Vince Cable and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles hosted the first meeting of Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) from across the country. These Partnerships are alliances between councils and companies, chaired by business professionals.

The Prime Minister said:

”Local Enterprise Partnerships are fundamental to the growth agenda. We believe that local people and local business leaders know best what works in their area.

That’s why we are shifting power from Whitehall and quangos to the local communities and local businesses who really understand the barriers to growth in their areas. An approach where partnerships are formed over parts of the country people actually identify with and that make sense to business and reflect markets, rather than the old arbitrary regional boundaries.”

So far 31 LEPs have been formed, covering more than 70% of England’s population. The partnership covering Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire is the fifth largest, representing more than 68,000 enterprises across the region.

The visit follows Defence Secretary Liam Fox’s announcement of new services for veterans, including a 24-hour helpline and additional mental health nurses.

The PM said:

It is a priority to do more to help the mental health issues that veterans in our country have. The fact is, for many people the mental scars that they have from the time they have served can actually be as serious as or sometimes even worse than the physical scars and we need to take it much more seriously as a country.

So I’m delighted that we are announcing extra mental health nurses out in the community. We are also announcing a 24-hour helpline so that people can always get hold of help when they need it and also it’s important to stress that we are going to work with organisations like Combat Stress that do brilliantly in helping those who bear the mental scars from their service in our armed forces.

During his tour of the centre, Mr Cameron spoke to veterans taking part in activities such as art to help manage their conditions and helped a group making poppies for Remembrance Sunday.

Combat Stress currently helps about 4,400 ex-servicemen and women at its three treatment centres in the UK.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nhs-whistleblowing-helpline-to-be-extended-to-social-care-staff,News story,NHS whistleblowing helpline to be extended to social care staff,The whistle-blowing helpline for NHS staff is being extended to staff and employers in the social care sector from 1 January.,Department of Health and Social Care,21 December 2011,"There is also a new number for the service, which encompasses all of the elements of the current helpline service and is free, independent and confidential.

The new helpline number will be 08000 724 725.

The helpline will operate on weekdays between 08.00 and 18.00 with an out-of-hours answering service available at weekends and on public holidays. A web-based service is also being developed.

You can contact the helpline if you have concerns but are unsure how to raise them or simply want advice on best practice.

The currently government-funded service will also change to a free-phone service provided by the Royal Mencap Society.

Mark Goldring, Mencap chief executive, said: ‘This initiative will give NHS staff and social care workers the confidence to report abuse or raise concerns about patient and service user safety without fear of victimisation or personal reprisal.

‘Through a free dedicated helpline we will provide confidential advice to individuals on how to report poor service, and we will advise organisations on how to develop best practice policy.

‘As an organisation that supports vulnerable people we take whistleblowing very seriously and understand the importance and the need for this essential service.’

Dean Royles, director of the NHS Employers organisation said: ‘Having a culture where staff feel able to raise concerns is essential. It’s good to have a national support line from a well-known and respected organisation and we look forward to working with them to develop support to employers that will assist them in implementing best practice and support staff to report concerns.’

Julie Jones, chief executive at the Social Care Institute for Excellence, said: ‘It’s really important that staff are able to discuss issues and concerns over safeguarding adults at risk. For instance, our Social Care TV film on safeguarding in care homes shows how safeguarding isn’t a taboo subject; it’s always on the table if people want to discuss it. As health and social care staff increasingly work together, it’s sensible to share a whistle-blowing helpline, so that, if all other factors fail, service users and their families can be reassured that staff have this option.’

Cynthia Bower, Chief Executive of the Care Quality Commission, said: ‘Health and care professionals have a responsibility to raise concerns if they believe that patients or people who use services are being put at risk. The first course of action should be to raise these concerns within your organisation - but if you feel unable to, or if your voice is not being heard, it’s important to know that there are other options open to you. That’s why this helpline is so important.’"

The Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA), which was set-up in 2005 to protect temporary workers from exploitation in farming, shellfish gathering, and food processing, will refocus its efforts to stamp out abuses.

By freeing-up resources for inspectors to take action where it is needed most, the GLA will clamp down on high-risk labour providers who commit serious crime. It will also work more effectively with other agencies to track and address cases of human trafficking.

The GLA will remove unnecessary regulatory burdens and costs for responsible employers. It will also no longer regulate certain low-risk sectors where there are far fewer vulnerable workers or evidence of any criminal gangmaster operations.

Mr Paice said:

“This Government is committed to protecting vulnerable workers which is why we’ll be using a much more targeted approach to clamp down on the high-risk, criminal labour providers and users where action is most needed.

“Responsible employers who play by the rules will be freed from unnecessary costs and bureaucracy, allowing them to get on with the important job of running their business, while safeguarding the rights of their workers.”

Under the changes, the GLA will:

Welcoming the changes, GLA chair Margaret McKinlay said:

“GLA plays a vital role in protecting the interests of vulnerable workers. We welcome these changes which will really help us focus our efforts on the areas of high risk activity that will make a difference, while reducing the burdens for compliant businesses.

“We’ve already been looking to apply a light touch approach to licensing the businesses we regulate and have started to focus our efforts on areas where exploitation of workers may be more of a problem.”

The changes to the operation are following the Government’s Red Tape Challenge. Defra will now work up detailed proposals and consult on them within the next year, taking into account the outstanding Department for Business Innovation and Skills’ review of Workplace Compliance and Enforcement Rights."

Asked what discussions were taking place in relation to the Terms of Reference (ToR) for the inquiry, the PMS said the ToR were being worked on.

Asked when there would be any information or an announcement made about the inquiry, the PMS said that discussions were taking place with relevant Select Committee members and others and that any announcement would reflect those. Put that it was ultimately a Government decision, he said it was, but due to public interest, we were listening to people’s views before any announcement.

Asked what the Prime Minister meant when he said that Murdoch’s priorities should be sorting out current issues before considering commercial deals, the PMS said it was self explanatory; he should be focusing on the immediate issues.

Asked about the cost of the inquiry and who would pay, the PMS pointed out that clearly there would be costs, but benefits too. He explained that the process was set out in the legislation.

Asked if the PM had seen any of the people involved in the latest hacking allegations, the PMS said it was highly unlikely as the PM had been travelling to Wales.

Asked what the PM’s reaction was to the latest raft of allegations involving former Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, the PMS said it was very disturbing, particularly allegations that the medical records of a child may have been accessed.

Asked if the current Downing Street Director of Communication had been in touch with his predecessor over the last few weeks, the PMS said he doubted he had.

Asked what the PM’s view was on the eurozone situation, the PMS advised the lobby to speak to Treasury about recent developments. Asked about the Greater Fiscal Union and concerns where it might lead, the PMS said that the current focus was on the immediate issues in relation to Greece.

Asked if the PM had any views on the International Monetary Fund vote, the PMS said the Government’s position was that we support it.

Asked why our subscription was going up so much, the PMS directed the lobby to speak to Treasury about the details."

Asked to clarify who the Performance Related Pay figures covered, the PMS said that it covered all PRP for civil servants from all Departments for the last performance year, that is 2010/11.  Asked about the timing of the data releases during the day, the PMS clarified that PRP figures had already been published but as each Department was publishing its own GPC card data this would be coming out during the course of the day, she also confirmed that this would include data from the MoD.  Asked why data was only being published from April onwards, the PMS explained that this was just the first data being published and confirmed that there would be regular publications in the future.  She also reminded the Lobby that this was a step forward for transparency as this data had not been published previously.

Asked about the general feeling on progress overnight in Brussels, the PMS repeated the Chancellor and Foreign Secretary’s messages that good progress has been made on the key issues that we’ve been pressing on, the three main issues being recapitalisation of banks, reinforcing the firewall, and resolving the Greek situation.  We have reached a good agreement and now we want to see the detail and see that momentum is maintained.  We are pleased that the pressure has paid off but are under no illusions, there is a difficult road ahead.  It is the Prime Minister’s view that it is right that he was there while the conversation is ongoing because there are elements like the recapitalising of banks that do affect all 27 countries.  Asked if the recapitalising would affect UK banks, the PMS said that we would need to see the detail but we have already recapitalised our banks.

Asked to comment on the prospect of a Eurozone President, the PMS said that as the Chancellor had said this morning, the Eurozone needs to resolve its issues and there are some issues which the Eurozone have to deal with themselves.  The important thing is that where issues affect the 27 countries all 27 countries are involved. Asked if we had a view on who the Eurozone President should be or what background they should come from, the PMS said it was too early to comment.

Asked if the Prime Minister is concerned that if there is a development the UK will be left behind, the PMS explained that the Chancellor would be addressing these issues in his statement, but it is clear that there are issues that the Eurozone alone needs to resolve like greater fiscal union.  It is important for the UK to maintain a voice and influence as part of the 27 and that the 27 act as a 27 and we still have a strong European Union.  The PMS reminded the Lobby that there are still great benefits to the European Union single market, we want to see a strengthened and reformed single market and that is something we will discuss as a 27.  Asked if this was the start of a two-tier Europe, the PMS repeated that there are countries that are in the Eurozone and countries that aren’t, that has not changed; we are still part of the European Union, she said.

Asked about the potential for China to be involved in the bail out the PMS reiterated that we need to see the detail but she made the point that the fact remains that we were in a better position now than we were the previous day.  Asked to comment on suggestions that by 2020 Greek debt will still be 120 per cent of GDP, necessitating another bail out, the PMS repeated that we would need to see more detail of the deal in the coming days and weeks.  Asked if the Prime Minister expected to see significant treaty change and if this would require a referendum, the PMS said that we expected only limited treaty change but we need to see the detail.

Asked if the Prime Minister had confidence in Ken Clarke following his U-turn on jailing juveniles for knife crime, the PMS reminded the Lobby of the Prime Minister’s position as set out in June - that we want to see a new sentencing regime which will be better understood by the public and command greater confidence.  On juvenile knife crime specifically we need to send out a clear message about the seriousness of this and that is what is behind the proposals.  Asked if it is the Prime Minister’s view that it should be made more difficult for those currently serving indeterminate sentences to have their sentences reduced, the PMS clarified that as proposals are not retrospective changes would only affect those who are going through the court when the Bill receives Royal Assent.   It is up to the Parole Board to decide when prisoners currently on indeterminate sentences should be released, the key factor being that they don’t present a risk to the public.  Asked why the Justice Secretary had changed his mind on the issue of knife crime, the PMS said that this was something the Government had been looking at, it is Government policy that we want to review sentences and send a clear message that people who commit crimes will be punished.  We have published our amendments and these will go forward and be debated in the House.

Asked if the Prime Minister has a view on whether protestors should leave St Paul’s, the PMS said that the Prime Minister had not expressed a particular view.  People have a right to peaceful protest but this is a matter for the Mayor and the authorities of St Paul’s."

The government has today accepted the recommendation from the independentMedicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)to approve Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine for use. This follows months of rigorous clinical trials and a thorough analysis of the data by experts at the MHRA who have concluded that the vaccine has met its strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness.

TheJoint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations (JCVI)will shortly publish its final advice for the priority groups to receive the vaccine, including care home residents, health and care staff, the elderly and the clinically extremely vulnerable.

The vaccine will be made available across the UK from next week. The NHS has decades of experience in delivering large-scale vaccination programmes and will begin putting their extensive preparations into action to provide care and support to all those eligible for vaccination.

To aid the success of the vaccination programme it is vital everyone continues to play their part and abide by the necessary restrictions in their area so we can further suppress the virus and allow the NHS to do its work without being overwhelmed.

Further details will be set out shortly."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ofsted-begins-series-of-no-notice-school-inspections,Press release,Ofsted begins series of no notice school inspections,HM Inspectors are mounting a wave of no notice inspections of schools across every region in England.,Ofsted,15 September 2014,"Around 40 schools up and down the country have been selected for the two-day unannounced inspections during a two-week window in September, under powers already available to the inspectorate.

Following recent events in some Birmingham schools, Chief Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw agreed to examine the feasibility of moving to a system of inspecting all schools without notice, rather than the half-day notice that the majority of schools currently receive.

In the meantime, he has instructed Ofsted’s Regional Directors to make wider use of existing powers to conduct no notice inspections of schools where there are concerns about:

Many of the schools selected for these inspections over the coming days were already scheduled to undergo ‘section 5’ inspections this term. However, others will be schools that weren’t due for inspection but where Ofsted has become aware of concerns.

HM Chief Inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, said:

Parents rightly expect Ofsted inspections to get to the heart of any problems that may exist in a school – whether they are to do with discipline, safeguarding, poor leadership or governance, or a narrow, unbalanced curriculum. That’s why we’ve expanded the criteria for conducting unannounced inspections for the coming year.

I’m currently giving thought to whether Ofsted should move to more routine no notice inspections as part of our wider education inspection reforms, which we will be consulting on later this year.

In the meantime, under our regional structure, inspectors are well placed to use their local knowledge and contacts to identify where these sorts of problems may be taking hold so we can respond swiftly and report publically on what we find.

Ofsted will continue to carry out unannounced inspections throughout the academic year. By conducting the first wave within a two-week window, Ofsted will be able to make an early assessment of their impact.

A full report for every inspection will be published on the Ofsted website.

In addition to the current programme of no notice inspections, HM Inspectors have made their first return visits to the five Birmingham schools placed in special measures in June after the inspections uncovered serious leadership, governance and safeguarding concerns. Every school placed in special measures by Ofsted is subject to a regular series of monitoring visits by HM Inspectors to check that the problems identified in the original inspection are being addressed.

Sir Michael last week joined the inspection team at one of these schools, Park View Academy, where he met the acting executive principal and the trustees to assess whether the school’s improvement plan is starting to tackle the key areas for improvement.

The outcome of each of these monitoring inspections will be published shortly.

Sir Michael wrote to schools in July 2014 to outline upcoming changes to inspection. This includes the move to greater use of no-notice inspections.The letter is available online.

The Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted) regulates and inspects to achieve excellence in the care of children and young people, and in education and skills for learners of all ages. It regulates and inspects childcare and children’s social care, and inspects the Children and Family Court Advisory Support Service (Cafcass), schools, colleges, initial teacher training, work-based learning and skills training, adult and community learning, and education and training in prisons and other secure establishments. It assesses council children’s services, and inspects services for looked after children, safeguarding and child protection.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-launches-second-animal-welfare-bill-to-protect-pets-livestock-and-wild-animals,Press release,"Government launches second Animal Welfare Bill to protect pets, livestock and wild animals",The new Bill will improve welfare standards through a wide range of measures,"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs and The Rt Hon George Eustice",8 June 2021,"New powers to crack down on puppy smuggling and increased protections for farm animals will be brought in under new legislation set to be introduced by the Government in Parliament today (8 June).

The new Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill will improve welfare standards through a wide range of measures for pets, farmed and kept wild animals, including through a ban on keeping primates as pets.

The UK has long history of leading the way on animal welfare and now that we have left the EU, the Government is committed to improving our already world-leading standards by delivering a series of ambitious reforms, outlined in theAction Plan for Animal Welfare.

Puppy smuggling: The Government will introduce new powers to tackle the unethical trade of puppy smuggling by reducing the number of pets (dogs, cats and ferrets) that can travel under pet travel rules. It will also include powers for the Government to bring in further restrictions on the movement of pets on welfare grounds, for example by increasing the minimum age of imported puppies and restricting the import of pregnant dogs and dogs with mutilations such as cropped ears and tails.

Live exports: Live animals can endure excessively long journeys during export, causing distress and injury. EU rules prevented any changes to these journeys, but the UK Government is now free to pursue plans which would see a ban on the export of live animals for slaughter and fattening. We will become the first European country to end this practice.

Banning keeping primates as pets: Primates are highly intelligent animals with complex needs and require specialist care. The Government will deliver on its manifesto commitment to introduce a ban on keeping them as pets, ensuring that all primates being kept privately in England are being kept at zoo-level standards and that those unable to meet the standards are phased out.

Livestock worrying: The Bill will give new powers to the police to provide greater protection to livestock from dangerous and out of control dogs. The Bill will also extend this protection to other species such as llamas, ostriches and game birds.

Zoos: The Zoo Licensing Act will be amended to improve zoo regulations and ensure that zoos are doing more to contribute to conservation.

The Kept Animals Bill will bring in some of the world’s highest and strongest protections for pets, livestock and kept wild animals.

As an independent nation outside the EU we are now able to go further than ever on animal welfare by banning the export of live animal exports for slaughter and fattening, prohibiting keeping primates as pets and bringing in new powers to tackle puppy smuggling.

This builds on the launch of our Action Plan for Animal Welfare and Animal Sentience Bill last month as part of our work to build on our status as a world leader on animal welfare.

Today’s announcement is the second piece of legislation introduced in the last month aimed at driving better standards of animal welfare. It follows the Government’s decision to formally recognise animals as sentient beings in domestic law through theAnimal Welfare (Sentience) Billwhich was introduced to Parliament on 13 May.

As well as the new Kept Animals Bill, the Government will also announce a series of further reforms this year related to microchipping, pet theft, farm animal welfare and tackling wildlife crime, as laid out in our Action Plan for Animal Welfare.

Every day veterinary practices see the devastating consequences of illegal pet smuggling. Puppies that have been poorly bred and taken away from their mothers at a very young age often suffer from disease, other health problems, and poor socialisation leading to heartache and financial costs for new owners. We welcome changes to the law that will stop criminal gangs abusing pet travel rules for profit.

We’re also delighted to see that the Government has moved a step closer to a ban on the import of cropped and docked dogs, putting an end to the alarming trend of ear cropping that vets have been campaigning on.

We are thrilled to see the commitments being made by the Government in the Kept Animals Bill and are hopeful for the impact the bill could make to dog welfare. We are particularly encouraged by the measures set out to crack down on puppy smuggling, an issue we have been campaigning on for over six years.

We have seen firsthand the devastating impact of this cruel trade, having rescued over 1.5 thousand illegally imported puppies, who have had the most traumatic start to their young lives and have come into our care in horrific conditions.

We will continue to work closely with the Government to be the voice for dogs and ensure all proposed legislation involving dogs effects real change.

This bill marks a crucial milestone in animal welfare as we are set to become the first country in Europe to ban the live export of animals for slaughter and fattening.

We are also thrilled to see measures to crack down on the import of puppies - a cruel trade where criminals get rich selling sick and dying puppies to unsuspecting families, which has boomed during lockdown. Any steps to restrict the import of dogs with cropped ears will also send a powerful message against the painful and unnecessary mutilation of dogs for fashion and the ban on keeping primates of pets means these amazing animals will no longer be kept in homes where they simply cannot be cared for properly.

This is a really important time for animal welfare and, if we get it right, we can make real and lasting changes to the lives of animals here and abroad.

To encourage higher standards abroad, later this year the Government will be introducing further legislation on international animal welfare and conservation work. It will build on recent animal welfare achievements including increasing the maximum custodial penalty for animal cruelty offencesfrom six months to five years.

Since 2010, the Government has also brought in mandatory microchipping for dogs to help reunite lost dogs with their owners and has introduced additional protection for service animals by introducing‘Finn’s Law’. Last year, the Government introducedLucy’s Lawto tackle puppy farming by banning the commercial third-party sales of puppies and kittens. In 2019, the Government also outlawed the use ofwild animals in circuses."

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-science-and-technology-minister-launches-new-global-international-science-partnership-funding-in-tokyo-with-initial-119m-of-funding,News story,UK Science and Technology Minister launches new global international science partnership funding in Tokyo with initial £119m of funding,Minister Freeman announces new global research fund to deepen collaboration between the UK and international R&D powers like Japan.,"Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy and George Freeman MP",14 December 2022,"A new global research fund to deepen scientific collaboration between the UK and international R&D powers like Japan will be opened with an initial £119 million in UK Government funding, UK Science Minister George Freeman announced yesterday (Tuesday 13 December) in Tokyo, Japan.

The UK Science Minister was in Tokyo, Japan yesterday to announce the first phase of the new International Science Partnerships Fund (ISPF). The fund will support and fund UK scientists and innovators to work with peers around the world on some of the most pressing issues facing our world.

In a keynote speech to scientists, investors, industrialists and global research leaders, Minister Freeman set out the UK’s plans to take a more global approach to science, innovation and business.

This will involve collaborating with partners across the world to both drive innovation, investment and prosperity in the UK, while also strengthening the UK’s leadership in tackling the big global challenges facing the globe; from leading the fight to tackle global warming to harnessing new energy like fusion, cleaning up the oceans and making space safe and sustainable.

UK Science and Technology Minister George Freeman said:

“The UK has a well-earned reputation for world-class science and research, and an extremely vibrant start-up enterprise sector. But being a Science Superpower means ensuring we don’t just win prizes but invest in the appliance of science for global good: collaborating more deeply with other leading nations to tackle the urgent global challenges facing our planet.

“This Fund will help the UK deepen our global research network in Japan and beyond tackling some of humanity’s greatest challenges.”

The Japan visit follows Minister Freeman’s securing of a Memorandum of Understanding on science with European science powerhouse Switzerland earlier this year.

The announcement comes as the UK is facing continued block by the EU to membership of the Horizon, Copernicus and Euratom projects. While this partnership is not aimed as a replacement to our European collaborations, the Government cannot wait forever to invest through association.

The government’s top priority is to invest in the UK’s world leading R&D sector and facilitate their collaborations with international counterparts. It is disappointing that while the government continues to focus on strengthening the UK’s international links and collaborations globally, the EU’s persistent delays to the UK’s association to Horizon is damaging collaboration with European partners. Association remains the UK’s preference, but the government cannot wait forever to invest through association.

One of the projects announced as part of the UK-Japan collaboration includes a research collaboration in neuroscience, neurodegenerative diseases and dementia, aimed at tackling the growing health issues associated with the both the UK and Japan’s ageing populations.

Full details of aims and partners of the ISPF program will be released in the new year.

UKRI’s international champion Professor Christopher Smith said:

“Today’s announcement is a positive first step in the development of this important new international fund. Research and Innovation know no boundaries nor do the multiple challenges we face from pandemics to conflict, climate change to economic shocks.

“International collaboration is integral to ensuring the UK harnesses the extraordinary potential of research and innovation to enrich and improve the lives of people living in the UK and around the world. Having a specific fund to enable international collaboration will help the UK achieve this vision. UKRI will help to deliver ISPF bringing benefits for the UK research and innovation sector and our international partners.”

Alongside the launch of the multi-million-pound fund, Science Minister Freeman today (Wednesday 14 December) also launched a further £15.5 million investment in the ISThe Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) experiment, which is a next generation global neutrino experiment in Japan.

The experiment aims to measure the properties of neutrinos, a type of particle, which aim to provide a “microscope,” used to observe the very smallest of particles, and also a “telescope” for observing the Sun and supernovas. The experiment is hoped to give us a greater understanding of the properties of the universe.

The UK has already invested £4.2m in the R&D phase of the Hyper-K project between 2014 and 2020, and this additional investment will ensure the UK is able to play a leading role in this cutting-edge research."

The tool will build and connect 2 new supercomputers across the UK, giving researchers access to resources with more than 30-times the capacity of the UK’s current largest publicAIcomputing tools. They will be able to use the machines, which will be running from summer 2024, to analyse advancedAImodels to test safety features and drive breakthroughs in drug discovery and clean energy.

The investment into theAIResearch Resource has been tripled to £300 million, up from £100 million announced in March 2023, in a bid to further boost UKAIcapabilities.

This will bolster Isambard-AI, which will be Britain’s most advanced computer. Based at the University of Bristol, it is set to be 10 times faster than the UK’s current quickest machine, thanks to 5,000 advancedAIchips from Nvidia in a supercomputer built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE).

The investment will also connect Isambard-AIto a newly announced Cambridge supercomputer called ‘Dawn’. This computer – delivered through a partnership with Dell and UK SME StackHPC – will be powered by over 1000 Intel chips that use water-cooling to reduce power consumption. It is set to be running in the next 2 months and target breakthroughs in fusion energy, healthcare and climate modelling.

Chaired by Ian Hogarth, the FrontierAITaskforce will have priority access to the connected computing tools to support its work to mitigate the risks posed by the most advanced forms ofAI, including national security from the development of bioweapons and cyberattacks. The resource will also support the work of theAISafety Institute, as it develops a programme of research looking at the safety of frontierAImodels and supports government policy with this analysis.

Announcing this investment at theAISafety Summit at Bletchley Park, Science, Innovation and Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan said:

FrontierAImodels are becoming exponentially more powerful. At ourAISafety Summit in Bletchley Park, we have made it clear that Britain is grasping the opportunity to lead the world in adopting this technology safely so we can put it to work and lead healthier, easier and longer lives.

This means giving Britain’s leading researchers and scientific talent access to the tools they need to delve into how this complicated technology works. That is why we are investing in building UK’s supercomputers, making sure we cement our place as a world-leader inAIsafety.

Bristol’s Isambard-AIcomputer, firstannounced in September, will be backed by a £225 million investment.

The supercomputer, 10 times faster than the UK’s current fastest machine, will deliver over 200 ‘petaflops’, meaning it can make 200,000,000,000,000,000 calculations (that’s 200 quadrillion) every second. By comparison, the newest smartphones today deliver only trillions of calculations per second, and a human would have to make a decision every second for 6.3 billion years to match what this computer can calculate in one second."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/homeowners-protected-squatters-criminalised,Press release,"Homeowners protected, squatters criminalised",Homeowners are to receive better protection as squatting in residential buildings becomes a criminal offence.,Ministry of Justice and Crispin Blunt,31 August 2012,"Homeowners are to receive better protection as squatting in residential buildings becomes a criminal offence for the first time in England and Wales from tomorrow, 1 September, Justice Minister Crispin Blunt said.

Last summer the Government publicly consulted on options to tackle squatting, including making it a criminal offence for the first time; sending persistent offenders to prison and abolishing so-called ‘squatters rights’. Following the consultation the Government decided to criminalise squatting in all residential buildings to deal once and for all with the misery that squatting can cause.

Justice Minister Crispin Blunt said:

‘For too long squatters have had the justice system on the run and have caused homeowners untold misery in eviction, repair and clean-up costs. Not any more. Hard working homeowners need and deserve a justice system where their rights come first - this new offence will ensure the police and other agencies can take quick and decisive action to deal with the misery of squatting.’

The offence will be punishable by a maximum prison term of up to six months, a £5000 (maximum) fine or both.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

‘For too long, hardworking people have faced long legal battles to get their homes back from squatters, and repair bills reaching into the thousands when they finally leave.

‘No longer will there be so-called ‘squatters rights’. Instead, from next week, we’re tipping the scales of justice back in favour of the homeowner and making the law crystal clear: entering a property with the intention of squatting will be a criminal offence. And by making this change, we can slam shut the door on squatters once and for all.’

Association of Chief Police Officers lead on Uniformed Operations, Chief Constable Phil Gormley, said:

‘Our experience is that the problem of squatting varies between police forces and it is more pressing in some areas than others.

‘However, police can now act immediately and remove squatters directly from properties in line with the new legislation and ensure people’s homes are protected.’

The new offence will protect homeowners or legitimate tenants who have been excluded from their homes.

It will also protect those who own residential buildings that they don’t live in, such as landlords, local authorities or second home owners. Previously, their only option was to seek a civil court order to regain possession of their properties, which could be time consuming, expensive and stressful."

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/transforming-rehabilitation-less-crime-fewer-victims-safer-communities,Press release,"Transforming Rehabilitation - less crime, fewer victims, safer communities",The most significant reforms to tackling reoffending and managing offenders in the community for a generation were set out today by Justice …,Ministry of Justice and The Rt Hon Chris Grayling,9 January 2013,"The most significant reforms to tackling reoffending and managing offenders in the community for a generation were set out today by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling.

Consistently high reoffending rates have led to the radical overhaul with almost half of all prison-leavers reoffending within 12 months - for those serving less than a year that figure rises to almost 58 per cent. And half a million crimes are committed by convicted crooks each year.

Under plans laid out in the consultation ‘Transforming Rehabilitation’, a new refocused and streamlined public sector service will be tasked with keeping the public safe from the most dangerous and high-risk offenders. Private and voluntary sector organisations will work together on closing the ‘revolving door’ of the criminal justice system by tackling lower risk offenders.

For the first time all offenders, including those serving less than 12 months, will be subject to mandatory supervision and tailored rehabilitation on release from prison.

The proposals call for a greater use of mentors who will meet offenders at the prison gate, supporting them in all aspects of their life from day one in the community, including help finding work and accommodation, tackling drug and alcohol addictions and addressing literacy and educational problems.

The new approach is expected to deliver steady year on year reductions in reoffending across England and Wales as the best from all sectors pool knowledge and resources to help break the cycle of crime.

Chris Grayling said:

‘What we do at the moment is send people out of prison with £46 in their pocket, and no support at all. No wonder we have such high levels of reoffending. It is madness to carry on with the same old system and hope for a different result.

‘We know across the public, private and voluntary sectors there is a wealth of expertise and experience - we need to unlock that so we can finally begin to bring down our stubbornly high reoffending rates.

‘Our proposals will see all of those sentenced to prison or probation properly punished while being helped to turn away from crime for good. They will also mean we only spend taxpayers’ money on what works when it comes to cutting crime.’

The new approach will see that private providers are only be paid in full if they reduce reoffending in their area through Payment by Results contracts. The proposals are intended to drive innovation and efficiency through the criminal justice system.

The paper sets out a strong role for the public sector Probation Service. It will focus on protecting the public by managing the most high risk offenders, including all serious sexual and violent offenders, providing advice to courts and making initial risk assessments on all offenders. The public sector will retain ultimate responsibility for public protection in all cases.

These proposals build on a previous consultation last year which set out plans to compete out probation services and increase the use of Payment by Results.

As part of these plans, we will see England and Wales divided into areas which align closely with Local Authorities and Police and Crime Commissioners. Private and voluntary sector organisations will then be invited to bid for work in these areas with each contract awarded based on best value and innovation in tackling reoffending.

We intend to set out our final reforms in the spring with the roll-out across England and Wales by spring 2015.

To help support the proposed reforms, Government will be launching a nationwide ‘Justice Data Lab’. Organisations working to rehabilitate offenders at a local level will have access to high-quality reoffending data specific to the group of offenders they have been working with. This will allow them to focus only on what works, better demonstrate their effectiveness and ultimately cut crime in their area.

We are also providing £500,000 to voluntary and community sector groups to ensure they are ready to begin bidding for services.

This work follows reforms to community sentences so each one contains an element of punishment and the roll-out of work in prisons so offenders have a better chance of finding employment on release."

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/a-working-chance,News story,A working chance,"Jocelyn Hillman, explains how the charity Working Chance is helping female offenders move across the social divide.",Ministry of Justice,22 March 2013,"Jocelyn Hillman, explains how the charity Working Chance is helping female offenders move across the social divide.

Working Chance is a charity which places women ex-offenders into jobs with quality employers. It is headed up by Jocelyn Hillman, who is proving that, with support and encouragement, women whose lives have taken a wrong turn can re-join the workforce and become productive and respected members of society.

Getting a woman into work is the best way to stop her re-offending. Quite simply, a woman with a job has structure in her life, money in her pocket and pride in her progress.

This is why I welcome the announcement of the Government’s strategic priorities for female offenders along with the establishment of the Advisory Board for Female Offenders. It shows the Government understands the value of such rehabilitation in terms of the benefits socially and economically.

The women who come to us for help are usually the sole breadwinner for their families: they want to earn a living and be strong role-models to their children.

Working Chance’s model of providing women ex-offenders with professional recruitment services before and after release ensures that they are better equipped to make the transition from custody to finding employment. In this way, they become independent, empowered and contributing members of society, better able to support themselves and their families.

In our experience, whether an ex-offender engages with a service depends on how much she values it.  She will choose to engage with a service if it is of a high quality and responds to her needs.  The fact that we provide such a service means that we are dealing with women who are at a point in their journey where they are ready to engage and be helped.

Our offering is unique: we provide a quality, bespoke recruitment service for female ex-offenders in London and the southeast. Our way of working mirrors those of a high-end commercial recruitment agency.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-adopts-cloud-first-policy-for-public-sector-it,Press release,Government adopts 'Cloud First' policy for public sector IT,The launch of an expanded G-Cloud supplier framework will support growth in cloud computing.,Cabinet Office and The Rt Hon Lord Maude of Horsham,5 May 2013,"Purchases through the cloud should be the first option considered by public sector buyers of IT products and services, the government has confirmed today.

The formal introduction of a ‘Cloud First’ policy will drive wider adoption of cloud computing in the public sector, boosting business – and furthering savings and efficiencies – through the governmentCloudStore, which is a quicker, cheaper and more competitive way for the public sector to buy IT, Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office, said today.

In future, when procuring new or existing services, public sector organisations should consider and fully evaluate potential cloud solutions first – before they consider any other option. This approach is mandated to central government and strongly recommended to the wider public sector. Departments will remain free to choose an alternative to the cloud if they can demonstrate that it offers better value for money.

The announcement comes on the same day that thethird G-Cloud supplier framework goes liveproviding more choice for buyers through CloudStore, the online marketplace for cloud IT services, and more business opportunities for companies. In all, there are 708 companies on the new framework – of which more than 80% are SMEs – including 368 firms new to G-Cloud.

Francis Maude said:

G-Cloud brings a step change in the way government buys IT. It’s quicker, cheaper and more competitive, open to a wider range of companies, including a majority of SMEs, and offers more choice and innovation.

Many government departments already use G-Cloud, but IT costs are still too high. One way we can reduce them is to accelerate the adoption of Cloud across the public sector to maximise its benefits. The Cloud First policy will embed the skills a modern civil service needs to meet the demands of 21st-century digital government and help us get ahead in the global race.

A recent NAO report recognised that the government’s efforts to cut the cost of government IT are working, with IT reforms and spending controls saving the taxpayer £316 million in 2011 to 2012 alone. G-Cloud is fundamental to public service and IT reform in creating a friction-free commissioning point for government IT services, and facilitating the move away from dependence on an oligopoly of large suppliers and lock-ins to long contracts. Government is also reviewing its governance arrangements in the IT area to create more agile structures that support delivery better, including delivery of cloud-based commissioning of commoditised IT services.

G-Cloud Programme Director Denise McDonagh said:

Sales from G-Cloud are rising steadily, with cumulative spend now over £18 million – two-thirds of it with SMEs. This is still small relative to overall government IT spend, and the transition to widespread purchasing of IT services as a commodity won’t happen overnight. The adoption of a Cloud First policy will give added impetus for Whitehall and the wider public sector to move in this direction – complementing our ongoing work to encourage Cloud adoption and to help buyers adapt to this way of purchasing IT, which is already showing results.

Off-the-shelf products from the Cloud can be up to 30% of the cost of bespoke solutions. Today’s launch of an expanded G-Cloud framework, with more companies offering an even greater range of products and services, will only enhance the cost and innovation benefits of a more competitive marketplace."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cameras-in-court-plans-revealed,News story,Cameras in court plans revealed,Courts in England and Wales will be more publicly accessible than ever before when television broadcasting is introduced.,Ministry of Justice and The Rt Hon Kenneth Clarke KC,10 May 2012,"Courts in England and Wales will be more publicly accessible than ever before when television broadcasting is introduced, Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke said today.

Plans to overturn the ban on filming and broadcasting from law courts were yesterday unveiled as part of the Queen’s Speech and will form part of the Crime and Courts Bill announced today.

Once the legal changes have been made broadcasting will be introduced initially at the Court of Appeal, where filming will be permitted of opening and closing legal arguments made by lawyers and the judgements handed down.

The Government will later look to allow filming at the Crown Court - but of judges’ sentencing remarks only. No victims, witnesses, offenders and jurors would be filmed.

Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke said:

‘We are bringing the concept of open justice into the modern age and in doing so we will make the courts more accessible to the public than ever before.

‘People have always had the right to go to watch proceedings in courts but in reality very few actually do.

‘By allowing broadcasting from courts we are now enabling many members of the public to see, for the first time, court proceedings as they happen.’

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/24-free-schools-to-open-across-england-this-year,Press release,24 free schools to open across England this year,The Government is giving parents new opportunities to put their child in a great local school by announcing that 24 free schools will open in September this year.,Department for Education and The Rt Hon Michael Gove,28 August 2011,"The Government is giving parents new opportunities to put their child in a great local school by announcing that 24 Free Schools will open in September this year. They are part of the Government’s drive to raise education standards across the country and tackle educational disadvantage.

Funding Agreements for all 24 schools aiming to open in September 2011 have now been agreed and signed. This means that all schools aiming to open this year now have full approval from the Government, and can make the very final preparations needed to welcome the first ever Free School pupils. The schools will open at different times during the month.

These new, state-funded schools - set up by teachers, charities, education experts and parents - will eventually provide thousands of new places for children across England, many in areas where there is a shortage. They will also open in areas with historic educational underperformance.

Under the Coalition Government’s radical new plans, Free Schools will also be able to prioritise the most disadvantaged children (eligible for Free School Meals) in their school admissions arrangements. With the Pupil Premium, there will be an even greater incentive for Free Schools to attract pupils that are most in need of high-quality education.

Education Secretary, Michael Gove, said:

The most important thing for any parent is to be able to send their child to a good local school, with high standards and strong discipline. That is why we are opening Free Schools across the country. I am delighted to announce that the first 24 will open this year.

Too many children are being failed by fundamental flaws in our education system. The weakest schools are concentrated in our poorest towns and cities, and we are plummeting down the international education league tables.

In spite of years of investment, the situation is worsening. Children from disadvantaged homes are still falling behind. A change of approach is vital.

By freeing up teachers and trusting local communities to decide what is best, our reforms will help to raise standards for children in all schools.

These schools have been set up in record time - responding faster to the urgent demand of parents for a new, or different, type of education to benefit local children and their families. They will open just 10 to 15 months after submitting initial plans to the Department for Education. In the past, it normally took between three and five years to set up a maintained school, with the few that were able to be set up by parents taking up to nine years.

Free Schools are funded by the Government, but have greater freedoms than schools run by local authorities. They are run by teachers - not local councils and not Westminster politicians - and have freedom over things like the length of the school day, the curriculum, and how they spend their money. They are not permitted to make a profit, and all funds raised must go back into improving education for pupils.

The freedoms that Free Schools and Academies have allow teachers to make decisions that are right for local children. International evidence shows that giving teachers and heads more freedom in the classroom helps to raise standards in education.

Charter schools in New York, which are similar to Free Schools, have been shown to dramatically close the gap separating inner-city neighbourhood students from those of the wealthiest suburbs - by 86 per cent in maths and 66 per cent in English.

The Harlem Children’s Zone charters have closed the achievement gap between black and white pupils at both elementary and middle school level.

Charter schools in Chicago close half of the achievement gap between disadvantaged inner-city public school students and middle-income students in suburban districts. This is despite the fact that these students entered the Charter Schools achieving lower scores on average than their public school peers.

At home, schools with greater independence are also excelling. From 2009 to 2010, results in Academies increased by an average of 7.8 percentage points (proportion of pupils in Academies achieving five or more GCSEs at A*-C, including English and maths) compared with the national average increase of 4.5 percentage points for all state schools.

A recent Public Accounts Committee report on Academies found that they have achieved rapid academic improvements and raised aspirations in some of the most challenging schools in the most deprived areas of the country.

26 per cent of the Academies inspected in 2009/2010 were rated outstanding by Ofsted compared to 13 per cent of secondary schools nationally. In addition, a lower proportion of Academies were rated inadequate compared to secondary schools nationally.  All of which is an achievement for Academies given that these Academies were generally starting from a low base and were in challenging circumstances.

Groups that were successful in applying to open a Free School went through a robust process to make sure they were suitable and capable to run a school. They had to:

Like other state-funded schools, Free Schools are inspected by Ofsted, will have their exam and test results published and will have to teach a broad curriculum. Action will be taken if results slip or if teaching isn’t up to scratch. Free Schools also have to abide by the same rules for pupil admissions as other schools - making sure that these are fair and inclusive of children from different backgrounds.

Letters to patients with updated guidance will be arriving from today and over the next 2 weeks. These set out practical steps people can follow to reduce their risk of catching the virus, including continuing to maintain strict social distancing and to keep their overall social contacts at low levels, such as working from home where possible.

The move follows the steady decrease in the number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalisations across the country for the last couple of weeks.

Senior clinicians, including the Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England, Dr Jenny Harries, have recommended that shielding advice is paused nationally from 1 April onwards, as supported by the latest scientific evidence and advice.

With the success of the UK’s COVID-19 vaccination programme, more than 9 in 10 clinically extremely vulnerable people are now vaccinated with their first dose, but it’s still important people continue to follow the national rules and take the additional precautions set out in the guidance to keep themselves as protected as possible.

Local councils and supermarkets will continue to provide support for those shielding until 31 March. If people have already registered for priority access to supermarket delivery slots, they will continue to be able to access these until 21 June 2021.

Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England, Dr Jenny Harries, said:

Shielding has always been an advisory measure to safeguard those who are the most clinically vulnerable in our communities. We recognise how difficult this period has been for so many and the impact it has had on people’s wellbeing.

With the prevalence of the virus in the community continuing to decrease now is the right time for people to start thinking about easing up on these more rigid guidelines.

If you have been shielding, we strongly urge you to take extra precautions following 1 April to keep yourself as safe as possible, such as continuing to observe social distancing and working from home.

We will continue to monitor all of the evidence and adjust this advice should there be any changes in infection rates.

People are still advised to continue working from home where possible, but if people are unable to do so, employers are required by law to take steps to make workplaces COVID-19 secure and should discuss this with their employees.

In February 2021, the government announced a new predictive risk model that helps clinicians identify additional people who may be at higher cumulative risk from COVID-19 due to the combination of their underlying risk factors.

Up to 1.7 million vulnerable individuals were identified by the tool, taking the total number of people in the shielded patient list up to 3.79 million people, as of 6 March 2021. As a result, over 800,000 more adults have been prioritised to receive a vaccine that weren’t already in the top four priority groups for phase one of vaccinations.

Updated guidance will be published on GOV.UK.

Read more about the COVID-19 Response - Spring 2021.

Figures on those on the shielded patient list are published by NHS Digital.

If you are aged 16 or older and have been advised you are clinically extremely vulnerable, you should already have been offered your first dose of the vaccine. If you have not yet received your first dose, please contact your GP.

If you have received your first dose, you should still ensure you take up your second dose of the vaccine when it is offered to you. Having 2 doses should further increase your level of protection.

No vaccine is 100% effective and therefore even if you have had both doses, there is still no absolute guarantee that you will not become ill from COVID-19. Therefore, you should continue to take the extra precautions set out in this guidance to help protect yourself.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/one-in-five-vascular-plant-species-are-threatened-with-extinction,News story,One in five vascular plant species are threatened with extinction,"'A Vascular Plant Red List for England' was launched at Kew Gardens today, presenting a comprehensive and objective analysis of changes in the distribution of our native flora to identify our most threatened species.",Natural England,17 September 2014,"The new Red List reveals that a fifth of England’s wildflower species are under threat, with the majority of these threatened species suffering a decline of 30% or more. Wildflowers associated with infertile soils, open habitats or highly acid or basic habitats, such as great sundew (Drosera anglica) or burnt-tip orchid (Orchis ustulata), fare particularly badly. The analysis also identifies species that have suffered such severe declines in lowland areas of England that they meet the ‘threatened’ criteria, despite being still relatively widespread and common in upland areas. These include the frog orchid (Coeloglossum viride), grass-of-Parnassus (Parnassia palustris) and common butterwort (Pinguicula vulgaris).

One major cause for concern is that a suite of wildflowers, once common and widespread across England have now declined across their entire range and are now close to being listed as threatened. These include familiar species such as as ragged-robin (Silene flos-cuculi), harebell (Campanula rotundifolia), quaking grass (Briza media), common rock-rose (Helianthemum nummularium) and cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix).

The Red List is the product of a partnership of 12 scientists from the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI), Natural England, the Centre of Ecology and Hydrology, the Natural History Museum, Plantlife and Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.

Red List lead author Dr Pete Stroh (BSBI) said “Whilst many of these ‘near threatened’ species are still found within nature reserves, they once had a much greater presence outside of protected areas. Following the widespread destruction or modification of vast swathes of unprotected countryside - particularly in lowland England - over the past 60 years, it is perhaps not so surprising to find out that these species have undergone such severe declines”.

Ian Taylor, specialist for the conservation of vascular plant species at Natural England, said: “The scientific rigour brought to the England Red List by a partnership of the country’s leading botanical organisations will enable us to target our conservation efforts more precisely and with greater confidence on those plants, habitats and landscapes revealed to be most urgently in need.”

The new Red List will play a vital role in helping Natural England to identify additional country-level priority taxa requiring conservation action, whether through appropriate management of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), designation of new SSSIs, targeting of agri-environment schemes and land management advice in the ‘wider countryside’, or projects funded by the Species Recovery Programme (SRP).

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/jcvi-issues-updated-advice-on-covid-19-booster-vaccination,Press release,JCVI issues updated advice on COVID-19 booster vaccination,The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has updated its advice on the COVID-19 vaccine booster programme.,Public Health England,14 September 2021,"The vast majority of the UK population has received a COVID-19 vaccine since the vaccine programme was launched in December 2020 – including 89.1% of the population who have received a first dose and 81% who have received both doses.

It is expected that coronavirus (COVID-19) infections will continue to circulate in the coming months, alongside seasonal influenza and other respiratory viruses.

The COVID-19 vaccines provide high levels of protection against hospitalisation or dying from the virus. To maintain this high level of protection through the coming winter, theJCVIis advising that booster vaccines be offered to those more at risk from serious disease, and who were vaccinated during Phase 1 of the vaccine programme (priority groups 1 to 9).

This includes:

TheJCVIadvises that the booster vaccine dose is offered no earlier than 6 months after completion of the primary vaccine course, in the same order as during Phase 1.

People vaccinated early during Phase 1 will have received their second dose approximately 6 months ago. Therefore, it would be appropriate for the booster vaccine programme to begin in September 2021, as soon as operationally practical.

Early data in older individuals from Public Health England (PHE) suggests that the protection provided by vaccines against severe COVID-19 decreases gradually over time.

Insufficient time has passed to know what levels of protection might be expected 6 to 12 months after the primary course. Taking a precautionary position, theJCVIconsiders that on balance it is preferable to maintain a high level of protection in vulnerable adults throughout winter.

TheJCVIadvises a preference for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for the booster programme, regardless of which vaccine brand someone received for their primary doses. This follows data from the COV-BOOST trial that indicates the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is well tolerated as a third dose and provides a strong booster response.

Alternatively, a half dose of the Moderna vaccine may be offered. Where mRNA vaccines cannot be offered, for example due to allergies, the AstraZeneca vaccine may be considered for those who received it previously.

Professor Wei Shen Lim, Chair of COVID-19 Immunisation for theJCVI, said:

The UK’s COVID-19 vaccination programme has been hugely successful in protecting people against hospitalisation and death, and the main aim of the booster programme is to prolong that protection and reduce serious disease as we head towards the colder months.

TheJCVIis advising that a booster dose be offered to the more vulnerable, to maximise individual protection ahead of an unpredictable winter. Most of these people will also be eligible for the annual flu vaccine and we strongly advise them to take up this offer as well.

The ComFluCOV trial indicates that co-administration of the influenza and COVID-19 vaccines is generally well tolerated with no reduction in immune response to either vaccine. Therefore, the two vaccines may be co-administered where operationally practical.

As most younger adults will only have received their second COVID-19 vaccine dose by late summer or early autumn, the benefits of booster vaccination in this group will be considered at a later time.

This advice is separate from, and does not supersede,recentJCVIadviceon a third primary dose for the severely immunosuppressed. TheJCVIwill review whether this group requires a further booster at a later date, following completion of their 3-dose primary course.

TheJCVIwill continue to review emerging scientific data, including data relating to the duration of immunity for those less vulnerable to severe outcomes from COVID-19.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-financial-support-for-the-uks-fishing-businesses-that-export-to-the-eu,Press release,New financial support for the UK’s fishing businesses that export to the EU,£23 million to support businesses affected by the COVID pandemic and adjusting to new export requirements.,"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, HM Treasury, Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland, The Rt Hon George Eustice, The Rt Hon Steve Barclay MP and David Duguid",19 January 2021,"Seafood exporters across the UK will receive government funding of up to £23 million, to support businesses which have been most adversely affected by the COVID pandemic and the challenges of adjusting to new requirements for exporting.

This is in recognition of the unique circumstances of the fishing sector, which has had the most significant new requirements to adjust to, and for whom even a short delay can lead to goods perishing - at a time when the industry is facing lower market prices and demand due to the pandemic.

The fund will be targeted at fishing export businesses who can evidence a genuine loss in exporting fish and shellfish to the EU. Support will be available immediately and paid retrospectively to cover losses incurred since 1 January 2021. The scheme will be targeted at small and medium enterprises and the maximum claim available to individual operators will be £100,000.

The Marine Management Organisation will administer the scheme on behalf of exporters across the UK. More details will be available on eligibility criteria in the coming days. The Government will be consulting industry across the UK and working with the devolved administrations on these eligibility criteria before they are confirmed.

This £23 million scheme will provide crucial support for fishermen and seafood exporters, who have experienced delays and a lack of demand for fish from the restaurant industry in the UK and Europe.

We are continuing to work closely with the fishing and aquaculture sectors to make sure that they are supported, and can continue to fish whilst contributing to the economies of our coastal communities.

This further £23 million package of support will help our hardworking fishing sector navigate the challenges of the next few months.

It is vital that no community nor region within our United Kingdom is left behind as we continue to support British jobs and build back better from the coronavirus pandemic.

This funding announcement is the latest step in the UK Government’s continued engagement with the senior representatives of the industry to identify specific problems and to apply rapid solutions. Those conversations are, of course, aimed at addressing immediate concerns, and at finding longer-term, sustainable solutions to the challenges that the industry faces.

Working with Scottish seafood business leaders, we want to get the best out of our exit from the Common Fisheries Policy and the opportunities that presents, as well maximising the investment package delivered by the UK Government.

In addition to funding, the UK Government will provide further support to businesses in adapting to new export processes. Defra and HMRC will be offering targeted, proactive and hands on support to fisheries exporters to help them successfully meet the new requirements. This includes a new training package and focused workshop sessions.

Seafood exports to the EU require specific procedures, customs declarations, Catch Certificates and Export Health Certificates (EHCs) and businesses have adapted to these requirements at speed. As seafood is a perishable product with a ‘just in time’ supply chain, it is important that the sector can export quickly.

The UK Government has been working closely with the seafood industry and individual businesses to support them through this period and to ensure that any errors or problems are tackled as early as possible. The situation has been improving over the last week and the flow of goods is improving, but we will do more.

Support provided to the industry includes:

Separately, the Prime Minister has also committed to providing a £100m fund to help modernise fishing fleets, the fish processing industry, and rejuvenate a historic and proud industry in the UK, on top of the £32m that will replace EU funding this year.

Now we have left the Common Fisheries Policy, as an independent coastal state, the UK has taken its independent seat at the Regional Fisheries Management Organisations, including the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission and the North Atlantic Fisheries Organisation. We have put in place a bilateral agreement with the EU, and a partnership agreement with Norway.

The UK-EU agreement returns 25% of the EU’s catch in UK waters (worth £146m) to Scottish, English, Welsh and Northern Irish fishermen, beginning at 15%. Increases in quota include key fish stocks such as North Sea cod, from 47% to 57 and North Sea hake, from 18% to 54% with a mechanism to exchange quota between the UK and EU.

The fishing industry has already been hit by the reduction in demand from the hospitality sector in the UK and other export markets as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic with market prices falling by as much as 40%. 
The measures announced today will therefore support the industry across the UK, during this challenging time and follow an unprecedented package of financial support already announced.

This financial support is in addition to the £9 million of support provided last year to support the sector in England, and support provided by the devolved administrations."

In his statement to the media, Steve Clinch, The Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents stated:

The MAIB’s investigation found that Hoegh Osaka’s stability did not meet the minimum international requirements for ships proceeding to sea. The cargo loading plan had not been adjusted for a change to the ship’s usual journey pattern and the number of vehicles due to be loaded according to the pre stowage plan was significantly different from than that of the final tally. The estimated weight of cargo was also less than the actual weight. Crucially, the assumed distribution of ballast on board, bore no resemblance to reality, which resulted in the ship leaving Southampton with a higher centre of gravity than normal.

This accident is a stark reminder of what can happen when shortcuts are taken in the interest of expediency. It is therefore imperative that working practices adopted by the car carrier industry ensure that there is always sufficient time and that accurate data is available on completion of cargo operations to enable the stability of such vessels to be properly calculated before departure.

Read the MAIBreport.

Asafety flyerfor the shipping  industry has also been produced summarising the accident and detailing the safety lessons learned.

The government intends for exams to take place next summer. But if they cannot go ahead safely or fairly due to the pandemic,contingency arrangementswill be in place to ensure that schools and colleges are well prepared to enable students to achieve their qualifications.

Following a consultation, the department and qualifications regulator Ofqual have confirmed students would receive Teacher Assessed Grades based on a range of their work, similar to this summer.

To help minimise workload burdens on teachers and students, Ofqual has today published guidance for teachers on how they should collect evidence of students’ work during the academic year. This guidance reflects feedback from teachers and school leaders to make it as clear and helpful as possible.

Exams are planned with adaptations next summer to recognise disruption to education during the pandemic and maximise fairness for students. These include a choice of topics in some GCSE exams and advance information on the focus of other exams to help students’ revision.

Exam boards are also publishing formulae and equation sheets to help students in GCSE maths and some GCSE science exams, giving students time to familiarise themselves with them before exams.

Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said:

Exams are the best and fairest form of assessment, and we fully intend for them to take place next summer. Planning is underway for exams to go ahead with adaptations to recognise the impact of the pandemic.

But it’s right, and I know schools and families would expect, that we have contingency plans in place so there is a safety net for students to gain their qualifications and progress to their next stage of education or employment, whatever the course of the pandemic.

Ofqual Chief Regulator Dr Jo Saxton said:

Students have shown so much resilience in the face of the pandemic.

The back-up plans announced today incorporate their feedback, and that of their teachers, and mean students don’t need to worry about the ‘what if?’. They can concentrate on what really matters - studying and revising - as they prepare to show what they know and can do.

The majority of schools, colleges and others who responded to the consultation broadly agreed with the proposals for Teacher Assessed Grades, with more than 70 per cent of people and organisations agreeing that Ofqual’s proposed guidance to support schools in collecting evidence was helpful or very helpful.

Ofqual’s guidance sets out what schools and colleges need to do in advance to ensure evidence is available for determining grades, to be used if exams are cancelled at a later date. Only at that stage would Ofqual and exam boards provide guidance on how to determine a grade, and on arrangements for quality assurance checks, and appeals.

The Ofqual guidance says that, in many cases, schools and colleges need only conduct their normal amount of assessment, and teachers should guard against over-assessment.

Advance information for next summer’s planned exams will be given in early February to help students focus their revision over the final months. The timing will be kept under review, subject to the course of the pandemic. The department has previously publishedcontingency guidance for vocational and technical qualifications.

The government has an ambitious and long-term education recovery plan, backed by an investment to date of nearly £5 billion. It will help children and young people to make up for lost learning and get back on track. This includes delivering world-class training for teachers, providing tutoring across the country, and extending time in colleges by 40 hours a year."

The new Research Collaboration Advice Team (RCAT) within the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) will promote government advice on security-related topics, such as export controls, cyber security and protection of intellectual property. It will ensure researchers’ work is protected, and that the UK research sector remains open and secure.

The government is committed to supporting the UK’s brilliant scientists, researchers and businesses to make the most of the enormous benefits that come from working with partners overseas. Last month we confirmed our association to the world’s largest collaborative research programme, Horizon Europe – worth around €95 billion over the next decade.

TheRCATteam will help researchers make the most of their collaborations while helping them to protect themselves from those who seek to compromise the UK’s national security. Such behaviour left unchecked can leave the UK vulnerable to disruption, unfair leverage, and espionage. The threats to science and research in particular– primarily the theft, misuse or exploitation of intellectual property by hostile actors - are growing, evolving and increasingly complex.

The team will respond to requests from British universities who have identified potential risks within current projects or proposals. Advisers will also proactively approach research institutions and support them to implement advice and guidance already on offer.

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said:

Keeping the country safe is the primary responsibility of any government, and it is essential that we do everything in our power to support our brilliant scientists and researchers in pursuit of our ambition to become a global science superpower.

This new team will give universities and institutions access to the latest advice on safe collaboration with international partners and protections against those who seek to harm the UK.

Science Minister Amanda Solloway said:

The UK is home to some of the world’s leading scientists and researchers. Their vital work over the past year in response to the pandemic demonstrates how crucial it is to foster an open yet secure environment for pioneering research.

Researchers need to take precautions when collaborating internationally, and this new team will support them as we cement our status as a science superpower.

The leadership of the new team will be based in Manchester, with advisers distributed across the UK.

Today’s announcement is the latest in a series of measures being taken by the government to keep the UK safe from hostile activity. Last month, the National Security and Investment Act received royal assent, strengthening the UK’s ability to investigate and intervene in potentially hostile mergers, acquisitions and other types of deals that could threaten our national security. The UK’s screening powers have also been extended to include assets like intellectual property, as well as companies.

Last year, the government supported Universities UK (UUK) to publish guidelines for the sector on managing security-related risks within international collaboration. These followed the launch of the government-funded Trusted Research campaign in 2019 by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure and National Cyber Security Centre, which helps UK universities and research institutions to make informed decisions about international collaboration and associated risks.

Professor Julia Buckingham, President, Universities UK said:

International collaboration lies at the heart of excellent research, delivers huge benefits to the UK and helps to ensure that we are recognised as a global science superpower. We have a responsibility to ensure that our collaborations are safe and secure, and our universities take these responsibilities very seriously.

Together withUUK’s guidelines on Managing Risk in Internationalisation, the work of this new team and the specialist advice and support it provides will help to ensure that the public can be confident in our research collaborations. We particularly welcome the creation of a single point of contact in government, which builds on recommendations made by Universities UK and will provide valuable insights for institutions and researchers.

Recruitment for the new team will begin this week."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/natural-solutions-for-tackling-health-inequalities-conference-report,News story,Natural solutions for tackling health inequalities: conference report,"The Institute of Health Equity (IHE) has published a report funded by Natural England, which highlights the growing evidence of the benefits of green spaces on health and wellbeing, and the differences in access to natural environments across England, which contribute to health inequalities.",Natural England,7 October 2014,"Thereporthas been published following last year’s ‘Natural solutions to tackling health inequalities’ conference, hosted by the nationaloutdoors for all working group. The conference attracted practitioners, academics and policy makers from over 70 organisations involved in health, diversity and environment at local and national levels.

The conference looked at evidence of the benefits of the natural environment to our health and, in particular, to those communities with the greatest need. It made some recommendations to improve inequalities that exist.

The report includes evidence that shows:

Duncan Selbie CEO of Public Health England, in his foreword to the report makes the point that: “Recognising the role of the natural environment as a primary determinant of health is, in many ways, the foundation of modern public health. Good health and wellbeing is not solely the absence of illness; the role of the environment we live in is hugely important in shaping our lives and, consequently, our health. So this report is a timely and very welcome contribution to increasing awareness of this amongst practitioners and policy makers, both in the health and environment sectors.”

Duncan concludes by saying: “So having access to high quality, local natural environments is critically important to promoting physical health and wellbeing in children and adults. Together, through this report, we have the opportunity to look afresh at what have hitherto appeared to be intractable public health challenges, and share our knowledge and experience of what works so that we can make a real difference to the quality of people’s lives.”

Dr Jessica Allen, Deputy Director at theIHE, University College London and lead author for the report, in summarising the evidence states: “Overall, better health is related to access to green space regardless of socio-economic status, and income-related inequality in health is moderated by exposure to green space. So, increasing the amount and quality of green space can be part of a low cost package to address health inequalities, improve health outcomes and deliver other benefits.”

Natural England’sMonitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE)survey also reveals that some social groups visit the natural environment far less frequently than the rest of the population. It is these groups that often suffer the greatest health inequality, and it is these groups that could benefit the most from increased access to the natural environment. Together these communities are a very significant proportion of the English population and their numbers are growing:

National outdoors for all working group members are now actively working with the health and environment sectors to help implement the report’s recommendations."

This comes in response to Ukrainian requests for more air defence capabilities, and the missiles will play a vital role in the provision of air defence for Ukraine and the protection of its critical infrastructure which is being continually targeted by Russia.

The missiles can be used in conjunction with existing Armed Forces of Ukraine capabilities. The equipment consists of launchers and missiles and is capable of shooting down air targets, including Russian drones and cruise missiles.

This commitment of hundreds more surface to air missiles continues our defensive support for Ukraine against Russian aggression - and will help Ukraine counter the threat from illegal targeting of critical national infrastructure.

The announcement comes as Defence Secretary has today visited two training sites where over 7,400 Ukrainian recruits have been trained by UK forces alongside eight partner nations.

At the sites being used for training, the Defence Secretary welcomed the NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the morning, and his counterparts from the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) nations this afternoon, some of whom were able to see their own military personnel conducting the training.

Currently 1,900 Ukrainian recruits are in the UK taking part in the training programme and will soon return to their home country. When they complete the training, they are provided with items including combat clothing, body armour and ear defence, waterproofs and sleeping bags.

Recruits are also issued with a fully stocked individual First Aid Kit after learning how to use tourniquets, field dressings and chest seals during training. Recruits leaving the UK will now be provided with extreme cold weather kits, announced by the Prime Minister today, including 25,000 set of extreme cold weather clothing, 20,000 sleeping bags and 150 insulated tents.

The announcement comes in response to Ukrainian requests for more cold weather equipment. Ukraine’s troops continue to battle to liberate their country from Russian forces as winter rapidly approaches, when temperatures can sink to minus 20°C and below in parts of the country.

Heavy duty sleeping bags and roll mats, combined with heated accommodation and personal winter clothing, will help to prevent cold-related injuries and ensure troops can operate effectively and efficiently.

We have equipped more than 9,000 Ukrainian recruits to ensure they have the necessary personal protective equipment, including helmet, body armour and webbing, to aid them in fighting against Russian aggression. The effort to support this from across the entire logistic community has been hugely impressive and no small undertaking.

The Ukrainian recruits, many of whom have little to no military experience, have shown exemplary courage, resilience, and a desire to learn which is deeply humbling to observe. Our instructors have done an excellent job in training these recruits to live and fight using their new equipment and transforming them from civilians to soldiers in just five weeks."

Jens Stoltenberg will be the first international leader the Prime Minister has hosted at 10 Downing Street since he took office last month.

The leaders are expected to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine and how best allies can support their courageous defence. They will also look to the future of the NATO alliance and how we can ensure it is fighting fit for generations to come.

The meeting will be an opportunity for to discuss the UK’s ongoing update to the Integrated Review. The update builds on the strategy published last year which highlighted NATO’s central role in the UK’s defence. The UK is the largest European contributor to NATO, and has committed both our aircraft carrier and our nuclear capability to the alliance.

Ahead of the visit, the Prime Minister has announced the UK will provide a package of winter kit to the Ukrainian Armed Forces to assist as they defend their country in gruelling winter conditions. NATO allies have been at the forefront of global support for Ukraine, after Russia’s invasion permanently shifted the dial on both Euro-Atlantic security and global relations.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said:

NATO is the cornerstone of our security, and the security of our allies. As the war in Ukraine continues to rage, we must not take peace at home for granted.

I am determined the UK will be the bedrock of NATO for generations to come. But in order to face the challenges future we must evolve as an Alliance to meet, and remain ahead of, the threat from our adversaries.

We must also continue backing the Ukrainian people in their resistance to Putin’s brutality. I’m pleased that UK-donated kit will be keeping the Ukrainian Armed Forces warm and safe as they face a perilous winter fighting for their country.

The Secretary General will arrive at Downing Street after visiting Ukrainian troops at Lydd Army Camp as part of Operation Interflex – the training programme for the Ukrainian Armed Forces pioneered by the UK. The recruits are being put through their paces by UK military trainers, ensuring they are front-line-ready as the Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to push back Russian invaders.

The Secretary General’s visit comes as the Prime Minister announces that the UK will send a further 12,000 sleeping kits and 150 heated tents to help Ukrainian troops fight through the winter.

The UK is set to deliver more than 25,000 sets of extreme cold weather clothing by mid-December, ensuring troops are able to operate and survive the plunging temperatures in Ukraine.

The extreme cold weather kits are in addition to more than 7,000 sets of normal cold weather kit distributed to recruits on Operation Interflex.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said:

With winter fast approaching, this equipment will ensure that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are able to operate effectively through the next few months. Alongside our training programme and the provision of lethal aid, it demonstrates our commitment to making sure that the basic Ukrainian soldier is well trained, well equipped and given the best possible chance to fight and determine their own future."

Prime Minister David Cameron announced last night at The Afghanistan Mining, Oil and Gas Investor Forum, held at No. 10 Downing Street, which showcased Afghanistan’s natural resource potential to global investors.

The Prime Minister set out details of new UK support to Afghanistan’s Minister of Mines, Wahidullah Shahrani, along with over 100 representatives from the extractives, business, diplomatic and academic sectors.

Afghanistan’s mineral and hydrocarbon resources will be crucial to the development of the country’s economy, which in turn will help to create jobs, reduce aid dependence, and secure a prosperous future for the Afghan people.

The new support includes:

A new £10 million DFID programme over the next three years, to support the Ministry of Mines’ work to negotiate, let, manage and monitor contracts, appoint experts to key posts and develop the mineral and hydrocarbon sector; 
a UKTI dedicated expert, based in Dubai, who will play a key role in supporting investment opportunities in Afghanistan by UK listed companies or those based in or otherwise linked to the UK; and 
the continued support of an International Investment Adviser who is currently helping Afghanistan’s Ministry of Mines develop international business relationships and market resources.
Speaking at the Forum, Prime Minister David Cameron said: “The real long-term answer for Afghanistan is prosperity and growth, jobs and investment and wealth. The scale of the opportunity in terms of the extractive industries is absolutely immense. This is an enormous opportunity which, if it can be got right, can be an extraordinary blessing and genuinely transformative.

“In Afghanistan, we are on the brink of getting this right, of having far more transparency, far more honesty in how we deal with the extractive industries. It is a theme of my G8 presidency this year to make sure that we push that agenda as far and as fast as we can.”

His Excellency Wahidullah Shahrani, Afghanistan’s Minister of Mines said:

“Afghanistan is a vast mineral rich country but one that is essentially under-explored and we are committed to developing our resources for the mutual benefit of the people of Afghanistan and quality resource companies prepared to meet the challenge. Developing Afghanistan’s considerable untapped natural resources is a task of the utmost importance. This work will continue to play a vital part in the overall recovery of our country for many years to come.

“Natural resource development is a key strand in Afghanistan’s return to prosperity. As such we are offering a unique opportunity, not only to enjoy an attractive return on investment, but also to play an important part in rebuilding our economy and rebuilding the quality of life of our people.”"

The network includes private businesses and specialist aid organisations who will rapidly deliver emergency medical, water and sanitation assistance to affected people. The British Government will also help set up emergency water and sanitation activities nationally, reaching nearly two million people, including women, children and the most vulnerable. The UK will also provide direct treatment for to up to 4,500 people affected by cholera.

The UK will ship anti-cholera drugs and water purification kits directly for use by those fighting the epidemic.

The UK, through the Department for International Development (DFID), will enable aid organisations and business members of the Rapid Response Facility (RRF) to mount a British response. This will involve:

Six aid organisations are being mobilised as part of the RRF: Save the Children, International Rescue Committee, Oxfam, Concern, Care International and the British Red Cross.

DFID has also been working closely with private sector partners and expects them to supply the majority of the aid organisations’ relief supplies and logistics in the coming days.

Andrew Mitchell said:

“The cholera epidemic in Sierra Leone is fast becoming a crisis, with millions potentially at risk. The UK is - for the first time - activating the Rapid Response Facility, its network of private sector and aid experts to make sure we get aid to where it is needed, fast.

“Not only will our response be rapid, it will be efficient. We will monitor closely to make sure every penny of British aid achieves results and supports those in dire need. Urgent action is required to halt the spread of disease and save lives - Britain is leading the way.”

Cholera has spread quickly across West Africa, getting significantly worse in the last few weeks, with almost half those infected in Sierra Leone - the worst epidemic in the country for two decades. Estimates so far are that 200 people have died, with more than 12,000 cases being reported and millions more are at risk, unless the international community takes quick action. The outbreak has been most severe in the capital, Freetown, which has a dangerous mix of poor sanitation, high population density and limited health services. A swift response is essential to bring the epidemic under control.

£2 million has been provided from the UK for the response. DFID are also bringing in a humanitarian expert to support coordination in Sierra Leone, to ensure a rapid response to cholera in Sierra Leone and value for money for UK taxpayers.

Secretary of State for International Development, Andrew Mitchell, established the Rapid Response Facility (RRF) in March. The RRF enables The UK Government to commit to rapid humanitarian funding for pre-qualified partners. Responding swiftly in humanitarian disasters ensures that more lives are saved and suffering reduced."

Businesses in England required to close due to local lockdowns or targeted restrictions will now be able to receive grants worth up to £1,500 every three weeks, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay told MPs today.
To be eligible for the grant, a business must have been required to close due to local Covid 19 restrictions. The largest businesses will receive £1,500 every three weeks they are required to close. Smaller businesses will receive £1,000.

Payments are triggered by a national decision to close businesses in a high incidence area. Each payment will be made for a 3 week lockdown period. Each new 3 week lockdown period triggers an additional payment.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay said:

These grants provide businesses with a safety net as they temporarily close their doors to help save lives in their local areas.

As local economies eventually and carefully re-open after local interventions, our Plan for Jobs is there waiting to help businesses get back on their feet, protect jobs and thrive in the future.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma said:

No business should be punished for doing the right thing, which is why today’s package will offer additional breathing space for businesses that have had to temporarily close to control the virus.

Through our wider Plan for Jobs, we will continue to back our innovators and job creators across the country who are playing a critical role as we build back better from the pandemic.

Responding to the announcement, The Federation of Small Businesses’ (FSB) National Chairman Mike Cherry said:

Though a lot of firms have now been able to reopen, thousands are still impacted by local lockdowns.

That’s why this intervention is so critical - throwing a much needed additional financial lifeline to those most harmed.

We look forward to working together with local government to make sure there is a straightforward  process for all firms affected.

Speaking in the House of Commons, Barclay also reiterated the recent commitment to roll-out additional payments for people on low incomes who are required to self-isolate in areas with high levels of Covid-19.

Currently these payments are available in Blackburn with Darwen, Pendle, and Oldham as part of an ongoing trial scheme.

This targeted support is in addition to businesses eligibility for the government’s existing schemes of support to businesses which remain available to impacted companies. This includes the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which has supported the wages of 9.6 million people so far, government backed loans and business grants worth up to £25,000 per property.

This help will also support local jobs dependent on impacted businesses, complementing the Chancellor’s Plan for Jobs.

Other measures announced to protect, support and create jobs include the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, cutting VAT for tourism and hospitality by 15%, a £2 billion Kickstart Scheme, which has opened for applications, and an £8.8 billion investment in new infrastructure, decarbonisation and maintenance projects."

It also details how government will hold to account those companies who do not meet expectations, including a new monitoring and reporting framework as legislated for in the Environment Act which will significantly improve the ability of both Ofwat and the Environment Agency to take enforcement action where needed.

Views are sought from the public on the targets as part of a suite of measures to be considered for the final Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction Plan, which will be published in September.

The main measures under consultation are:

We are the first government to set out our expectation that that water companies must take steps to significantly reduce storm overflows. Today, we are setting specific targets to ensure that those storm overflows are used only in exceptional circumstances – delivering on our Environment Act and building on wider work on water quality.

Today’s consultation follows significant action to date on tackling the critical issue of storm overflows. The Strategic Policy Statement for Ofwat, in which the Government has for the first time set a clear expectation that the industry’s economic regulator should prioritise action by water companies to protect the environment, is now in force.

A raft of measures have also been brought forward in theEnvironment Act 2021to tackle sewage discharges, including the requirement for greater transparency from water companies on their storm overflow data, meaning there are now more protections in place for our water environment than ever before.

Between 2020 to 2025, water companies are investing £7.1 billion to protect and improve the environment. Of this, £3.1 billion is being invested specifically in storm overflow improvements. This includes £1.9 billion investment on the Thames Tideway Tunnel super sewer.

Water companies need to go further and faster in tackling the damage caused by storm overflows, so these targets aimed at drastically reducing the number of harmful discharges are a welcome development.

The Environment Agency will continue to work with government,  the water industry, the other regulators and the NGOs to ensure we have healthier sewers, cleaner rivers and a better environment for all.

Separating sewage from water people drink is one of the greatest public health triumphs of the last 200 years.

The discharge of raw sewage, including from storm overflows into waters used by the public, should be an exceptionally rare event and we need to take action to reduce it substantially.

The consultation is open from today for six weeks, until 12 May."

Two new books look at its role in research communication.,Department for International Development,21 August 2012,"Despite the rise in social media and the dawn of the digital age, radio still remains one of the most powerful communication tools in the 21st century. In nations where internet and electricity are limited it is the most pervasive medium for connecting isolated communities. It isstill the dominant mass-medium in Africa, reaching further than newspapers and television, both in terms of audience numbers and geographical reach. As such, it can be an invaluable tool in effective research communication. Harnessing this power to foster development is the subject of two books published one year apart.

People’s Radio: Communicating change across Africa, by Dr. Linje Manyozo, a lecturer in Media, Communication and Development at the LSE, explores the challenges and benefits presented by radio for development initiatives. Manyozo examines radio as a platform for linkage and exchange between policy makers, government bodies, communities and researchers.

Looking at different strategies, the book highlights the importance of integrating indigenous knowledge systems and local communication requirements into any radio for development initiative. Manyozo notes that for Africa“linguistic diversity is both a problem and strength.”He emphasises that to be effective, broadcasters must work alongside this diversity, using local language and concepts to communicate social change to their audiences.

Manyozo’s comments on working within varied linguistic and cultural landscapes echo those outlined in Birgitte Jallov’s book,Empowerment Radio: Voices Building a Community, published one year earlier. Jallov stresses the importance of giving voice to the individualism of different communities. Her book offers a step-by-step guide to designing and maintaining a successful community radio station as a means for facilitating social change.

Jallov discusses the potential benefits of linking radio with other forms of media such as internet and mobile phones. However, she argues thatfor part literate and marginalised communities “empowerment radio” is the most effective means of raising awarenessand stimulating participatory networks for social change and development.

People’s Radiofocuses in detail on different case studies taken from across the African continent whileEmpowerment Radiohighlights successful community radio projects around the world. Both commentaries, however, offer valuable insights and critique relevant to the wider global discourse on research and development communication.  Both explore how radio-based communication can work to facilitate participatory engagement in development policy formulation, and implementation, within the community. With experience in the field, the authors provide detailed insights into what works, and what doesn’t, in community radio.

WithDFIDsupported projects such as thePANOSprogrammeRelayaiming to establish better links between research communities and the media across southern Africa, eastern Africa and south Asia, the discourse on research communication and media governance is becoming ever more dynamic. Behind-the-scenes, informed perspectives from individuals such as Manyozo and Birgitte Jallov offer valuable reference points for expanding this dialogue. With practical advice, as well as informed analysis, the books provide tool kits for broadcasters, communicators and researchers on the ground, essential for those in Africa and beyond.

Almost one in three of the world’s poorest children cannot reach their full potential due to malnutrition. As the Olympics close, Prime Minister David Cameron and Vice President Michel Temer of Brazil will call on the world to take the action needed to transform the life chances of millions of children before the next Olympic Games in 2016.

A central part of London’s successful bid for the Games has been the legacy it will create for Britain - reinvigorating one of the poorest parts of the country and inspiring a whole generation of young people. We hope that this event on the closing day of the Games will mean that London 2012 also has a lasting legacy for millions more children around the world by improving their nutrition and giving them the opportunity to fulfil their potential too. A new global target to reduce the number of stunted children by 70 million by 2025 has been agreed by the World Health Assembly.



The spirit of the Olympics is about athletes from all over the word striving to achieve their potential. But for around 170 million children today, their potential will already be limited by the time they are two years old. Stunting, the result of a prolonged poor diet or infection in early childhood, affects growth and physical ability. Stunted children may do less well at school and go on to earn less. Intervening in the first 1,000 days from the start of pregnancy can stop poor nutrition leading to permanent damage.

A range of highly cost-effective direct actions can help ensure that children get the right nutrients their bodies need to develop (such as preventing and treating vitamin deficiency). Ensuring people get enough food, clean water, better sanitation and education for mothers and children are vital too.

Generating the political will and leadership to address malnutrition is an even greater challenge. Countries which have taken concerted action to reduce under-nutrition have shown remarkably fast rates of reduction. Brazil, Peru, Thailand and China are among these.

The UN Secretary General recently challenged us all to create a world free from stunting. A new global target to reduce the number of stunted children by 40% by 2025 has been agreed by the World Health Assembly. The Scaling up Nutrition (SUN) Movement, to which 28 countries have now signed up, is developing the framework for monitoring progress against stunting targets. The G8 ‘New Alliance on Food and Nutrition Security’ is committed to supporting SUN in the scale-up.

On 12 August, Prime Minister David Cameron and Vice President Michel Temer of Brazil will challenge global leaders to step up efforts to improve nutrition and reduce the rate of stunting among the world’s poorest children between now and the next Olympics in 2016.

The Global Hunger Event will help to strengthen these commitments by identifying pioneering new ways of working to tackle malnutrition and bringing in new champions to support the global movement."

The two paralympians who have both been affected by polio, joined other survivors and charity campaigners from across the UK to hand over a petition in support of the Global Poverty Project’sEnd of Polio campaign.

International Development Secretary, Justine Greening, said:

We have all been inspired by Paralympics GB this summer and it is great how they have teamed up with Global Poverty Project and Rotary International to lend their support to such a worthy cause.

Parents in this country no longer have to worry that their children will contract polio, which was eradicated in Britain many years ago. We are now on the verge of eradicating it across the world. Thanks to the UK’s doubling of support, we helped to vaccinate 45 million children and halve the number of polio cases recorded last year.?

It is vitally important other donors join us to support these global efforts and protect those who are still vulnerable.

Ending polio

Polio was eradicated in the UK in the 1980’s and in the last 20 years, polio cases have fallen by 99% and the disease is now close to being only the second in history - after smallpox - to be wiped out.

At the end of last yearIndia celebrated a whole year free of any new cases of polio, however the situation remains endemic in Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan. Current progress in eliminating the disease is threatened by a funding shortfall of almost US $1 billion for 2012/13.

The Paralympians met with the Secretary of State to thank the Government for leading the way in supporting the eradication of polio around the world. They handed over a petition to encourage the Government to continue their commitment to fighting this preventable disease which still disables children for life and according to reports, costs the global economy up to $50 billion.

Elisha London, Global Poverty Project UK Country Director said:

Thanks to the UK Government’s past commitment to global polio eradication, millions of children around the world have been vaccinated against this debilitating and life threatening disease.

As Parliament resumes, it is imperative that the UK government remains focused on the goal to create a world that is polio free.

In January 2011,the Prime Minister announced a doubling of the UK support to the Global Polio Eradication Initiativeduring 2011 and 2012. He challenged others to match our extra funding and improve routine immunisation coverage. British support helped fully immunise over 45 million children and leveraged a further £100 million.

The fund comes as part of a new collaborative initiative to strengthen research capacity in Africa. TheRoyal Society-DFID Africa Capacity Building Initiativehas been set up to address the current skills gaps within higher education in Africa.

The Royal Society outline the following aims within theirexecutive summary:

Alongside other new initiatives such asDevelopment Research Uptake in Sub-Saharan Africa(DRUSSA),the Royal Society-DFID Africa Capacity Building Initiativeis attempting to reinvigorate the higher education sector within Africa; a sector which up until the millennium was often bypassed by international research in favour of basic education.

While there is a large undergraduate population in African universities, there is still a relatively small number of postgraduate students. By gathering baseline data from higher education institutes the initiative hopes that the development of successful research consortia will improve retention of well trained staff and in turn encourage a new generation of PhD applicants. As part of this, the initiative aims to support a cohort of postgraduate students with the aim of providing fresh candidates within an ageing sector.

The Royal Society have identified that while investments into health and agriculture have been very successful there are still key areas where the potential for African led research is not being achieved.  In an attempt to correct this imbalance, the fund for African research, recently announced, while supporting the establishment of research consortia, will offer specific funding for research projects focused on sanitation, water, soil and renewable energy. Larger grants will only be awarded to a consortium which incorporates one UK laboratory and three African laboratories.

Applications for this fund will open in November 2012.For further information on the Capacity Building Initiative thelogical frameworkof the programme is available online."

The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) will be at the forefront of delivering these plans, overseeing pay rises for millions working families, creating thousands of jobs and securing the UK’s status as a global science superpower.

The Budget complements theNet Zero StrategywhichBEISpublished last week and delivers the investment and support which UK firms need to plan for the future.

Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said:

One year ago, this country was in the grip of the biggest recession in 300 years. Thanks  to the action we have taken, the UK is recovering faster than our major competitors, more people are in work, and growth is up.

The Budget this week invests in a more innovative, high-skill economy, backs business, helps working families with the cost of living – and levels up every part of the United Kingdom. It is a Budget which provides the foundations for a stronger economy.

We’re leading the UK’s efforts to cut pollution, cement our status as a science superpower, and support business as they create the well-paid, highly-skilled jobs of the future.

As we continue to recover from the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the Spending Review includes key measures to put pounds in the pockets of British workers and support businesses looking to invest and grow. These include:

The UK is a world leader in science and innovation, and this year’s Spending Review includes commitments which will cement our status as a science superpower. These include:

Established in 1936, The Wellcome Trust is a global charitable foundation dedicated to“achieving extraordinary improvements in human and animal health”and remains one of the UK’s largest non-governmental source of funds for biomedical research.

Wellcome Trust Director, Sir Mark Walport,states that“research isn’t finished until it’s been published, and by publishing the work that we fund in open access formats it means that as many people as possible are able to have access to the literature without any hindrance at all, and that of course will ultimately maximize the value and the impact of the research that we fund.”

By distributing research papers for free through the web, the Wellcome Trust hopes to effectively maximize their reach so they can be read and built upon, which will in turn foster a“richer research culture”.

The issue of the cost of academic journals has been rife in the media this week. Anarticle in The Guardian, has criticised the way academics are cornered into playing the journal-centric career-building game, reporting that“Some very clever people have put up with a very silly system for far too long… the old order needs to change, not just for the good of academics, but for the good of the public who pay them.”

Frustrations about the current journal system have already prompted a boycott of Elsevier, the world’s biggest publisher in this field. OnThe Cost of Knowledge, a website set up as a focus for the protest, over 9,400 researchers say they will no longer submit or act as peer reviewers for Elsevier.

But while many scientists and researchers are in favour of open access, it may take some time for the idea to become the standard model for scientific publishing. The Wellcome Trust hopes that their stance will prove to be a step in the right direction."

Adults without an A-Level or equivalent qualification will be offered a free, fully-funded college course – providing them with skills valued by employers, and the opportunity to study at a time and location that suits them.

This offer will be available from April in England, and will be paid for through the National Skills Fund. A full list of available courses will be set out shortly.

Higher education loans will also be made more flexible, allowing adults and young people to space out their study across their lifetimes, take more high-quality vocational courses in further education colleges and universities, and to support people to retrain for jobs of the future.

These reforms will be backed by continued investment in college buildings and facilities – including over £1.5 billion in capital funding. More details will be set out in a further education white paper later this year.

The coronavirus pandemic and changing economy is why the Prime Minister is developing a long-term plan to ensure that, as work changes, people can retrain, upskill and find new well-paid jobs.

In a speech on Tuesday, the Prime Minister is expected to announce a new Lifetime Skill Guarantee. He will say:

As the Chancellor has said, we cannot, alas, save every job. What we can do is give people the skills to find and create new and better jobs.

So my message today is that at every stage of your life, this government will help you get the skills you need.

He will add:

We’re transforming the foundations of the skills system so that everyone has the chance to train and retrain.

Apprenticeship opportunities will also be increased, with more funding for SMEs taking on apprentices, and greater flexibility in how their training is structured – especially in sectors such as construction and creative industries where there are more varied employment patterns.

In 2000, over 100,000 people were doing Higher National Certificates and Diplomas, but that has reduced to fewer than 35,000 now. Those doing foundation degrees has declined from 81,000 to 30,000.

As a result, only 10% of adults hold a Higher Technical Qualification as their highest qualification, compared to 20% in Germany and 34% in Canada.

This is despite the fact that five years after completion, the average Higher Technical Apprentice earns more than the average graduate.

That is why the government is committed to making higher education more flexible to facilitate lifelong learning, and to make it easy for adults and young people to break up their study into segments, transfer credits between colleges and universities, and enable more part-time study.

This new arrangement will provide finance for shorter term studies, rather than having to study in one three or four year block.

The government is also committing £8 million for digital skills boot camps; expanding successful pilots in Greater Manchester and the West Midlands and introducing programmes in four new locations.

From next year, boot camps will be extended to sectors like construction and engineering, helping the country build back better and support our refreshed Industrial Strategy.

Earlier this year the government launched its free online Skills Toolkit, helping people train in digital and numeracy skills. This is being expanded today to include 62 additional courses.

£2.5 billion is also being made available through the National Skills Fund to help get people working again after COVID, as well as giving those in work the chance to train for higher-skilled, better-paid jobs.

BT welcomes the Prime Minister’s commitment to put skills at the heart of the COVID-19 recovery plan, and particularly the emphasis on digital skills.  BT is already heavily invested in this area through Skills for Tomorrow which aims to empower 10 million people by giving them the skills they need to make the most of life in a digital world. Our Work Ready programme, and our support for the new Fast Futures digital courses for young adults, focus on the jobseeker groups that most need new skills. Ensuring that the nation’s workforce is ready for a digital future has never been more urgent – and partnership is key. That’s why BT is a founding partner of FutureDotNow, a coalition which aims to motivate people and businesses across the UK to address the growing skills gap and empower everyone to thrive in a digital UK.

We welcome this initiative to help the country recover from the impact of the pandemic by equipping people with the skills needed to find new jobs and retrain for new opportunities. At Amazon, we continue to provide opportunities for people of all ages to gain new skills with apprenticeships and university bursaries, free computer science and engineering resources through our Amazon Future Engineer and Maths4All programmes, and free training for small businesses through the Amazon Small Business Accelerator. Amazon also offers employees a programme called Career Choice that provides funding for skills development through nationally recognised courses of up to £8,000 over four years.

Given the pace of change in business and in workplaces today, and the economic challenges of COVID, we welcome the Prime Minister’s announcements today to not just rebuild, but to turbo charge skills training in England. The new Skills and Productivity Board has a key role to play in developing our skills economy for current and future generations. It is a privilege to contribute, and I’m looking forward to working with the panel and the government to drive this important agenda. The Skills Productivity Board will provide important advice to government on how to tackle the nation’s skills challenges to help rebuild our economy post-COVID-19 and deliver the bold skills agenda outlined by the Prime Minister today. I look forward to working with government to level up opportunity across the country ensuring people have the skills they need to progress.

As a country we face multiple challenges, but we believe that learning unlocks opportunity. Today, more than ever, individuals, businesses and government must build the skills we need for tomorrow. Because if we fail to act now, the UK could easily be left behind in the global economy. There are no better investments in our future than the kinds of accessible, lifelong and flexible programmes that the Prime Minister has announced this morning.

It’s more important than ever that government and industry work together to help young people and adults gain the skills needed to work in sectors which will support our nation’s economic recovery. As a major employer of graduates and apprentices, BAE Systems’ investment in skills provides an essential pipeline of talent that enables us to continue to deliver cutting-edge defence and security capabilities, essential to our national security.

We welcome the Prime Minister’s announcement of increased funding for skills and further education. As a business we are passionate about improving social mobility and developing the skills of the nation’s young people to ensure they are ready for work. That is why we invest heavily in apprenticeships, supporting over 12,500 since 2011.

With digitisation accelerating throughout the economy, the UK needs to continue to develop a highly skilled and innovative workforce. Banks can play a critical role, and Citi looks forward to expanding the reach of its current apprenticeship programmes, including our recently-launched Data Academy and efforts to encourage former employees back into the workforce. Citi stands ready to play its part in delivering on the UK Government’s ambition to increase employability and transform the country’s training and skills system.

The Prime Minister’s announcement today to transform the training and skills system is crucial to helping businesses get back on their feet and start to realise future opportunities. These are tough times for small businesses and skills are a vital part of the recovery process.

The Co-op Group is pleased to work in partnership with the government to create opportunities for adults to gain the skills they need to move into sustainable employment. We are already an industry leader in providing apprenticeships and we are proud of the work our 1,200 current apprentices have done as key workers during the pandemic to support the nation.

We believe that opportunities need to be created where they are most needed and offered to those who most need them. So we have already committed to ensure that groups that have previously been under-represented in our apprenticeship programme receive fair access in the future so we are seeking partnerships focussed on benefitting Black, Asian and ethnic minority candidates. We also know there is more to do to ensure opportunities to develop new skills are made available in the communities that most need them. That’s why we have committed to offer up to 150 kickstarter placements – combining skills and paid employment - in communities where we know the need is greatest.

We welcome today’s announcement by the Prime Minister. As future technologies increase the need for digital and electrical skills in the automotive industry, Jaguar Land Rover supports any measures aimed at up-skilling and re-skilling our employees as a part of a lifelong approach to learning.

As the largest UK automotive apprenticeship provider, we invest heavily in the training and development of our people throughout their careers. We look forward now to working with government and industry to develop fit for purpose technical courses and qualifications to support future high value job creation and maintain the UK’s global manufacturing competitiveness."

This follows public consultations which ran from 9 February to 2 March on designating the sites, which are popular swimming and paddling spots for both local residents and visitors to the area.

The new status means that the Environment Agency will regularly take samples from the sites to assess the level of water quality and whether action is needed to cut bacteria levels. Monitoring will begin at both sites from May 15, the beginning of the bathing water season. Results of water quality testing will be used to classify the bathing waters in the autumn.

Environment Minister Rebecca Pow said:

The residents of Oxford and the Isle of Wight have shown their overwhelming approval for these sites as places to enjoy and connect with nature, so I am pleased to see these locations receiving designated bathing water status. While bathing water quality has improved in recent years and England now has the cleanest bathing waters since records began, we know that water quality at these sites won’t change overnight. It will take time and all those with a role to play must commit to achieve the necessary improvements.

We are continuing to drive up the quality of lakes, rivers and seas for the public to enjoy through the measures in our Environment Act, and I would encourage more applications for popular bathing areas, both inland and coastal, that may also be suitable for designation.

The Environment Agency has been monitoring and driving improvements at coastal and inland bathing waters since the 1990s, and in this time there have been significant improvements to water quality. In 2021, 99 per cent of England’s bathing waters met the minimum bathing water standard and of these, 95 per cent met the highest standard of Excellent or Good. This compares with 98.3% passing the minimum required standards in 2019 and is the highest number since new standards were introduced in 2015.

Responses to the consultations were received from a wide of range of interested parties across the country, including residents, NGOs and conservation groups.

In total there were 1,267 responses to theWolvercote Mill Stream consultation, the largest response to date for a proposed bathing water designation, with 1,260 of respondents in favour of making the site a designated bathing water area.

TheEast Cowes Esplanade consultationreceived 132 responses, with 131 of respondents supporting the proposed designation.

Today’s announcement followsnew plans unveiled by the Government in March to tackle the number of discharges of untreated sewage from storm overflows by water companies, including discharges into bathing waters. Under the proposed plan, there will be over 70% fewer discharges close to bathing waters by 2035 during the bathing season, with significant reductions expected outside the bathing season as well.

In a call with business leaders the Prime Minister and Michael Gove will discuss preparations and ask businesses to step up their efforts to get ready for the changes and opportunities in just over 8 weeks.

The call to action comes as the government launches the latest phase of its public information campaign emphasising the increased urgency to prepare for the end of the UK transition period with the strapline “Time is running out”.

HMRC are today also writing to 200,000 traders who trade with the EU to set out the new customs and tax rules coming into place and how to deal with them.

This follows a clear direction from the Prime Minister that the whole UK must prepare to leave the EU on Australia-style terms based on simple principles of global free trade, after the European Council conclusions last week left us without a basis to continue trade negotiations if there was no fundamental change in the EU’s negotiating position.

The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said:

At the end of this year we are leaving the EU Single Market and Customs Union and this means there are both new challenges and new opportunities for businesses. Make no mistake, there are changes coming in just 75 days and time is running out for businesses to act.

It is on all of us to put in the work now so that we can embrace the new opportunities available to an independent trading nation with control of its own borders, territorial waters and laws.

The government is also redoubling its own efforts to get ready for the end of the year with Michael Gove ordering the XO Cabinet Committee to convene five times per week as of today. He will chair the 150th meeting of the operations committee in COBR next week.

The government has already published the Border Operating Model which gives traders the clarity they need to prepare for new rules, announced £705m of investment in jobs, infrastructure and technology at the border, and provided £84m in grants to grow the customs intermediary sector.

Recognising the impact of coronavirus on businesses’ ability to prepare the UK has also taken the decision to introduce new border controls in three stages up until 1 July 2021. However, the focus of the XO committee is now firmly on making sure businesses are ready for the changes and opportunities ahead.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma said:

With just 75 days until the end of the transition period, businesses must act now to ensure they are ready for the UK’s new start as an independent trading nation once more. There will be no extension to the transition period, so there is no time to waste.

There will be a guaranteed set of changes for which businesses need to prepare for, so I urge all businesses across the country to checkgov.uk/transitionto see what action they need to take.

Businesses have a crucial role to play in ensuring a smooth transition, and the Government will be there to support them through this change every step of the way.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/commandos-descend-on-tower-of-london,News story,Commandos descend on Tower of London,Royal Marines descended on the Tower of London this week to launch a major fundraising campaign for serving and retired Royal Marines and their families.,Ministry of Defence,15 October 2010,"In an impressive display, Commandos abseiled from a Lynx helicopter onto the Tower to kick start theRoyal Marines Charitable Trust Fund (RMCTF)Campaign - a four-year drive to raise £6m by the 350th anniversary of the Corps in 2014.

The start of the event was signalled by the Royal Marines Band, followed by a briefing from Major General Buster Howes, Commandant General Royal Marines, and Brigadier Simon Hill, Chairman of the RMCTF Campaign Board, on the aims of the campaign.

Serving and former Royal Marines were also on hand to watch the impressive abseiling display which followed, including former Royal Marine and TV presenter Monty Halls, members of the fundraising board, and representatives of Hasler Company, the unit which manages the recovery of wounded and injured Royal Marines.

Brigadier Hill said:

The RMCTF has among the widest purposes of any Service charity, in that it looks after both serving and retired Royal Marines and their dependants. It goes without saying that it seeks to support the wounded and injured, but it also tries to improve the quality of life of those still serving and facing multiple deployments in high threat environments.

It also provides through-life support to those who have left the Corps or have lost loved ones in service.

At the heart of this campaign is the unique spirit and feeling of family shared by all Royal Marines. It’s this spirit that drives them on, helps them conquer all obstacles and sets them apart.

The campaign to raise £6m seeks to harness the energy and goodwill of the 125,000 members of the Royal Marines family and their friends. Large parts of that Corps family are already hard at work and various major events and challenges run by them will help to raise the target amount.

Examples include the Commando Spirit Series of challenge events based on Royal Marines tests; the community-level effort led by the 90 Royal Marines Association branches worldwide and the RMCTF ‘Help Our Wounded’ Facebook page; and ‘The C Group’, which seeks to harness the business community in support of the Royal Marines, especially in mentoring and supporting those leaving the Service due to wounds or injury.

The serving Corps is also playing its part in raising funds, but with 75 per cent of Royal Marines to be operationally deployed over the next 18 months, the RMCTF is encouraging the wider Corps family and the general public to get behind the campaign."

Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology, Peter Luff, said:

This is another important achievement for the Type 45 project. Sea Viper is one of the most advanced weapons systems in the world and this capability, combined with the might and speed of the Type 45 destroyer, will provide the Royal Navy with a fearsome fighting force with unparalleled protection from air attacks.

Sea Viper is one of the most sophisticated weapon systems to date and is capable of defending the new battleships, and other vessels sailing with them, against missiles approaching from any direction and at supersonic speeds, representing a huge leap in capability for the Royal Navy.

Captain Guy Robinson, Commanding Officer of HMS Daring, said:

This Sea Viper firing is a significant milestone for us and the final piece in the jigsaw as we prepare for our first deployment. I am very pleased with the test and how my team conducted themselves during this very complex procedure.

The successful firing comes as the MOD announces that support for the Sea Viper weapon system has been secured for the next six years.

The £165m contract has been awarded to MBDA UK, who are based in Bristol and Stevenage, to provide technical assistance for the Sea Viper missile systems on the six destroyers that will be based at Portsmouth Naval Base.

Bernard Gray, Chief of Defence Materiel for MOD Defence Equipment and Support, said:

Securing support to the Sea Viper missile system is an essential element in ensuring that the Royal Navy’s new destroyers are always ready to undertake their role in defending Britain’s interests wherever that may be.

In further progress to the Type 45 programme, HMS Diamond was formally commissioned into the Royal Navy on 6 May 2011, Dragon is undertaking her second set of sea trials and HMS Dauntless has completed her basic operational sea training."

The reorganisation sees responsibility for delivering outputs split across the existing Single Service Chiefs of Materiel, and a new fourth post, a civilian Chief of Materiel (Joint Enablers). The post of Director General Resources, who acts as the Finance Director of DE&S, was also created.

The changes allow DE&S to give greater support to the teams delivering projects and provide a much stronger focus on financial management.

Describing DE&S as ‘the most efficient and effective defence acquisition organisation in the world’, Dr Tyler said:

I leave with a great sense of sadness mixed with huge pride at what we have achieved.

The transformation in equipment support to Afghanistan stands out as a crowning achievement for its sheer importance. Close behind it is the major improvements in our management of complex projects and the culture of realism and honesty that has supported that improvement.

Pete Worrall, currently Director Helicopters, will be taking over Dr Tyler’s duties until a permanent appointment is made.

Mr Worrall said:

It has been a privilege to work for Andrew. I have greatly valued his sage advice and the intellect he has brought to some challenging acquisition problems and I wish him all the very best as he returns to the private sector.

I was delighted to be asked to take over as COM JE on a temporary basis while the post is competed and relish the opportunity to work with the Main Board, DE&S staff and our stakeholders in the delivery of the Joint Enablers portfolio."

The operation has also seen HMS Daring put her command abilities to the test for the first time as she hosted the Australian and New Zealand Navy personnel who are currently directing the at-sea activities of Combined Task Force (CTF) 150, to which the Type 45 belongs on her east of Suez mission.

For as well as being able to shoot down incoming missiles travelling at three times the speed of sound, the Portsmouth-based warship has specially-built command facilities, including a dedicated planning room, from where the movements and actions of a task group can be directed.

In addition to the CTF 150 command team, Daring - on her maiden deployment - also embarked Yemeni observers, whose contribution proved extremely valuable, providing expertise and in-depth knowledge of the region to the ships involved as the group moved around the area of operations.

The Task Force also enjoyed the support of tanker RFA Wave Knight, which kept the ships supplied with fuel and stores and also contributed her Lynx helicopter.

Daring’s Petty Officer, Lee Butler, said:

Seeing all of the different nations working together aboard Daring was very encouraging. The in-depth knowledge provided by the Yemenis has also been particularly useful.

Captain Lance Cook, Royal New Zealand Navy, Chief of Staff of the embarked command team from CTF 150, explained that the operation is significant as more than 23,000 vessels a year pass through the waters patrolled during SCIMITAR ANZAC.

His Task Force’s key mission is to stamp out illicit activity - piracy, smuggling, people-trafficking - and safeguard mariners going about their lawful business, thus maintaining stability in the region."

Lieutenant Colonel Ian Mortimer, Commanding Officer of The Queen’s Royal Hussars Battle Group, officially transferred command of the base to Lieutenant Colonel Abdullah Karem Khan, commanding officer of the Kandak, during a short ribbon-cutting ceremony.

The fully air-conditioned and comfortable accommodation is far superior to that which the warriors usually live in and will provide security to the Lashkar Gah district and to the vital Route 601 in the area.

The $1.35m (roughly £850,000) project was funded by the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), and Brigadier General Sherin Shah, the Commander of 3/215 Brigade, praised the new base and emphasised his gratitude towards the ISAF for providing it.

The project was managed by the Military Stabilisation Support Team led by Warrant Officer Class 1 Jason Tether, who said:

This is a fantastic success story, and an asset that will prove highly beneficial to the ANA to provide security for Lashkar Gah district and the Route 601 that runs through here.

The most recent exercise saw Blyth use both her ship’s divers and the advanced Seafox mine disposal system to detect drill mines laid in her area of operations. At the same time the task group vessels had to respond to simulated attacks by small boats, fast jets and helicopters.

Commanding Officer of HMS Blyth, Commander Tim Davey, said:

The exercise saw Blyth prove her capability in mine detection and disposal as well as training the ship’s force protection teams against a variety of realistic simulated threats. Working closely with the Turkish Navy, the exercise provided us with a great opportunity to train my team and maintain our core skills.

Helping to assist HMS Blyth in her role as command platform are two NATO staff officers from the Greek and Turkish navies who are embarked on board the ship, working closely with the crew to support the planning and execution of the ship’s tasking.

The exercise is the latest challenge in a demanding deployment for the sophisticated minehunter. Before arriving in Turkish waters she found herself at the centre of a major salvage exercise in the Aegean Sea. Involving a simulated fire and flood on board, the scenario was designed to draw resources and personnel from other task group ships and test their responses:

The assistance at sea exercise was a great opportunity for the four vessels in the task group to work together in a high-pressure situation,

said Lieutenant Commander Charlie Noonan, Blyth’s Executive Officer, who co-ordinates the response in the event of an on board emergency.

In the end, the response from all the teams was excellent and it proved the close bonding and high levels of co-operation that exist among the sailors.

The emergency exercise finished with a German firefighting team re-entering a smoke-filled compartment, a Turkish first aid team dealing with simulated casualties, and an Italian damage control team conducting dummy repairs to ‘flooded’ compartments.

The crew of HMS Blyth are now looking forward to three weeks of maritime security operations in the eastern Mediterranean before saying farewell to their NATO colleagues and embarking on the 3,000-mile (4,800km) journey home to Scotland in early December.

During her time with the task group, Blyth has successfully conducted multiple exercises and training all over the Mediterranean, including important maritime security operations and a minehunting exercise in the Black Sea:

The deployment has been both challenging and highly rewarding,

commented Lieutenant Hamish Maxwell, HMS Blyth’s Navigating Officer.

Since arriving in the region in early July, the crew has done an excellent job and, although we will miss our NATO friends, it is a good feeling to be approaching the end of our tour. We are looking forward to the return trip back to the UK with fingers crossed for good weather in the Bay of Biscay."

The fourteen veterans of the Battle of Britain onboard the Airbus flew over the parts of England and the English Channel which saw some of the fiercest aerial combats of the war and were accompanied by 15 widows of Battle of Britain pilots.

The battle for air supremacy between the RAF and the Luftwaffe in 1940 was a decisive chapter in World War Two. The daily dogfights in the skies of southern England saved Britain from German invasion.

Bill Bond MBE, founder of the Battle of Britain Historical Society, which organised Saturday’s two-hour flight, said he had wanted to mark the 70th anniversary of the battle with ‘something a bit special’. He said:

The Spitfire and Hurricane are magnificent aircraft and for most of the veterans this was the first time they had been airborne with either fighter since the Second World War. We must never forget their selflessness and valour in what was a fundamental turning point in the war.

Spitfire pilot Flight Lieutenant William Walker, the eldest veteran onboard at 97, said:

It was a marvellous sight to see a Hurricane and Spitfire flying, the sun glinting on them above the clouds. The Spitfire is the most exciting plane to see. I would love to fly one again.

Based at an air base in Surrey during the Battle of Britain, Flight Lieutenant Walker was often sent up two or three times a day. It was on one of these missions in 1940 that he came under attack by a Messerschmitt 109, the main German fighter plane, and was shot down over the English Channel:

My leader was shot down and badly burnt, my number two was killed and I got a bullet in my leg and my plane was shot to pieces. I bailed out at 20,000ft [6,000m],” he recalled.

After landing in the water he was rescued by a fishing boat and taken to Ramsgate, where he was met by a crowd:

They cheered as I came ashore and a dear old lady gave me a cup of tea,” he said.

Suffering from hypothermia, he was taken to hospital where he underwent an operation to remove a bullet from his ankle. When he woke up, a doctor was by his side holding the bullet:

He gave it to me and I still have it as a treasured possession,” he added.

Secretary of State for Defence Dr Liam Fox, who joined the veterans on the flight, said:

It is almost impossible to measure our debt to those who fought in the Battle of Britain and who defended all we hold dear against the evil of Naziism. It is an honour to board this flight with some of those who won us that famous victory.

This is a very special year of celebrating the Battle of Britain and I urge the public to attend one of the many commemorative events occurring throughout August and September to offer their own personal thanks for the sacrifices made in our name in 1940.

The veterans were also joined on the memorial flight by South African High Commissioner Dr Zola Skweyiya, Belgian Diplomatic Counsellor Pascal Gregoire, actor Edward Fox, and Battle of Britain Historical Society supporter Bamber Gascoigne."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-anti-laser-eyewear-for-pilots-tested,News story,New anti-laser eyewear for pilots tested,A new type of laser eye protection (LEP) for pilots is being tested by the Ministry of Defence.,Ministry of Defence,12 October 2012,"The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) has been working with Defence Equipment and Support (DE&S) to evaluate and assess the specially designed spectacles.

The LEPs can filter out different wavelengths of light from the spectrum, including those used in various laser weapons and laser pens, which are becoming increasingly available from the internet.

Dr Craig Williamson, Principal Scientist atDstl, explained the rationale behind the project work:

There are an increasing number of incidents of inexpensive lasers being used to distract pilots, so we have been researching advanced technologies to mitigate this hazardous and potentially lethal distraction,” he said.

The prototype spectacles can filter out a range of different laser wavelengths, allowing greater operational benefits and flexibility for pilots [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]

Unlike conventionalLEP, which tends to filter out and block just one wavelength from the colour spectrum, the prototype spectacles, made by Glasgow-based company Thin Film Solutions, can filter out a range of different laser wavelengths, allowing greater operational benefits and flexibility for pilots.

This is achieved by a composite structure comprising a polycarbonate layer, made with a special absorbing optical dye, bonded to a thin glass lens with a special coating to reflect certain wavelengths.

The project work on theLEPis a good example of how funding fromDE&S’s equipment programme can be used to evaluate technology and assess it for potential benefits and uses.

Pete Douglass ofDE&Sexplained:

With funding from the equipment programme we were able to askDstlto evaluate this newLEPagainst older, more conventional filters in order to understand the development needs before they would be ready for service,” he said.

In the case of theLEP, the research highlighted some clear strengths, whilst also showing some weaknesses of the technology which we are now addressing with future research.

The work has also benefited from an established partnership betweenDstland the United States Air Force, with testing having taken place in May of this year.

Dr Williamson said:

The bilateral work at the United States Air Force Tri-Service Research Laboratory in San Antonio proved to be invaluable.

The results from this human performance testing on spatial detection and colour perception have set the benchmark for future work, and we’re hoping that further bilateral funding will be available to research the next generation of eye protection in the coming years.

Further testing is to be conducted later this year, including optical performance and environmental testing byDstl, and laser dazzle and performance testing at QinetiQ."

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/natural-solutions-for-tackling-health-inequalities-conference-report,News story,Natural solutions for tackling health inequalities: conference report,"The Institute of Health Equity (IHE) has published a report funded by Natural England, which highlights the growing evidence of the benefits of green spaces on health and wellbeing, and the differences in access to natural environments across England, which contribute to health inequalities.",Natural England,7 October 2014,"Thereporthas been published following last year’s ‘Natural solutions to tackling health inequalities’ conference, hosted by the nationaloutdoors for all working group. The conference attracted practitioners, academics and policy makers from over 70 organisations involved in health, diversity and environment at local and national levels.

The conference looked at evidence of the benefits of the natural environment to our health and, in particular, to those communities with the greatest need. It made some recommendations to improve inequalities that exist.

The report includes evidence that shows:

Duncan Selbie CEO of Public Health England, in his foreword to the report makes the point that: “Recognising the role of the natural environment as a primary determinant of health is, in many ways, the foundation of modern public health. Good health and wellbeing is not solely the absence of illness; the role of the environment we live in is hugely important in shaping our lives and, consequently, our health. So this report is a timely and very welcome contribution to increasing awareness of this amongst practitioners and policy makers, both in the health and environment sectors.”

Duncan concludes by saying: “So having access to high quality, local natural environments is critically important to promoting physical health and wellbeing in children and adults. Together, through this report, we have the opportunity to look afresh at what have hitherto appeared to be intractable public health challenges, and share our knowledge and experience of what works so that we can make a real difference to the quality of people’s lives.”

Dr Jessica Allen, Deputy Director at theIHE, University College London and lead author for the report, in summarising the evidence states: “Overall, better health is related to access to green space regardless of socio-economic status, and income-related inequality in health is moderated by exposure to green space. So, increasing the amount and quality of green space can be part of a low cost package to address health inequalities, improve health outcomes and deliver other benefits.”

Natural England’sMonitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE)survey also reveals that some social groups visit the natural environment far less frequently than the rest of the population. It is these groups that often suffer the greatest health inequality, and it is these groups that could benefit the most from increased access to the natural environment. Together these communities are a very significant proportion of the English population and their numbers are growing:

National outdoors for all working group members are now actively working with the health and environment sectors to help implement the report’s recommendations."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chief-of-the-defence-staff-gives-annual-speech,News story,Chief of the Defence Staff gives annual speech,"The single biggest strategic risk facing the UK today is economic rather than military, Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) General Sir David Richards said at his RUSI Annual Lecture this week.",Ministry of Defence,16 December 2011,"In his second annual lecture at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), General Richards said this had been a busy, challenging, but rewarding year for Defence. He began his speech by saying:

A thriving economy must be the central ingredient in any UK Grand Strategy. This is why the eurozone crisis is of such huge importance not just to the City of London but rightly to the whole country, and to military planners like me. Seen through my prism the world looks especially unpredictable and unstable.

General Richards drew attention to the issues that face not just the UK but NATO and the wider world. He spoke of ‘a hugely complex transition and withdrawal from Afghanistan, the destabilising effects of Iran’s nuclear ambitions in the Middle East’, and the risk that the ‘Arab Awakening could lead to fissures and internal conflict that could be exported around the world’.

The rise of China’s economy raised questions for NATO to think about he added, asking:

What impact will China’s need to keep its population content have on us? Equally what will the rise of the other emerging economies mean for us? Natural allies or hostile competitors?

Population growth, global warming, terrorism, piracy and international crime were just some of the problems to be faced in the near future, he said. But the General was clear that the role that the Armed Forces would play in ensuring the security of the Olympic Games would be done with huge pride.

Having identified the issues, General Richards asked the question ‘how do we respond to this unstable, unpredictable future?’

He pointed out that the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) had rebalanced British defence and security for the next decade, and that difficult decisions taken about capability still left the UK powerful relative to our allies:

We were the first to accept the implications of the global economy. We clearly won’t be the last. In global terms we spend the fourth largest amount on Defence.

All western nations, including the USA, are changing their defence structures, argued the General. He went on to say that, even though the UK may still have to prioritise even more ruthlessly now that there are fewer ships, men and planes, ‘we will still be, in comparative terms, a front rank player in the NATO Alliance which will remain the most powerful military pact the world has ever known’.

And, he reasoned, as the SDSR anticipated, alliances will be increasingly important:

As the world evolves, so new groupings will emerge. The most obvious is our alliance with the French. It is a vehicle for positive joint action.

He added that the UK will require other carefully chosen alliances over the coming decade and the collaboration with countries in the Gulf and Africa has delivered results in the region for surprisingly little cost, he argued.

General Richards went on to say that holding military capabilities at flexible levels of readiness was the key to defence planning and that the use of Reserves would help to allow this:

MOD and Single Services are working through the implications of all this,” he said.

The General spoke of the importance of putting an emphasis on education to adapt to new technologies. There would also be a need to be able to adopt tactics to fit the kit available rather than the kit on wish lists, he said.

Speaking about strategy, he said:

I know I am not alone in arguing that strategy matters. The Government’s National Security Council demonstrates clear intent while the Foreign Office has reinvigorated a post to oversee strategy, while in the MOD Lord Levene sanctioned the post of Deputy Chief of Defence Staff Military Strategy and Operations, properly supported by an Assistant Chief of Defence Staff Military Strategy.

At the National Security Council the [Prime Minister] chairs a debate with interested parties arguing properly for their perspective. The ability to have this discussion allows a clear understanding of what we in the military term ‘Commander’s Intent’. It is vital to have this common understanding of what is required or sought. It unifies our actions and allows subordinate commanders, or ministries, to test and adjust their sub-plans,” said General Richards.

The General said that we must remain vigilant in ensuring developing threats are recognised and balanced appropriately:

It is no good, for example, planning for a perfect force in, say 2030, if we cannot protect our vital interests in the interim.

Within the military strategic sphere CDS described the challenges that remain as considerable:

To succeed, we need to design mechanisms that oblige other nations to provide what is vital in a crisis and it won’t be easy.

There was, CDS said, a need for all nations to develop a more agile acquisition process that could quickly adapt to changing operational requirements:

To reassure you, this is top of the Secretary of State’s and his new Defence Board’s agenda.

I am sometimes asked if the professional military really can think and plan jointly and strategically. Well the Armed Forces Committee provides the Chiefs with the mechanism to do so and the opportunity to get out of perceived Single Service straight jackets. The Armed Forces Committee also prepares me for the Defence Board. Whilst this may change, I am currently the only military person on the new Board. The Committee allows me to understand the different perspectives of the Single Service Chiefs. It is my duty to record their views but then to give my own professional advice, which may not be based on a consensus.

General Richards described Afghanistan as Defence’s main effort and his greatest challenge:

The UK will be out of the combat role by the end of 2014. My key role over the next three years is to ensure that British forces leave in good order, enabling the decisive elements of an enduring campaign - those based on effective [Afghan National Security Forces], governance and development - to continue over the coming decades.

This is not a change of strategy but a change in ownership of that strategy. As it ‘transitions’ to Afghan leadership, the international community will remain four square behind the Afghan people, in our interests and theirs.

The Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) will shortly reach a total strength of 352,000, a headcount that the General jokingly said he envied:

Already, the ANSF are leading some 50 per cent of conventional and Special Forces missions and they have taken over lead security responsibility from ISAF forces for more than 25 per cent of the population. That will soon increase to 50 per cent. As this continues, the insurgency is reducing. Attacks in Afghanistan are down 28 per cent on last year.

General Richards said that the operation was on track and was supported by the population:

Of course the picture is not all rosy. Risks to the strategy remain.

But he said it was worth remembering, a few months on from 9/11’s 10th anniversary, that UK national security underpins what we are doing in Afghanistan:

Ten years ago I would have felt no need to mention it. It is interesting to note how quickly many outside government forget that the ungoverned, unstable space that was Afghanistan became everyone’s problem on 9/11 and the UK’s own homegrown 7/7 bombers were trained in Pakistan.

Many of the lessons we learnt in Afghanistan have since been applied to Libya. Operation ELLAMY was a cross-government operation in which the military protected the population to allow them to shape their own future.

At heart this operation was a success because of the constructive and synergistic role played by a number of nations, principally but not exclusively under NATO guidance and leadership. This was the SDSR’s emphasis on the importance of allies playing out in front of our eyes.

Our co-operation with the French could not have been closer, while our ability to use existing NATO structures allowed us to act quickly and effectively, avoiding confusion. The role played by the United States of America was fundamental to success.

He added that while Libya has been sold as an air operation, and RAF Tornados and Typhoons performed brilliantly in repeatedly striking targets with no collateral damage, the Royal Navy, British Army Apache pilots and the Royal Air Force all performed to their usual exemplary standard:

But our mandate was civilian protection and enforcement of a no-fly zone. The Libyan people, operating on the ground, made the decisive changes to the future of their country. That could not have been, should not have been, and was not done by a coalition operating from the air. They were the land element. An ‘army’ was still vital. As this was delivered by our Arab partners, both from Libya and the Gulf.

Libya is not a template, but one key lesson for us is this need for partners. Our alliances, formal and informal, established and new, will help shape our military actions over the next decade. As we find it harder to maintain large armies or politics make it more difficult to employ them in isolation from others, partnering will become more vital. And the British Army’s role in building these partnerships in advance of combined operations or pre-emptively will be crucial.

In sum, the ingredients to every campaign will always be the same but the formula one uses to mix them will depend on the unique circumstances confronting us on the day. Air, land and sea components will have to be balanced in different theatres in different ways just as will the blend of diplomatic and economic activity.

General Richards concluded his speech saying that innovative thinking and most importantly retaining a warrior ethos will prove decisive in staying ahead:

We are excellent at this, which is one reason why I am confident that we are broadly in good shape and will have a seriously capable joint force in 2020. Indeed, the principal reason for my confidence is not the equipment but the quality of the men and women who serve. Throughout the 40 years I have had the honour to serve I have never failed to be impressed by the quality, drive and ingenuity of the men and women alongside me.

Like no doubt all my friends, I never expected to be their professional head but it is a sheer delight and great privilege to be so."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nottingham-cheers-home-2-mercian-from-afghanistan,News story,Nottingham cheers home 2 MERCIAN from Afghanistan,Hundreds of people lined the streets of Nottingham and Derby last week to welcome home the soldiers of 2nd Battalion The Mercian Regiment (2 MERCIAN).,Ministry of Defence,4 July 2012,"People hung out of office windows and shoppers stopped to greet the soldiers with applause and cheers of ‘well done’ and ‘thank you’ as they marched through the cities’ streets to mark their return home from Afghanistan.

Prior to the first homecoming parade, in Nottingham, the battalion held a thanksgiving service at St Mary’s Church to remember their fallen, including Captain Rupert Bowers and Private Matthew Haseldin who were killed in action during this latest, the battalion’s fourth, tour of Afghanistan.

Following each parade the soldiers attended a civic reception that saw six soldiers from each city awarded their Op HERRICK campaign medals. Amongst those soldiers receiving their medals in Nottingham was Private Frazier Stretton.

Private Stretton took part in vehicle patrols securing Route 611 in Helmand province and he also patrolled with teams on the ground securing areas in the local villages.

He said:

It’s been a great day. I enjoyed taking part in the parade and it was great to receive my medal in my home city.

The Commanding Officer of 2 MERCIAN, Lieutenant Colonel Colin Marks, said:

I am extremely proud of what we have achieved. Our soldiers worked tirelessly through sweltering heat to set the highest standards in every respect. It was a great privilege to take part in the homecoming parades.

It was a long hard-fought winter where every soldier stood firm with courage in the face of adversity, and I know that everyone of us was deeply grateful for the support that the public gave and at the same time intensely proud that we are finally home, having done a job to the best of our ability.

2 MERCIAN was deployed across the whole of Helmand province from the end of August 2011 to the end of April 2012. The battalion already had a distinguished record in Afghanistan when they deployed in September 2011 for their fourth Op HERRICK tour.

Their achievements over past tours have rendered them one of the most decorated battalions in the British Army, including five Conspicuous Gallantry Crosses and five Military Crosses for their services during Operation HERRICK.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/rfa-wave-knight-returns-from-11-month-deployment,News story,RFA Wave Knight returns from 11-month deployment,"Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) tanker Wave Knight has been welcomed home to Portland as she returned from 11 months away, east of Suez.",Ministry of Defence,20 March 2012,"Wave Knight was welcomed home on Friday 16 March by loved ones of the ship’s company which was made up of RFA personnel as well as some Royal Navy and Fleet Air Arm personnel in support of her 815 Naval Air Squadron Lynx flight.

Since leaving the UK, the fleet tanker has supported the international naval mission in the Middle East, providing fuel and other supplies to sustain the ongoing fight against piracy and other criminal activities in those troubled waters.

The tanker’s time away from the UK has been devoted to supporting the international naval effort east of Suez, providing fuel for coalition ships and aircraft, but also carrying out ‘front line duties’ on occasion.

The ship escorted P&O cruise ships Oriana and Arcadia through pirate-prone waters as hundreds of passengers stood on deck excitedly waving flags in acknowledgment.

Wave Knight also successfully co-ordinated the rescue of the crew of a stricken pleasure craft - the Princess Melisa. The vessel had issued a mayday distress call and was capsizing off the coast of Oman.

RFA Wave Knight’s Commanding Officer, Captain Chris Clarke, said:

Whilst it is always a pleasure to return home, we shall miss the work and daily uncertainty that is ever-present when operating East of Suez.

You never know what each day will bring - other than the unexpected. It is likely to occur and you have got to be ready for it.

The work we do for the maritime community and the support we provide to our Government and our allies is always appreciated - whether that is providing logistic support, reassuring ships on the high seas, deterring and preventing illegal activities such as piracy or simply being ready and poised to react to geopolitical events.

In her 11 months away, the ship steamed 57,460 miles (87,000 km) and replenished 56 warships and five tankers, issuing over 21,000 cubic metres of diesel fuel and 2,000 cubic metres of aviation fuel in the process.

Captain Clarke added:

As ever, none of what we have achieved would have been possible without the dedication and professionalism of the ship’s company or without the support of so many family, friends and working colleagues at home.

We dedicate this homecoming to them."

Start dates for culling activity will be decided by the licensed companies.

Under the terms of the authorisation letters, licensees have been set a minimum number of badgers to be removed – these are 615 in Gloucestershire and 316 in Somerset. A maximum number of badgers has also been set (1091 in Gloucestershire, 785 in Somerset) to safeguard the local populations:

The minimum and maximum numbers are based on the estimates of the badger populations in 2013 set out in the Independent Expert Panel’s report, and the new evidence we have of badger activity on the ground in 2014.

In light of the advice provided by the Independent Expert Panel regarding the significant difficulties in achieving accurate estimates of badger populations, Natural England will keep the minimum number under review and will, if appropriate, provide further advice on the level of culling effort and badger removal required to achieve an effective cull.

Natural England has worked closely together with Defra and the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) to develop a robust monitoring regime for this year’s culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire.

A Government-approved training programme has been put in place to improve shooting accuracy. Natural England will monitor controlled shooting through field observations to record accuracy in 60 cases.

Vets from AHVLA will carry out post-mortem examinations on at least 60 randomly-selected badgers from each cull area to assess accuracy of controlled shooting. These measures have been put in place to implement the recommendations made by the Independent Experts Panel following last year’s pilots.

Licensees have formally advised Natural England:

Natural England has confirmed to licensees:

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/royal-irish-troops-praise-afghan-partners,News story,Royal Irish troops praise Afghan partners,"In a husky voice, raw not from celebratory pints of Guinness but from recent homecoming parades, Lieutenant Colonel Colin Weir, Commanding Officer…",Ministry of Defence,28 April 2011,"In a husky voice, raw not from celebratory pints of Guinness but from recent homecoming parades, Lieutenant Colonel Colin Weir, Commanding Officer of 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment (1 R IRISH), briefed members of the media.

As part of 16 Air Assault Brigade, 1 R IRISH had just returned from their deployment to Nad ‘Ali (South), and the Colonel was keen to talk about their successes.

When the 1,000 men and women under his command arrived to form the core of Combined Force Nad ‘Ali for HERRICK 13, with a squadron of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment to transport them around in their formidable Mastiff armoured vehicles, they and their coalition partners had one aim:

Whether we were British, American or Afghan, we all wanted one thing,” said Lt Col Weir, “to help develop the people’s confidence by providing them a secure enough space that their government could help them achieve a better life.

Although the efforts of preceding battle groups, such as the Grenadier Guards and 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment, had forced the Taliban out of the northern part of Zarghun Kalay, there was still a thorn in the side of the district - a Taliban sanctuary known as the ‘Red Wedge’. It was a thorn 1 R IRISH were determined to remove.

When we arrived, thanks to ISAF and the Afghan security forces there was a bustling bazaar, a clinic, and a strong police presence,” said Lt Col Weir.

The constant refrain from adults was that they wanted the roads opened so they could take their produce to other bazaars and so that they could reach the district centre. And the refrain from the children was that they wanted schools.

However, some of the outlying areas were not yet secure, and worst of all was the Red Wedge, a triangle driven into the north of 1 R IRISH’s operational area.

Checkpoint Shingul is barely 2.5km from the centre of Zarghun Kalay, and it was under attack every day. The fighting was intense, the enemy were capable; hard core out-of-area fighters who demonstrated that they were adept at command and control and small unit tactics,” said Lt Col Weir.

That no soldiers were killed, Lt Col Weir puts down to the quality of the training and kit:

In particular the new Osprey body armour.

In effect, Shingul was cut off from Zarghun Kalay and the enemy had the local population in its grip. Insurgents were using the wedge as a staging post from which to launch attacks into the district centre and to plant IEDs, especially along the main route, Route Plymouth.

Until we removed that threat, the Government could not move forward in any real way. The ultimate aim was to connect the people physically and psychologically to their Government,” said Lt Col Weir.

The District Governor wanted the Red Wedge cleared, and 1 R IRISH were happy to oblige. It was their first major operation and would take a month.

On two occasions with the Afghan National Army (ANA) taking the lead, 100 British and ANA troops were inserted at night by helicopter into the heartland of the enemy. Although it was the first of their aerial operations, it was by no means their last. The largest took place at the end of their tour in an area to the south of Nad ‘Ali on the boundary of Marjah and involved the insertion of huge numbers of troops using 15 helicopters in a combined air and land manoeuvre operation. Having cleared the area, the enemy were held off while a checkpoint was established.

Our partners in the ANA unit took on this most difficult task, securing the western edge of the Red Wedge, forcing open the route and employing its newly-trained counter-IED experts,” said Lt Col Weir.

The newly-constructed police checkpoint meant that Route Plymouth could be kept open, and access to the district government maintained:

The District Governor and members of his ministry came to meet the people rather than waiting for the people to come to them. They listened to the issues and things began to happen.

Almost immediately shops began to spring up everywhere with agricultural equipment distributed and irrigation ditches cleared.

It also served to introduce the people to their new police force,” said Lt Col Weir. “People had been sceptical at first, believing they would be the same as the old police force, but the output of the Helmand Police Training Centre showed them that the new police force was markedly different.

Keen to give his ANA partners their full due, Lt Col Weir said:

Afghans did all of this work. Afghans secured this area. We assisted them, but by the time we established the checkpoint we were very much in the background. Since the op finished there have been no direct fire engagements in the area Zarghun Kalay (West), and only a handful of IEDs have been laid.

In February, Zarghun Kalay was handed over to Afghans to take the security lead, thus releasing ISAF soldiers to operate in higher risk areas and to concentrate on mentoring the Afghan Army and Police. In a voice, now even huskier, Lt Col Weir said:

The ANA and the ANP [Afghan National Police] are more than capable of looking after themselves now. And, they are more than capable of looking after their people.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/british-and-afghan-forces-enter-sayedabad,News story,British and Afghan forces enter Sayedabad,"British and Afghan forces involved in the latest push against the Taliban in central Helmand yesterday entered the town of Sayedabad, the main objective of Operation TOR SHEZADA.",Ministry of Defence,3 August 2010,"Under the cover of darkness on Day 4 of the operation, Monday 2 August 2010, soldiers from Somme Company, 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment (1 LANCS), 1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, 21 Engineer Regiment and the Counter-IED Task Force patrolled carefully through fields and waist-deep irrigation ditches to reach the outskirts of the town.

In a swift move, under the protection of fire support provided by troops out to the east, two compounds to the south of the village were cleared of possible insurgents and IEDs.

Major Darren Newman, Officer Commanding Somme Company, said at the time:

The Company along with our Afghan partners has cleared through Sayedabad and we have systematically cleared through each of the compounds looking for insurgent activity.

Once a foothold had been achieved and defensive positions established in the compounds, two joint units of British and Afghan soldiers moved forward, clearing through the town on the west and east sides from the south.

See Related Links for more images and video footage from Day 4 of Operation TOR SHEZADA as British and Afghan forces enter the town of Sayedabad.

At each stage, Afghan security forces were used to interact with the local Sayedabad population.

Major Newman continued:

As we have pushed through we’ve found nothing to suggest the Taliban have been here in the last 48 to 72 hours.

It appears the presence of overwhelming forces from ISAF and the ANA [Afghan National Army] has effectively meant the insurgents have fled out of this area before we arrived.

Local atmospherics appear to be good. The locals are welcoming and pleased with our presence,” he added.

Once the village had been cleared, ISAF forces held a shura (a local meeting) with the elders of the town to explain what had been happening.

Major Newman said:

They’ve agreed to work with us in partnership to provide security here and clear the area of improvised explosive devices.

Their main concern was security. Clearly if we have a permanent presence here that is something we hope to address in the very first instance.

Security is the main focus for the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in the region. Although Sayedabad was free of insurgents, as the shura was taking place heavy gunfire could be heard some 800m to the north as Corunna Company, 1 LANCS, continued its push south to open up the road between Sayedabad and Nad ‘Ali.

The road continues to present a heavy IED threat to ISAF forces and the local population.

Major Newman concluded:

We’ll now look to consolidate our position and start searching for improvised explosive devices in the vicinity of the local compounds and routes in and out. Where we find them we’ll remove them."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/spreading-the-british-armys-influence-in-africa,News story,Spreading the British Army's influence in Africa,A small unit in the Ugandan capital of Kampala is helping to spread the British Army's expertise across East Africa. Report by Sharon Kean.,Ministry of Defence,17 February 2011,"Most British soldiers bound for Africa find themselves exercising in the jungles around Mount Kenya or basking in the intense heat of Archer’s Post.

However, increasing numbers of UK military personnel are joining short-term missions to neighbouring Uganda where they are helping to prepare the nation’s army, the Uganda People’s Defence Force (UPDF), for a difficult deployment to nearby Somalia.

After nearly two decades without a functioning government, the troubled country has been plagued by clan warfare and, more recently, Islamist insurgents who are destabilising attempts to introduce law and order and are putting the region at risk of becoming the new front line in the global battle against terrorism.

With UPDF troops leading the charge against extremist fighters in Mogadishu, an operational theatre with direct relevance to wider world security, British personnel are making a key contribution to the fight for peace and stability.

Typically spending up to two weeks in-country, UK training teams  use hard-earned experience from the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq to train the East African soldiers in areas as diverse as the English language, medical care, operational law, combat logistics and media operations.

Over the past 12 months the Defence Section, based at the British High Commission in Kampala, has orchestrated nearly 60 such visits by groups whose work is indirectly assisting the challenging campaign in Mogadishu.

Sharing British military expertise will strengthen the Ugandan troops leading the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), which is tasked with providing a secure environment in which a transitional government can enforce law and order:

In terms of our security priorities and the threat from Africa, what AMISOM is doing is really important,” explained Martin Shearman, the British High Commissioner in Kampala.

Uganda currently has 4,400 soldiers deployed in Mogadishu, alongside 3,200 troops from Burundi, fighting what is essentially a counter-insurgency battle bearing striking similarities to the International Security Assistance Force mission in Afghanistan:

We went in originally under the impression that we were going to conduct peacekeeping support operations but unfortunately that has not been the case,” the UPDF’s current commander of land forces, Lieutenant General Katumba Wamala, said.

“We are seeing a counter-terrorism environment so we need to prepare our troops for that.”

Lieutenant General Wamala has been at the helm of the Ugandan-led mission since foreign troops first entered Somalia in March 2007.

In that time AMISOM personnel and the fledgling Somali administration have had to contend with the threat of terrorism from Al-Shabab, an anti-government organisation that has publicly aligned itself with Al-Qaeda and carried out numerous violent attacks on troops, civilians and parliamentarians in the troubled country’s capital:

The way they operate is very typical of Al-Qaeda,” explained Lieutenant General Wamala.

They use the same tactics - IEDs, suicide bombers and foreign fighters. It calls for a lot of training which is why we need skills from a lot of people.

We have had a company from the French, American and British armies and each of those has made its own contribution and added value to the mission.

We take advantage of their experience and exposure in Afghanistan and Iraq because the theatre we will operate in is more or less the same.

Since taking up a post at the Defence Section in Kampala, Lieutenant Colonel Simon Etherington has prioritised building capacity within the UPDF:

I think I’ve been successful. Last year we had 59 incoming visits to Uganda and I think it’s put the nation back on the map - they are very willing partners,” he said.

A future goal for the Defence Section is to provide longer courses, designed to generate fully-trained specialists within the Ugandan Army who can go on to become tutors themselves.

Lieutenant Colonel Etherington believes that one of the most important areas for development is media operations and getting the UPDF to embrace technology, such as the internet, as a military tactic:

It’s a big one - at the moment Al-Shabab are winning the media war because they video attacks and put them on YouTube 15 minutes later,” he said.

Getting AMISOM to use this technology is a key enabler. It’s cheap and can have an immediate effect. It doesn’t have to take millions of pounds and tanks.

Other aspects of Ugandan capacity-building employ more traditional military methods.

In the case of a recent visit to the country by 3rd Battalion The Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment, British soldiers helped run a pre-deployment mission rehearsal exercise for home-based troops, making use of a newly-constructed training village at the UPDF’s base in Singo (visit the MOD website tomorrow to read more on this):

Last year they were training in a field for operations in an urban environment so I got 20 shipping crates dumped on the ground, cut some windows and doors out and built something more akin to the two-storey buildings they would encounter,” explained Lieutenant Colonel Etherington.

It’s not Mogadishu but it’s much better than what was there before and enables them to practise room and compound clearing drills.

Another project carried out under his watch was the funding and construction of a rapid deployment headquarters for the UPDF - akin to a smaller version of the UK’s Joint Force Headquarters.

The three-strong Defence Section also covers sub-Saharan neighbours Rwanda and Burundi and has directed some of its resources to help train and strengthen both nations’ armed forces.

As well as ensuring the MOD’s objectives for the East African countries are achieved, Lieutenant Colonel Etherington has a dual role as an in-country military adviser to the British High Commissioner:

Having defence links here is very important - it’s not just about being nice to foreigners,” said High Commissioner Shearman.

There is some return to the UK in terms of training but it’s also an important part of the bilateral relationship.

The Ugandan forces are very influential and input into their government, so being able to access military people through military channels is very important.

Before Lieutenant Colonel Etherington leaves his post this summer he hopes to sharpen the focus on Burundi’s forces and plans are under way to construct a mock training village similar to the one built in Singo.

As with the British work in Uganda, the aim will be to leave a lasting impression that enables the nation to hone its own expertise and in turn assist in bringing improved security to the African continent.

However, we must better honour our heroes and all they stand for by ensuring that we provide the buildings and facilities for the ever increasing number of visitors. We are delighted that the funds raised through this wonderful Royal Mail initiative will help us achieve this.

HRH Prince William is patron of the £8m Appeal, which will fund the building of a Veterans Pavilion to provide a venue for events and acts of Remembrance for the 200 military units, ex-Service groups and other interested parties to meet.

It will also enable the Arboretum to expand its work to educate children nationwide in history, the environment and citizenship.

Royal Mail spokesperson Philip Parker said:

The contribution of the Armed Forces is regularly recognised by Royal Mail stamps. We hope this special commemorative sheet is a particularly fitting tribute to those who have given their lives and that the proceeds raised will help support the Arboretum in its work to provide a national centre of remembrance.

As well as the Armed Forces Memorial, many of the other memorials and tributes at the 150-acre Arboretum are featured on the stamp sheet and accompanying presentation folder."

The ACRS is one of the most ambitious resettlement programmes in the world, and the first bespoke scheme in Europe to begin resettling Afghan evacuees.

The ACRS, part of the government’sNew Plan for Immigration, will provide up to 20,000 Afghan citizens with a safe and legal route to resettle in the UK in the coming years. It prioritises those who assisted UK efforts in Afghanistan and stood up for values such as democracy, women’s rights, freedom of speech and the rule of law – as well as at-risk women, girls, and members of minority groups. This is in addition to evacuated British nationals, and the more than 7,000 people who have been relocated under theAfghan Relocations and Assistance Policy(ARAP).

Minister for Afghan Resettlement, Victoria Atkins, said:

Launching the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme is a landmark moment for our country. I am proud that communities up and down the UK have opened their arms to vulnerable Afghan families who have been forced to flee their country.

The Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme provides a safe, legal and secure way for the most vulnerable and at-risk people from Afghanistan to come to the United Kingdom and rebuild their lives, as part of the New Plan for Immigration.

This scheme is just the beginning. Now it’s time to pick up the pace and get more Afghan families into work, into education and into permanent homes so they can integrate, thrive and rebuild their lives here in the UK.

Three bespoke referral pathways under the ACRS will enable Afghan nationals to resettle and thrive in the UK:

Since it was announced, a huge and complex cross-government effort has taken place to ensure everybody evacuated to the UK has the support they need, including appropriate housing, schooling, and healthcare.

The government is working with partners in the devolved administrations and local government to support Afghan evacuees, delivering on its New Plan for Immigration by supporting those who come here legally to integrate into UK communities. Councils receive a generous funding deal to help them deliver this support, with £20,520 per person provided over 3 years, with additional funding for children entering education, English language provision, and healthcare.

The government is pursuing all avenues to accelerate the process of matching families to settled accommodation, including making more homes available through the private rented sector. Those who believe they can assist the effort are encouraged to visit the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities’Afghanistan housing portal, which connects them to appropriate local authorities.

The UK government undertook the biggest and fastest emergency evacuation in recent history, helping over 15,000 people to safety in the UK, and around 1,500 more since the evacuation. The ACRS operates alongside the government’s other safe and legal resettlement routes, which have provided tens of thousands of at-risk people with the chance to start a new life in the UK. Since 2015, the UK has helped more people through resettlement schemes than any other country in Europe.  Every person who comes to the UK will be subject to the same strict security checks as those resettled through other schemes.

Almost one hundred Royal Marines have been honing their skills on boat assets such as offshore raiding craft and Landing Craft Vehicle Personnel, supported by a Royal Navy Lynx helicopter and the patrol boat HMS Blazer.

The series of familiarisation exercises are helping to develop the safety and security operation for the River Thames. They have been designed to make sure that everyone has the same level of knowledge and that the military and MPU tactics work together.

Secretary of State for Defence, Philip Hammond, said:

As we get closer to the Games, the public can expect to see more exercises like this, which I hope will provide reassurance that everything possible is being done to ensure the event is safe, secure and enjoyable for all those attending and participating.

“This exercise is an example of the way in which military personnel and assets will support the police-led security effort for this year’s Olympic and Paralympic Games. London 2012 will be a once-in-a-generation event for the UK, and the Armed Forces are proud to play their part.”

Major Paul ‘Stits’ Stitson, Second-in-Command of 539 ASRM, said:

The Royal Marines have used a variety of boat and air assets, working successfully in support of the Metropolitan Police.

During the exercise we tested and developed responses to potential security threats that may arise during the Games this summer.

The Met’s Assistant Commissioner Chris Allison, National Olympic Security Coordinator, said:

All of our planning is designed to mitigate against potential risks during the summer of 2012, and this is an example of where we will be using specialist military capability to support us. This exercise is not in response to any specific threat, but is part of our planning to pre-deploy certain specialist assets to bolster our operation.

This will be a summer like no other in London. The Thames runs through the very heart of our capital and will be a popular place for people who want to be part of the Olympic spirit. This is all part of our planning to ensure this summer’s events take place safely and securely.

Taking part in this week’s exercise are up to 44 officers from the Metropolitan Police, a Force Firearms Unit and Air Support Unit, and, from the Marine Policing Unit:

Also taking part are up to 94 Royal Marines personnel (including support personnel) and various military marine craft, including:"

The British and Afghan troops are already learning from each other, with the Brits passing on their elite soldiering skills while the Afghans share their crucial knowledge of the local terrain and population.

Now, out on patrol, the Afghans are also being familiarised with the various weapon systems that the British paratroopers use against the insurgency.

Lieutenant David Donnelly said:

Over the last few days, since arriving, the ANA soldiers have been fully integrated into the battalion, with the soldiers living and working side by side, building the relationships that are so key to success in this environment.

Captain Graham Brady of the Scots Guards, an officer working with the Brigade Advisory Group, the British unit responsible for overseeing ANA development, said:

I’ve been really impressed by how naturally the 3 PARA soldiers have taken to partnering. They’ve got some big characters, with the confidence and personality to bridge the language and cultural divide.

The success of our, and subsequent tours, will be judged not necessarily by what damage we can do to the insurgent but by how well we set up our Afghan partners for success.

The ANA have been operating in these areas for years in some cases; they pick up on local dynamics much faster than British or other ISAF soldiers can.

This working relationship and the ability of the ANA to pick up and affect local dynamics was evident on the new partnered force’s first patrol.

The two armies worked hand in hand to set up a checkpoint in the local area where the ANA took the lead by taking control of the operation, integrating with the locals and providing the security element to the area."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/life-support-for-precious-yorkshire-peatlands,Press release,LIFE support for precious Yorkshire peatlands,The future of England's largest lowland peat bogs is looking brighter thanks to new funding from the European Union LIFE+ programme.,Natural England,5 August 2014,"Natural England has confirmed that the LIFE+ programme - the EU’s funding programme for the environment and climate action - has awarded a grant of £2.2 million to support additional conservation management work on the precious lowland raised bog habitat of the Humberhead Peatlands, near Doncaster in South Yorkshire.

The funding will extend the area of peatbog habitat under active restoration and will help provide a long-term future for the rare plants, birds and insects that have evolved to live on the unique wetland habitat.

Natural England is already carrying out restoration work on itsHumberhead PeatlandsNational Nature Reserve (NNR) which is part of two internationally important sites - Thorne Moors Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and Hatfield MoorsSAC– which together make up the UK’s largest lowland raised bog complex.

The LIFE+ grant will help ensure that the peat across the 28 square kilometres of the area is wet enough so that wildlife - including birds such as nightjar and hobby and specialist plants including cotton grasses, bog mosses, bog rosemary and wild cranberries - can thrive. The project will also enable research and monitoring to be undertaken into the bog’s unique bird and insect populations which will help similar restoration projects elsewhere.

Welcoming the EU LIFE+ funding, Julian Small,NNRmanager, said: “Restored peatlands are not only wonderful places for wildlife, they also store water, helping to reduce flooding, soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and provide tranquil places for people to visit. We are very grateful to the EU LIFE+ fund and to Doncaster East Internal Drainage Board (DEIDB) for their financial support, which will help to safeguard the Humberhead Peatlands for future generations of wildlife and for people to enjoy.”

The LIFE+ Project enhances the Water Level Management Plan already being undertaken by the DE IDB work on Thorne Moors. The Board will be working with Natural England to carefully manage the water levels on the Moors so that the special bog wildlife can thrive once again. The LIFE+ funding provided by the European Union matches funding already secured by DEIDB, along with a contribution from Natural England.

Ken Knight, Chairman of theDEIBD, said: “This major funding from the EU builds on the Water Level Management Plan being undertaken by the board, in conjunction with the Environment Agency, Natural England and JBA Consulting. It’s great news for the moors and the Doncaster area which has these remarkable, internationally significant, and beautiful sites on its doorstep.”

Large areas of Thorne and Hatfield Moors were bought for the nation in 2003 and are recovering from more than 100 years of industrial peat extraction. Whilst much initial work was completed and is proving successful, the bog is in need of further long-term restoration due to the impact of commercial peat extraction which occurred from the 1870s until 2004 leaving only a shallow depth of peat over much of the site.

The three year project will be completed by June 2017 and will leave a lasting legacy for Britain’s largest lowland bogs. Water levels for bog restoration will be carefully managed using dams, weirs, bunds and by reducing the amount of water being sucked out of the peat by scrub vegetation.

Jeff Lunn, Natural England’s Area Manager added: “Lowland raised peat bogs are one of the most threatened habitats in Europe, and South Yorkshire can boast of some of the most important sites in the UK. This project is an excellent example of how Natural England works innovatively with partners to make the best use of limited resources for the benefit of the natural environment.

“Restoration of raised bog sites is an expensive, long-term activity and this LIFE+ funding and the support of the Doncaster East Internal Drainage Board is a significant and welcome investment in combating climate change, looking after one of the country’s most valuable and rare wildlife habitats, and preventing flooding.”

A LIFE+ project manager will lead a dedicated team to ensure that the work is delivered, supported by a steering group of partners. Eleven jobs will be created with the recruitment of people to carry out work on the ground during the lifetime of the project.

TheLIFE programmeis the EU’s funding programme for the environment and climate action. The general objective of LIFE is to contribute to the implementation, updating and development of EU environmental and climate policy and legislation by co-financing projects with European added value.

LIFE began in 1992 and to date there have been four complete phases of the programme (LIFE I: 1992-1995, LIFE II: 1996-1999, LIFE III: 2000-2006 and LIFE+: 2007-2013). During this period, LIFE has co-financed some 3954 projects across the EU, contributing approximately €3.1 billion to the protection of the environment.

The European Commission manages the LIFE programme.

Natural England is the government’s advisor on the natural environment. Established in 2006 our work is focused on enhancing England’s wildlife and landscapes and maximising the benefits they bring to the public.

England’s 224 NNRs form part of a UK-wide network of nature reserves covering England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Natural England manages 143 of these NNRs to ensure that our finest wildlife and geological sites are protected, conserved and enhanced for present and future generations. From Lindisfarne in Northumberland to The Lizard in Cornwall, and from the Suffolk Coast in East Anglia to The Stiperstones in Shropshire – NNRs are the very best places to experience the natural world at first hand.

The Doncaster East Internal Drainage Board was formed in April 2012. The Board’s purpose is to protect people and their property against river and surface water flooding through water level management within low lying areas predominately from the east of Doncaster towards the River Idle and River Torne which discharge into the River Trent. As part of its remit, the Board also works with Local Authorities and the Environment Agency and other public bodies, continuing to manage water levels for the overall benefit of people, property, commerce, industry, agriculture and the aquatic environment within the defined Drainage District.

Formed in 1989Thorne and Hatfield Moors Conservation Forumacts as an umbrella for a wide range of like-minded organisations. Its extensive network is drawn from voluntary organisations and natural history societies, and it has observers from statutory agencies and local authorities. The Forum has on occasions taken on a campaigning role, but this aspect of its work has always been underpinned by robust science, and research, survey and monitoring remain key activities. The Forum is administered by an Executive Committee and it publishes its findings extensively."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/historic-london-parkland-gets-national-recognition-for-its-nature-conservation-importance,Press release,Historic London parkland gets national recognition for its nature conservation importance,Two of London’s much-loved parks have been officially recognised as being among the most important places for wildlife in England.,Natural England,9 September 2014,"Natural England’s Executive Board recently approved the designation of Bushy Park and Home Park in the London Borough of Richmond as a newSite of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).

SSSIs represent the best sites for wildlife and geology and there are more than 4,100 SSSIs in England, covering around 8 per cent of the country.  SSSI status gives legal protection that ensures that the nationally important wildlife and geology of a site is recognised in its management and future use.

Bushy Park and Home Park SSSI is of special interest for its exceptionally large population of ancient and veteran trees, extensive areas of semi-natural lowland dry acid grassland, and its internationally significant populations of rare invertebrates.

More than 200 veteran trees have been identified at the site of which 94 are classed as ancient.  The site is the highest ranking of ten comparable sites in the Greater London area and one of only 44 sites nationally known to support more than 100 veteran trees.  The trees at Bushy Park and Home Park are rare relicts of a wood-pasture management on the site that dates back to the 15th Century.  The trees include oak and lime with some horse chestnut and sweet chestnut and approximately sixteen other species of tree.  A notable feature is the occurrence of a large number of very old hawthorn trees, many of which are festooned with mistletoe.

The great age of many of the trees at the site provides an abundance of dead and fallen timber.  Inside these trees there is a succession of fungi which actively break down the heartwood to produce a rich internal wood mould.  This habitat, often deep within a large living tree, provides the perfect environment for specialised saproxylic (wood feeding) invertebrate species.

The site is home to so many rare and threatened species of wood feeding invertebrates that it ranks amongst the top five in Britain for this highly specialised group of creatures, for which Britain has international importance

The majority of the 540ha site that has been notified as SSSI is held in trust by the Crown Estate.  Bushy Park is managed byThe Royal Parksand Home Park byHistoric Royal Palaceswho have both welcomed the SSSI designation and are looking forward to working with Natural England’s Thames Valley team over the future sympathetic management requirements of the special interest of the site.

Janette Ward, Natural England’s Director for Conservation Strategy and Innovation, said: “We are delighted to be able to notify Bushy Park and Home Park as England’s latest SSSI and pleased that the new designation has been supported by both the Royal Parks and Historic Royal Palaces.

“The SSSI status will help to protect a very important site for rare habitats and species and provides a great opportunity to enhance both the wildlife and people’s access to nature in one of London’s historic green spaces.”

Nicholas Mallory Garbutt, Tree and Wildlife Conservation Manager, Historic Royal Palaces, said,  “We are delighted that Home Park has received this recognition of its national significance for wildlife conservation.   This historic deer park is a vital part of Hampton Court Palace’s history, which has been enjoyed by everyone from King Henry VIII, to the many visitors who flock to the Hampton Court Flower Show every year.

“The results of recent wildlife surveys show that the historic trees and acid grassland of the park provide an important habitat for wildlife conservation, and we look forward to working with Natural England to continue to preserve this environment for future generations.”

Ray Brodie, Manager of Bushy Park, Royal Parks, said:  “This is a great accolade for Bushy Park and confirms what we have long-known to be true: that Bushy Park is one of the finest sites in England for wildlife and ecology. Bushy Park contains many rare and important species and habitats including rare stag beetles and around ten different species of bat.

“The Royal Parks works hard to conserve and protect this unique environment, while also ensuring that Bushy Park is a peaceful haven for the many thousands of visitors who come each year to relax, unwind and enjoy the natural surroundings.”

There is now a four month period when people with an interest in the site can make representations or objections to Natural England. Natural England’s Board will then consider any unresolved objections before deciding whether to formally confirm the site’s new status.

A Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) is one of the country’s very best wildlife and/or geological sites. SSSIs include some of the most spectacular and beautiful habitats: wetlands teeming with wading birds, winding chalk rivers, flower-rich meadows, windswept shingle beaches and remote upland peat bogs. There are more than 4,100 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) in England, covering around 8% of the country’s land area. More than 70% of these sites (by area) are internationally important for their wildlife and designated as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), Special Protection Areas (SPAs) or Ramsar sites.

A ‘veteran tree’ is usually in the second or mature stage of its life and has important wildlife and habitat features including; hollowing or associated decay fungi, holes, wounds and large dead branches. It will generally include old trees but also younger, middle aged trees where premature aging characteristics are present.

The term ‘ancient tree’ refers to trees of interest biologically, aesthetically or culturally because of their great age; trees in the ancient or third and final stage of their life; and, trees that are the old relative to others of the same species.

Bushy Park and Home Park SSSI, London Borough of Richmond was notified as an SSSI by Natural England on 5 September 2014. The site is located to the south west of London in the Borough of Richmond within the Thames Valley National Character Area:  national grid reference TQ159692.  Further information can be obtained from Graham Steven at Natural England, Cromwell House, 15 Andover Road, Winchester, SO23 7BT, telephone number: 0300 060 0398. Any representations or objections about this notification should be made in writing to Graham Steven at the address above, before 5 January 2015."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/plymouth-soldiers-use-advice-from-devon-police-in-helmand,News story,Plymouth soldiers use advice from Devon Police in Helmand,For the past few months a group of Commando Gunners have been putting the advice they received from civilian police in the UK into practice as they mentor members of the Afghan Police in Helmand.,Ministry of Defence,23 September 2011,"Captain Dan Davies and several colleagues from Plymouth-based 79 (Kirkee) Commando Battery Royal Artillery, part of 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery, are working with the Afghan Uniform Police in Helmand province.

Before they deployed though the Commandos met with officers from Devon and Cornwall Police to see if there were insights into the world of policing that would be useful for their tour. Captain Davies said:

We spent time and got a sense of the tough job they face keeping the peace on the streets of our towns and villages.

Five months into the tour, the relevance of that meeting to the Commandos is clear and they have found the advice even more useful than they had originally envisaged:

Arguably, what we’re doing here in Helmand is conducting a police action with soldiers being required to take the role of local police officers,” said Captain Davies.

Progress is being made in Helmand which has meant that kinetic events are, on the whole, fewer in number compared to previous tours:

Op HERRICK 14 could be the first summer tour to build on the gains made during the winter, rather than merely fighting to maintain them,” said Captain Davies.

In order to be successful against the insurgency the approach has necessitated a shift from being just combat-oriented to utilising police techniques in order to capture and detain, rather than kill.

The focus for troops on the ground is on attacking the Taliban’s network, targeting the insurgency at its core, rather than merely removing low-level fighters.

A key lesson that the Commandos learnt from their session with the police back home was that it was often the influence of one or two key criminals in an area that tips the balance and therefore the removal of this influence can have a profound effect far beyond what one might naturally expect from the removal of a small number of individuals:

Another thing we are beginning to understand is that, as with crime, the insurgency is unlikely to ever be completely defeated, but it can be reduced to a manageable level,” said Captain Davies.

To achieve that, just as the police in the UK always say, interacting with the local population is crucial. The numerous checkpoints and patrol bases dotted around the area of operations control and influence their local area, similar to a police ‘beat’.

In that area, the checkpoint or patrol base commander knows the ground, but more importantly he knows the people. He knows the village elders personally and will meet regularly to discuss the needs of the population, acting in many ways similar to a local police officer - listening to people’s concerns and acting to reassure them.

Another similarity to UK policing that Captain Davies and his colleagues have noticed is that providing the local youth, whether that’s in Helmand or on the streets back in the UK, with a viable and attractive alternative to a criminal life is well worth the effort.

In Helmand, where for many years there have been few opportunities for young people, the insurgency can appear exciting and glamorous. It can be difficult for ISAF and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to engage directly with young people because of the hierarchical tribal structure.

Captain Davies said:

We have made efforts to connect directly with the local youth but have been restricted by the reticence of the elders. As a result, we have used the Afghan National Police and Army to speak directly to the elders and encourage them to take responsibility for the actions of the young people of their area.

In any command and control situation, be that in a military or a policing role, having up-to-date, reliable intelligence is crucial.

In their area of operations the Commandos use of intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (ISTAR) assets is similar to how CCTV cameras are used by police in the UK.

While ISTAR assets in Afghanistan are not exactly the same as CCTV cameras in a UK city centre, they are positioned to keep an eye on known trouble spots, deter (or observe) insurgent activity, and provide a starting point for more deliberate targeting:

The laying of improvised explosive devices is often picked up by ISTAR assets,” said Captain Davies, “and we have had several successes from observing insurgent activity and then either launching a strike or tracking insurgents in an effort to build the bigger picture.

In a recent incident, an insurgent was tracked to a compound which was then watched for several days, resulting in the identification of an insurgent cell. The entire cell was then targeted as opposed to a single insurgent, thus achieving a much greater effect.

Finally, there is the importance of perception. In a UK community the regular sight of police officers patrolling the streets is intrinsically linked to the perception of security in the eyes of the population - more patrols (and the more visible the better) equals more security.

How often have we heard the cry ‘we want more police on the streets’?

The same is true in Helmand. If a community sees regular patrols from the security forces, be they ISAF or ANSF [Afghan National Security Forces], it makes them feel safe,” said Captain Davies.

So, while regular patrolling undoubtedly has a deterrent effect on insurgent activity, this is secondary to the effect it has on the perception of security to the local nationals.

We have seen this first-hand during HERRICK 14; increasing the frequency of patrols into the protected communities has led to the local nationals reporting better security. In turn this has meant locals are more likely to report insurgent activity because they aren’t fearful of reprisals.

Maybe it shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise that as the ISAF troops’ role in partnering the Afghan National Security Forces moves increasingly towards maintaining the hard-won security, and British police go to Helmand to train their counterparts, the soldiers can also pick up a thing or two from the professionals.

Nor should we be surprised that communities, wherever they may be, look for the same basic things from their security forces.

Captain Davies and his mates are in no doubt that what they learned from the Devon and Cornwall Police helped them to develop a better understanding of their role and the population that they were supporting:

We look forward to meeting up with the police in Plymouth again on our return and comparing notes,” he said.

And maybe this time the police can pick up a few tips from the Commandos that will help them on the streets of Devon and Cornwall."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/warrant-officer-helps-make-mastiff-a-helmand-hero,News story,Warrant Officer helps make Mastiff a Helmand hero,Discuss the pros and cons of the British Army’s Mastiff armoured patrol vehicle with serving soldiers and you would be hard pushed to find any…,Ministry of Defence,2 September 2010,"Discuss the pros and cons of the British Army’s Mastiff armoured patrol vehicle with serving soldiers and you would be hard pushed to find any dissenting voices.

From its unrivalled blast protection to its suite of hi-tech gadgetry, the six-wheel-drive beast’s combination of power and precision has made it an operational favourite.

But its popularity with troops is no coincidence. Since the British military first enlisted US firm Force Protection’s Cougar and asked NP Aerospace to adapt it, one serviceman has been at the heart of the mission to make Mastiff a HERRICK hero.

Warrant Officer Class 2 Darren Hugill, Urgent Operational Requirements Warrant Officer at the Defence School of Transport’s Advanced Training Wing, leads the team responsible for teaching crews how to use the vehicles.

And such is his intimate knowledge of the platform, WO2 Hugill is known throughout the Army - and beyond - as Mr Mastiff:

It’s not a title I’ve given myself, but I’m very proud of it,” he said. “When I was first given the opportunity to work with the US Cougar, I grabbed it by the horns.

These vehicles won’t win the battle, but they will help save a lot of lives. They might not have the firepower of a Warrior or a Challenger 2, but the level of protection they offer is massive.

There has not been a single fatality in one to enemy action in theatre and that proves the survivability is second-to-none.

WO2 Hugill and his team of nearly 40 senior non-commissioned officers bring crews up to standard on the Cougar family, which includes variants such as the Wolfhound and St Bernard, using the very latest feedback from theatre.

The experienced soldier wrote the original teaching programme for the Mastiff and regularly deploys to Op HERRICK to refresh his understanding and see if he can make any improvements.

Mr Mastiff’s interest does not stop with the training package; his knowledge of the armoured vehicles has helped him to generate a host of money-saving and potentially life-saving modifications.

From simple additions such as extra stowage spaces and heel plates and foot rests to give drivers a more comfortable ride, to a new system to stop expensive external cameras being broken, he has played an integral part in the vehicle’s continued evolution.

The result is a platform that WO2 Hugill believes has won Service personnel over after it received some short-lived early scepticism when it first rolled into action:

When it initially went into theatre, soldiers didn’t want to get in it because the feeling was that it was just a truck,” he said.

After a couple of months the lads knew they were safe as houses inside and now it’s the vehicle of choice.

They can do incredible things and the guys really appreciate that.

We have seen vehicles that have taken 20 hits but are still going after repairs. Yes, they are expensive, but what price do you put on a soldier’s life?

With another fact-finding mission to Afghanistan scheduled, WO2 Hugill’s dedication to the vehicle is constantly put to the test.

But despite the long hours and heavy workload, Mr Mastiff is showing no signs of relinquishing his title:

I absolutely love my job - it’s the best I have ever had in the Army,” he concluded. “There are people who don’t want me to ever leave this post because there is nothing I don’t know about it.

1st Battalion The Royal Welsh deployed to Afghanistan in December and returned to their UK base, Dale Barracks in Chester, about five weeks ago, having had a central role in several high profile operations, notably Operation MOSHTARAK.

Soldiers from this battalion made the biggest find of improvised explosive devices ever uncovered by British forces in Afghanistan.

The Queen arrived shortly before midday and was greeted by Major General Roddy Porter, Colonel of the Regiment.

A Drumhead service of Thanksgiving preceded the presentation of Operational Service Medals to the 60 soldiers for whom the battalion’s recent tour was their first, with Her Majesty presenting 16 medals, including to six soldiers wounded during the operational tour.

The service remembered the sacrifices of the wounded soldiers and also remembered Fusilier Jonathan Burgess, the only soldier from the battalion to be killed in action during the tour.

The Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Colonel Nick Lock, then led his battalion on a march past, to cheers and applause from thousands of family members and friends who filled the racecourse stands.

Her Majesty The Queen then met with families and soldiers before an official reception and lunch.

Sergeant James Wilson said:

It is a massive boost for the guys that the Queen came to see us today and present medals.

The tour was quite intense and very challenging. We were working with French, Afghans and Estonians, which brings its own challenges which you have to adapt to.

Lance Corporal Gareth Smith said:

It has been a good day, especially for our families to be able to see us getting medals from the Queen. It is great for morale for the lads and the families.

Earlier, Major General Porter officially launched The Royal Welsh Regimental Association, formed from uniting the Regimental Associations of the antecedent regiments, The Royal Welch Fusiliers and The Royal Regiment of Wales.

Nevertheless, their inherent commitment and agility, key characteristics of the modern Royal Air Force, reflect the strong sense of duty I see consistently in our personnel at home, on operations, and that I have witnessed again today.

Having seen the Olympic Park’s security procedures at first hand, ACM Dalton was able to witness the positive reaction of the public to his personnel:

It is not often that the public have the opportunity to meet military personnel face-to-face while they carry out their duties,” he said. “To hear first hand the complimentary remarks from the public makes me especially proud of my fellow servicemen and women.

Elsewhere, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, Commander JFC, visited HMS Bulwark which is located in Portland Harbour to fulfil the role of providing maritime force elements to support Dorset Police’s security plan for the Paralympic sailing events.

ACM Peach met the ship’s company and was briefed on the Maritime Force’s multi-agency, civil/military operation conducted at sea in Weymouth Bay supporting the Dorset Police during this summer’s Olympics security operation.

The Commanding Officer of HMS Bulwark, Captain Alex Burton RN, demonstrated the versatile capabilities of the large command and control vessel, taking ACM Peach on a guided tour of the operations room, the large conference room planning facilities, and the extensive vehicle deck, flight deck and bridge, speaking to many of the departmental specialists as they toured the ship.

As Commander JFC, ACM Peach has responsibility for commanding and generating the joint capabilities allocated to the Command and setting the framework for joint enablers that sit within the Single Services.

The staff at JFC are currently working to establish full operating capability by April 2013. The creation of JFC was a key recommendation in Lord Levene’s Defence Reform Report, which focused on strategic planning and joint operations as part of a wider package of radical reform.

JFC is a key part of this process by ensuring we continue to develop close working relationships between the three Services.

With this specific role in mind, ACM Peach was particularly impressed with the way that HMS Bulwark had used its planning and communications capabilities to integrate the Royal Navy quickly and effectively with civilian London Organising Committee staff and local police to provide security for the Olympic and Paralympic events.

He said:

I have always believed that the three military Services are stronger when they work together; Bulwark’s versatility shows that this is equally true of UK Defence’s support to civil authority.

Commander JFC is the latest in a long line of hundreds of distinguished military and civilian dignitaries and their guests invited onboard HMS Bulwark over the past six weeks.

The ship’s company has been delighted to share their experiences and considerable pride in serving on the Royal Navy’s flagship during this exceptional summer of world class sporting and ceremonial activities, relishing the opportunity to explain the life and ethos of the Royal Navy to the community that supports them."

He also announced additional funding for policing, education, jobs and governance reform in Afghanistan.

Mr Cameron said:

My biggest duty as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is to our Armed Forces and to make sure that they have all the equipment and all of the protection that they need to do the absolutely vital job that they are doing here in Afghanistan.

I’m pleased to announce today that we will be spending an extra £67m on countering the IED threat and actually doubling the number of British teams that are there to counter the threat from those explosive devices.

Mr Cameron emphasised the importance of the relationship between the two countries and that Afghanistan is Britain’s most important foreign policy and national security issue.

He added that this year will be a ‘vital year’ when NATO forces have to make progress - both for the sake of the Afghan people and on behalf of people in Britain ‘who want to see this work and want to see progress’.

The two leaders also met last month and held talks at Chequers where they agreed that the relationship between Afghanistan and Britain should be further strengthened."

And as an extra Christmas bonus, communications provider Paradigm will gift an extra 45 minutes to every UK serviceman and woman deployed in Afghanistan, meaning that they can now talk to family and friends for even longer over the festive season.

Service personnel on operations already get an allowance of 30 minutes talk-time each week, which they can use to make phone calls home.

Troops on operations are also entitled to internet access as well as WiFi, giving personnel access to their emails from the privacy of their accommodation.

Armed Forces Minister Nick Harvey said:

I have the utmost respect for our Armed Forces, who willingly endure the hardship of being separated from their families and loved ones over the festive period to protect our national security. I am delighted that we can offer those deployed on operations this extra talk-time.

Flight Lieutenant Andy Wilson, who is responsible for managing welfare communications for Defence, Equipment and Support, said:

Christmas can be a difficult time for troops and their families and we are pleased that we have been able to offer this extra talk-time so that our boys and girls on the front line can keep in touch with loved ones when it matters the most.

Managing Director of Paradigm, Keith Norton, said:

Our WelComE service means that serving men and women, wherever they are in the world, can always keep in touch with their families and friends. Paradigm is proud to support British troops over the festive period and we are thankful to Cable and Wireless, who have joined us this year in giving our serving men and women additional talk-time over the Christmas period.

Talk-time is part of WelComE (Welfare Communications Everywhere) project, which is run in partnership with communications company Paradigm under the current WelComE service.

Last year the cost of calls made from Afghanistan to a UK landline were reduced from 11 pence to 6.5 pence per minute."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/battle-of-britain-veteran-inspires-special-blend-of-charity-tea,News story,Battle of Britain veteran inspires special blend of charity tea,"A Battle of Britain veteran has been the inspiration for a special blend of tea brewed to honour 'The Few', with some of the proceeds going to the RAF Association Wings Appeal.",Ministry of Defence,1 October 2010,"Terry Clark, aged 91, was an air gunner in a Blenheim light bomber aircraft, used as a night fighter, during the Battle of Britain. His initial job was to defend York and the surrounding airfields from German attacks.

He joined the Auxiliary Air Force at the age of 19, training in Surrey and on the Isle of Man. He said:

The station commander signed my log book but nobody said whether I’d passed the course. I assume I must have done because they sent me off to join 219 Squadron, a Blenheim fighter unit based at Catterick.

Mr Clark and his squadron mates spent much of the Battle of Britain quietly playing pontoon as they waited for a call to arms. But the silence was shattered when the phone rang - it was the signal to scramble. A couple of flicked switches fired up the Blenheims and within minutes crews were airborne:

Spitfire pilots couldn’t see in the dark, but we could,” he said. “Blenheims carried an early form of radar which at the time was unknown to the Germans. We also had ground control radar which was used to get us to the main body of the bombers. But while it could see the big picture, it was down to us to identify the individual aircraft with our radar before opening fire.

A British radar system was well known to the Luftwaffe from intelligence gathered before the war, but the system linked with fighter control had been a well-kept secret and, even where information existed, it was largely ignored as being implausible.

As the conflict reached its zenith and at night the feared Blitz began in earnest, more radar specialists were needed to deal with the threat. so Mr Clark was sent to fly on the Beaufighter long-range heavy fighter aircraft.

His job was to track enemy aircraft and guide the pilot towards the selected ‘contact’. And he was pretty good; one night the pair shot down two enemy fighters.

For his wartime bravery Mr Clark was awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal which to this day he wears with pride alongside five others, including the rare Battle of Britain medal and clasp.

Mr Clark becoming the inspiration for a new blend of tea came about when Henrietta Lovell, of the Rare Tea Company, met him last year while shooting a video and was so taken by his presence that she decided to prepare the ‘Tea for Heroes’.

On the label for her latest blend Henrietta has written:

I first created this tea for a wonderful man called Terry Clark. It was a great honour to make tea for him and he thought it was rather good.

‘Tea for Heroes’ is a traditional British tea, a blend from two plantations, the Makaibari Estate in Darjeeling and the Satemwa Estate in Malawi, and comes in a presentation tin bearing the RAF roundel. Inside, the label features a wartime picture of Mr Clark wearing his uniform. He said:

When Henrietta asked if she could use my photo, I wasn’t too sure. But when she told me that some of the proceeds would go to the Wings Appeal, I thought well why not.

It’s a very good brew and far better than the wartime tea we had in the NAAFI [Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes].

Tea for Heroes is now on sale, with 7 per cent of the proceeds going to theRAF Wings Appealwhich raises money to support serving and former RAF personnel and their families.

But Mr Clark insists he is not a hero. Like most war veterans, Mr Clark frowns on the ‘h-word’ and says he was just doing his bit for King and Country:

The real heroes were in Bomber Command,” he said. “Then there were the ground crew. If they didn’t service the aircraft we’d have never got off the ground, but no one seems to remember them.

Nor can Mr Clark be termed an ‘Ace’. Although he was responsible for the requisite number of confirmed kills, the nomenclature applies only to pilots.

It’s not something that bothers him though because, apart from his family, Mr Clark’s fondest memories are of a pilot, his pilot, the one who saved his life. He explained:

I was with Dudley Hobbis for three years and it was almost like a marriage really. We were very close; we had to be to do our job. After Hobbis stopped flying he planned one last patrol, but by then we were on different flights, so he took the spare navigator. It was the last time I saw him.

I think the Battle of Britain proved to be the turning point of the war,” Mr Clark added. “But at the time we were unaware how vital it was to win. Then Churchill made his famous speech and we realised what it all meant."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/general-parker-reflects-on-armed-forces-contribution-to-the-sporting-summer,News story,General Parker reflects on Armed Forces contribution to the sporting summer,Commander Land Forces General Sir Nick Parker has reflected on the contribution Britain's Armed Forces have made to the success of the Olympic and Paralympic Games.,Ministry of Defence,10 September 2012,"General Parker writes:

This summer of sport has been an extraordinary experience for the Armed Forces. The scope of LOCOG’s task dwarfed even our recent experience of large-scale multinational operations.

We had always planned for the Armed Forces to play a part in ensuring a safe and secure 2012 Games. So when we were required to respond to the manpower shortfalls in security we implemented pre-arranged contingencies.

Of course, many were called up at short notice and had their leave cancelled. But, unsurprisingly to me, the response by sailors, soldiers and airmen and women was good-humoured and outstanding - crises are what we do.

We had to set up a complex logistic support plan providing accommodation, feeding and transport facilities from a standing start. Even though we did not have the usual complication of an enemy, operations of this scale - more than 18,000 Service personnel were deployed - still require quick reaction, rapid planning and effective command.

I was always confident that we were well-placed to help deliver the ‘Greatest Games’ ever. What I was not prepared for was the public’s reaction. The messages of thanks and appreciation have been overwhelming and communities across the country have embraced us.

Being seen in uniform carrying out a task to the benefit of all has left us walking just a little bit taller.

I am particularly proud of those serving and former members of the Armed Forces who competed, particularly those who are overcoming injury. It was a moment of great personal pride to watch my son carry the Paralympic Torch down Whitehall.

The mental and physical courage that has been on show has been both humbling and inspiring; spurring one on to try those things that one might feel can never be accomplished.

So what might be the Games legacy for the military? For me, the contact with the public has been invigorating. The bond between the public and Services has been strengthened, the Armed Forces’ contribution to homeland operations recognised, and the value of a military career reinforced.

We all recognise their courage on the battlefield but now we have evidence to confirm how well our servicemen and women, regular and reserve, conduct themselves at home. I hope it will encourage others to join.

The most significant act of recognition many of us have had is to be openly thanked in the street - not very British perhaps, and we may have looked embarrassed. But the public’s unreserved support for the Armed Forces will have a lasting impact on us."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/army-doctors-attempt-to-row-around-uk,News story,Army doctors attempt to row around UK,Two British Army doctors are attempting to set a new world record for rowing around Great Britain after setting off from Lymington Yacht Haven in Hampshire on Wednesday 12 May 2010.,Ministry of Defence,14 May 2010,"Captains Hamish Reid and Nick Dennison of the Royal Army Medical Corps aim to become the first pair to row non-stop and unsupported around the British mainland and hope to raise £20,000 for ABF The Soldiers’ Charity and Help for Heroes.

They are undertaking the challenge in their 24-foot (7.3m) ocean-going rowing boat ‘Komale’ and are battling high seas, fierce winds and strong tides on a journey of more than 2,100 miles (3,380km) in approximately 45 days.

The record attempt will be dominated by tide cycles, with the two officers alternating between rowing two hours on and two hours off in open seas and resting together at anchor during the foul tide in inshore waters.

They will find themselves rowing up to 20 hours a day, with their sleep patterns dependent on weather conditions.

Capt Dennison is currently based in Bovington Camp, Dorset, home of the Royal Armoured Corps, where he looks after the staff and Phase 2 recruits. He aims to become an anaesthetist.

Capt Reid is currently the Regimental Medical Officer of 22 Engineer Regiment in Tidworth and is hoping to train in sport and rehabilitation medicine. Before setting off he said:

“The row demands prolonged physical endurance and in order to complete it we will have to achieve an elite level of fitness prior to departure.

We have to condition our bodies to deal with fatigue, discomfort and prolonged exertion. Courage, discipline and integrity are fundamental to the success of this challenge.

Capt Dennison added:

The race will put us in situations we have not experienced before and we shall need to dig deep into our mental reserves to maintain our efforts, uphold these standards and, in the worst case, survive.

In order to complete the circumnavigation we need to be well versed in a variety of methods of navigation, everything from GPS to navigating by dead-reckoning.

We aim to set a competitive world record and in order to do this our route and navigation through the inshore waters and tides must be excellent, and to this end we have undertaken both Yachtmaster and sea-survival courses.

Safety is paramount so well-practised safety drills and mastery of radio procedure are vital in our preparation.

Maintaining good physical condition makes the nutritional demands of the row huge. They estimate they will expend 8,000kcals per day and will cater for this in their diet.

During the row they will undertake scientific research into the calorific demands similar to work done by Mike Stroud and Ranulph Fiennes on their polar expedition.

This will provide new insight into the nutritional demands of prolonged exertion and physical degradation - an increasingly important component of current operations.

The two officers first met at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and recently completed the Devizes to Westminster canoe marathon together.

They are not averse to adventure and challenge. Capt Reid attempted to break the world’s longest continuous crawling record and swam the English Channel in 2008 but has never rowed in earnest.

Meanwhile, Capt Dennison cycled from Land’s End to John O’Groats in 2008 and rowed competitively at university."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/120-2012-mod-sets-out-future-of-invincible-class-carriers,News story,120/2012 - MOD Sets out future of Invincible Class carriers,Plans to preserve the legacy of the Royal Navy’s Invincible Class aircraft carriers have been outlined today by the Ministry of Defence.,Ministry of Defence and Philip Dunne,10 September 2012,"HMS Invincible, HMS Illustrious and HMS Ark Royal came into service in the early 1980s and have spent the last thirty years protecting the UK’s interests across the world.

The last of the ships to be decommissioned, HMS Illustrious, is due to retire from the Royal Navy in 2014 and the MoD is announcing the intention to seek proposals from organisations interested in preserving her as a lasting tribute to the work of the Invincible Class, who have played key roles in conflicts in the Falkland Islands, Iraq and Bosnia.

HMS Invincible was decommissioned in 2005 and later recycled. The 31 year old HMS Ark Royal was withdrawn from service last year, following the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review. The MoD can announce today that she will also be recycled as part of a £2.9 million deal with Leyal, the same company responsible for recycling Invincible in 2011.

Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology Philip Dunne said:

It is important that we preserve the legacy of the Royal Navy’s Invincible Class aircraft carriers. When the last of these - HMS Illustrious - retires from the Royal Navy, we would like to see her preserved as a legacy to the work she, Invincible and Ark Royal have done to protect the UK over three decades. We would be keen to seek innovative proposals from a range of organisations, including private sector companies, charities and trusts.

HMS Ark Royal, like her sister ships, served this country with great distinction. Retiring her five years earlier than planned was a difficult decision but it was the right one that, combined with her sale, has saved over a hundred million pounds. That has helped the MoD achieve a sustainable and balanced budget for the first time in decades.

The Royal Navy’s new Queen Elizabeth Class carriers and the Lightning II aircraft that will fly off them are among the biggest projects of the now fully funded equipment programme that will see around £160 billion spent on equipment and support for our Armed Forces of the future.

Preparatory work will be carried out on HMS Ark Royal over the winter to enable her to travel from Portsmouth to Turkey, where she will be recycled, at the same location where HMS Invincible was also recycled. Bids received for further use for HMS Ark Royal were considered, but were judged either not feasible or appropriate, or carried too much risk.

As the out of service date for HMS Illustrious approaches, the MoD will look to industry to provide viable proposals to keep her available for future private use in a different capacity while still offering taxpayers good value for money.

For further information, please contact the MoD Press Office on 0207 218 7907."

The Marines and the Afghan soldiers share Forward Operating Base (FOB) Shawqat from where they carry out patrols together and meet with the local people living nearby.

Captain Stuart Maccrimmon, the Adjutant of 45 Commando, said:

We work really long days, often in the blazing sun, so it can be really tiring and quite stressful. On the rare occasions we have a bit of spare time, the lads like to have a kick about or throw the ball around, but we noticed the Afghans were a bit reluctant to join in - think they were just confused about the rules.

So, Captain Maccrimmon and some of the Marines decided to train up the Afghans so they could take part. There was no shortage of volunteers from the ANA and over the last few weeks the soldiers have been getting to grips with the basics of passing, line-outs and scrums.

To make things a bit more interesting Captain Maccrimmon and his team organised a match between the Marines and the Afghan soldiers at FOB Shawqat.

Captain Maccrimmon says it got quite competitive:

The performance of the Afghans impressed us all, especially as they had never played or even watched rugby before. At first, we thought we’d better go easy on them, but had to change that tactic when we realised how good they were!

Despite all their coaching and determination, the ANA team didn’t manage to win the match. However, they have challenged the Marines to a game of cricket to try and even the score.

The shirts worn by the Royal Marines and the Afghan soldiers will be auctioned back in the UK to raise money for military charities."

Members of 1 Squadron RAF Regiment, normally based at RAF Honington, provided the inner security cordon for the event whilst the United States Marine Corps provided the outer cordon.

The ANA also provided a medic and search capability under the mentorship of the Danish Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team.

Female RAF Police personnel were used to supplement the Female Engagement Team (FET) that aims to engage direct with local female nationals.

Having previously engaged with local elders at a shura, permission was granted by the elders to enter the compounds and treat women and children.

A United States Marine Corps doctor accompanied the FET and treated 13 females, two males and 23 children within their compounds.

The male engagement was also highly successful, with 33 males and ten children being treated. A key aspect of the village medical outreach programme is providing direct medical aid to the local population.

Flight Lieutenant Steve Carroll met with local elders and chatted through some of the problems facing them. He said:

These types of outreach programmes are crucial in gaining the trust and respect of the local population. The key to success is undertaking them on their terms and we work hard to improve our relationship with them.

“Whilst we talked to them about security in their area as well as health and hygiene, we even found time to talk about the World Cup!”

Medication was provided and ancillary items such as toothbrushes and toothpaste were given out. In addition, training in preventative medicine and hygiene was also provided whilst the local nationals waited to be seen by the doctor.

Corporals Faye Stinton and Becky Lockhead of the Tactical Provost Wing, RAF Henlow, are relatively new arrivals to Bastion and normally work at the main entry point. This was their first trip into the local community and they were both slightly nervous prior to ‘travelling outside the wire’.

Corporal Stinton said:

Our role was to escort and search women and children before they saw the medical staff. The children certainly were characters and it was great to meet the local nationals.

Corporal Lockhead added:

Ultimately we are here to support the local population, and to meet them today and provide medical attention was very rewarding work.

The reality of the life of the people here is very different to what I was expecting; they were courteous, friendly and glad to receive the medical support that was offered.

I found the conversations [through the interpreter] amazing but I hope that one young boy was joking when he gave me the chance to be one of his future wives!

Building on the success of the day, Flight Lieutenant Carroll and his RAF Regiment and RAF Police colleagues will be participating in similar ventures in other parts of the local community soon.

He said the event truly highlighted the ISAF partnership:

The outreach programme requires co-operation and partnership from numerous organisations.

“This operation was led by the USMC; however, Afghan National Army, Danish and Royal Air Force personnel were vital to achieving the results on the day and highlights the true international approach to supporting the local population.”"

Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) are at the heart of NATO’s ISAF mission. Made up of military and civilian personnel, they embody a joint approach to stabilising Afghanistan. The UK-led PRT in Helmand is based in Lashkar Gah.

As the head of the Helmand PRT, Ms Cameron directed the international stabilisation and development work across the province, including some 200 civilian and military staff from the UK, the US, Denmark and Estonia. These personnel are deployed in ten district stabilisation teams throughout the province and provide civilian expertise and mentoring to their Afghan government counterparts, as well as managing development projects that directly benefit the Afghan population.

Speaking yesterday Ms Cameron contrasted the situation in Helmand province on her first visit in 2006, when insecurity, a devastated economy and unproductive governance plagued the province, with the progress she has witnessed over the past year.

She specifically cited the benefits of Governor Gulab Mangal’s leadership. He implemented the first merit-based selection of district governors as well as an effective alternative livelihoods programme. As a result, the people of Helmand have demonstrated a gradual shift in confidence in the Afghan Government. Recruitment to the civil service has increased, public debate has become more inclusive, and more individuals are willing to run for district community councils.

She also praised the efforts of the Afghan National Security Forces, as not a shot was fired within six kilometres of Helmand’s capital of Lashkar Gah during the recent parliamentary elections.

Instead of focusing on security, officials were able to focus on fighting fraud, with international experts playing a minimal role.

On progress in Marjah, Ms Cameron noted that ‘Marjah is making exactly the kind of progress we would expect it to’, particularly in light of the fact that the district started from a much lower baseline than anywhere else. Governance had to be built ‘from scratch’ and, while still a work in progress, she saw real evidence that the Government is making a difference during a visit there last week.

The focusing of resources on Marjah resulted in Afghan Government control of all the district centres in central Helmand, multiplying the positive impact on the population’s confidence."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hms-blyth-heads-up-black-sea-exercise,News story,HMS Blyth heads up Black Sea exercise,Clyde-based minehunter HMS Blyth recently led NATO operations in the Mediterranean and Black Sea after leaving her home port of Faslane at the end of June.,Ministry of Defence,14 August 2012,"The sophisticated Sandown Class vessel sailed over 3,000 miles (4,800km) to join an international fleet of mine clearance ships known as Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Group 2.

Consisting of four mine countermeasures vessels - Blyth together with the Italian ITS Milazzo, the Turkish TCG Edremit and the German FGS Sulzbach-Rosenberg - the group started their deployment with a two-week exercise in the Black Sea.

Known as Exercise Poseidon, the Black Sea operation saw the group joined by ships of both the Romanian and Bulgarian navies.

Taking command of the group was a chance for the Commanding Officer of HMS Blyth, Lieutenant Commander Tim Davey, and his team to maintain their fighting and warfare capabilities and work closely with allies.

Throughout the exercise the crews swapped members, allowing each of the navies to share their knowledge and culture, building on international relations:

It is a huge privilege to assume tactical command of such a capable force,” said Lt Cdr Davey.

We are looking forward to maximising the training opportunities with our NATO colleagues.

While in the area the ships visited Varna in Bulgaria and Constanta in Romania, strengthening ties in the region.

The exercise, although primarily about minehunting, also involved the task group coming under simulated attack by Romanian MiG-21 aircraft. The ships successfully saw off the mock attack before moving on to a joint search and rescue operation involving a human dummy being dropped from 100 feet (30m) by a Romanian military helicopter.

After conducting a careful search pattern it was HMS Blyth that spotted the dummy and successfully rescued it.

Next up for HMS Blyth and the group was a transit into Mediterranean waters to Izmir in Turkey. Here the task group bade farewell to one another, before Blyth negotiated the Corinth Canal on her way to the south of France.

HMS Blyth still has a lot of work ahead and is readying herself to receive three new NATO ships from the German, Italian and Turkish navies at the start of September.

Lt Cdr Davey said:

Now that Blyth is the command platform of the group, my team are under a lot more pressure to perform, but they have risen to the challenge and are doing an exceptional job."

Addressing the UK servicemen and women there, Mr Cameron said the crews involved had saved thousands of lives in Benghazi and other parts of Libya by preventing assaults by Colonel Gaddafi’s forces on civilians and rebel soldiers:

The whole country should be proud of what they have done,” he said. “They have responded incredibly quickly. They have flown many sorties. They have been extremely successful in holding back Gaddafi’s forces.

Just over the weekend, they have destroyed ten armoured vehicles and three tanks and they have flown a huge number of missions very rapidly and, as ever, very brilliantly.

Over the past few days, as part of the UK’s ongoing commitment to NATO to enforce UNSCR 1973, RAF aircraft have continued to carry out attacks on military targets in Libya and patrol the no-fly zone.

Yesterday, RAF Tornado GR4 jets, deployed from Gioia del Colle, engaged in two separate strikes in the Libyan city of Sirte, birthplace of Colonel Gaddafi, launching three Brimstone missiles which destroyed one main battle tank and two surface-to-air missile launchers.

This follows action for RAF Tornados over the weekend when RAF Typhoon aircraft also continued to patrol the no-fly zone.

On Saturday, RAF Tornado aircraft conducting a series of armed air reconnaissance and overwatch patrols over Libya launched Paveway IV missiles against military assets of pro-Gaddafi forces. Two main battle tanks in Sirte and several small ground attack aircraft on an airfield near Misurata were hit.

On Sunday, RAF Tornados again successfully launched attacks with Paveway IV and Brimstone missiles to target a group of ten armoured fighting vehicles south of Sirte.

During today’s visit, Mr Cameron announced the deployment of a further four RAF Tornado jets to Gioia del Colle to assist the military effort.

The additional aircraft are deploying to bolster the UK’s ground attack capability in support of the NATO-led operation. The first two Tornados arrived yesterday with the remaining aircraft due to join them later today.

Two of the original deployment of ten RAF Typhoons, which have been held in reserve to police the no-fly zone, have now returned to the UK. The return of these aircraft does not affect the UK’s contribution to the enforcement of UNSCR 1973."

But a radically improved security situation and an increasing return to normality in the area has now enabled the military base to be closed.

Instead of troops from The Royal Highland Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland (2 SCOTS), patrolling the streets of this area, total security responsibility has now been handed over to British-trained members of the Afghan National Police.

Checkpoint Tapa Paraang is the second checkpoint to be closed by 2 SCOTS in the space of a month and it is expected that more closures will follow.

In an effort to boost the local economy, the work to dismantle the checkpoint structures has been contracted to a local firm. Once their work is complete, the previously existing compounds will be returned to their original state and handed back to their previous owners.

Major Tristan Winfield, Officer Commanding B Company, 2 SCOTS, whose men ran Checkpoint Tapa Paraang, said:

Important work was done from this checkpoint, work which had a big positive impact on the lives of people living in the area. But with the increased level of security that is now being provided by Afghan forces here, there is no need to keep it open.

The Afghan National Police [ANP] in the Bolan district are extremely competent and able to provide security for the local people. Under the direction of the local commander, Major Israel, order is maintained and insurgent activity is tackled.

It is good that the ANP have reached a level of skill and competence that allows them to operate independently. We are moving irreversibly toward an Afghan-led solution to the problems of Afghanistan.

Earlier this month, Helmand’s Police Training Centre reached a major milestone, with the graduation of its 2,000th recruit. There are currently around 116,000 fully-trained Afghan National Police in Afghanistan and the aim is to reach a target of 134,000 by the end of 2011."

The additional security measures build on the RAF’s existing air security arrangements, with RAF Typhoon fighter jets available 24/7 to be scrambled from their bases in Lincolnshire and Scotland to intercept unidentified aircraft.

Personnel and aircrew from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire and RAF Leuchars in Scotland have been preparing for their Olympics role for many months, and have already taken part in a series of demanding training missions; working alongside RAF helicopters, ground-based radar controllers and colleagues from the other Services.

Squadron Leader Gordon Lovett, who is leading the detachment of four aircraft whilst at their temporary home at RAF Northolt, said:

The aircraft flying into RAF Northolt over London today reminded all of us of how important our mission is to ensure a safe and enjoyable Games for everyone.

On behalf of the RAF, we are really proud to be able to make this contribution.

This is the first time that RAF fighter aircraft have conducted live operations from the historic West London airfield since the Second World War, when RAF Northolt played a key role in securing London’s skies.

RAF Northolt will also host Royal Navy Sea King helicopters as part of the multi-layered air defence plan, which also includes RAF E-3D Sentry surveillance aircraft, sniper-carrying helicopters, RAF ground-based radar systems, and Army air defence missile systems, which will operate in support of the Department for Transport and Civil Aviation Authority airspace restrictions and the overall Home Office security plan.

Air Commodore Gary Waterfall, Deputy Commander for Olympics Air Security, said:

This deployment to an airfield with an historic role in defending London is a reminder that our air security preparations build on the decades of Royal Air Force experience in controlling the air to protect the UK.

There is no specific threat to the Games, but we have to be ready for all eventualities. With the additional capabilities we are adding from the RAF, and from our colleagues in the Royal Navy and the Army, this is a robust plan that enables us to respond appropriately to a range of possible situations."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/engineers-receive-afghanistan-campaign-medals,News story,Engineers receive Afghanistan campaign medals,Soldiers from 32 Engineer Regiment have been presented with their campaign medals after a demanding six-month tour in Afghanistan.,Ministry of Defence,20 October 2011,"During the tour the soldiers provided engineering support to the NATO-led mission to prepare the Afghans to fully take over the security of their own country.

The 330 soldiers, who are part of 7th Armoured Brigade, better known as the Desert Rats, supported 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines during the tour and were based in Lashkar Gah and Nahr-e Saraj between March and September 2011.

They were instrumental in constructing and upgrading tactical infrastructure for the teams of British soldiers who were preparing the Afghan National Security Forces for transition in Helmand province.

Personnel were primarily involved in the construction and upgrade of forward operating bases and military checkpoints and also cleared convoy routes by detecting and destroying hidden improvised explosive devices.

Sapper Leonid Remizov, who is originally from Russia but moved to Lincoln when he was 14, received his medal along with the rest of the regiment at a special ceremony at his barracks in Bergen-Hohne in northern Germany.

He said:

I was based at a checkpoint near Lashkar Gah. It was a really good tour, I helped build checkpoints and upgraded some of our facilities. I’d do it again, definitely, but it was a lot of hard work. It was hot and dusty.

We are helping the Afghans to rebuild their country; one of our biggest projects was to build a new bridge which a lot of locals came to watch. They were really happy about it as the bridge will really help them in their daily lives.

Sapper Remizov, who joined the Army in 2007 and completed a variety of training exercises in Germany, the UK, Canada and the Falkland Islands in the run up to his tour, added:

I met and spoke with a lot of Afghans while I was out there and we got on pretty well.

Arriving back home after the tour was a big weight off our shoulders; it is nice to come back and relax for a change. It was my first operational tour and it was a really proud moment to receive my medal.

The parade, which was watched by the families and friends of the soldiers, also included music from the Band of the Irish Guards.

Addressing the soldiers during the ceremony, Major General James Bashall, General Officer Commanding of Germany-based 1 (UK) Armoured Division, who presented the medals, said:

For most of us there are moments in our careers that are memorable and special. For all of you I hope this is a memorable day; I would like to thank you for your work in Afghanistan.

We are making progress in Afghanistan but that progress is not always glamorous and some jobs don’t receive much publicity, but it is essential nonetheless. The work you did in Afghanistan is saving lives.

The regiment should have a real sense of pride and achievement but we are nothing without our families; we must remember and thank our families whose support has been fantastic.

The men and women of 32 Engineer Regiment will now begin over four weeks of well-deserved leave before returning to their barracks to begin training for their next mission."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/innovative-approach-to-farming-recovery-fund-helps-reopen-curry-and-hay-moors-on-the-somerset-levels,Press release,Innovative approach to Farming Recovery Fund helps reopen Curry and Hay Moors on the Somerset Levels,The western edge of Curry and Hay Moor Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) on the Somerset Levels has reopened for farming with the support of a grant from Defra’s Farming Recovery Fund to local farmers.,Natural England,10 September 2014,"The area’s farmers have been working with Natural England and Defra to secure funding for the renovation of the drove at Curry Moor after it was rendered impassable to machinery following last winter’s flooding.

The drove provides essential access for haymaking, silaging and for the livestock that grazes Curry and Hay MoorSSSI. As well as being a farmed landscape, the area is designated as aSSSIfor its internationally important numbers of overwintering wading birds, such as lapwing and snipe.

As no single farmer owns the drove and no individual farmer could afford to pay a contractor up-front, applying for funding from theFarm Recovery Fund (FRF)brought complications not previously faced in the Somerset Levels farm flood recovery work. Working with Natural England’s local adviser, Claire Stride, and the FRF team, the solution was for the farmers to submit an innovative ‘communal’ application to the fund.

Local farmer, Richard Kearn, agreed to be the lead applicant for the collective application and was delighted that the application resulted in a grant of £74,700 from the Recovery Fund to support the essential works.

Mr Kearn said: “The drove repair was a significant project because the total length of the drove is about 2,262 metres and a regular stream of heavy lorry loads of stone was needed to repair the worst of the damage caused by the flooding.  I would like to say thank you to anyone inconvenienced during the works for their patience and also thank Claire Stride and Natural England for all their support.”

Andrew Sells, the Chairman of Natural England added: “Natural England is very proud of the farmers who graze their stock on Curry and Hay Moor and of the work that they do on the site, which makes an invaluable contribution to the management of theSSSI.

“Following the winter’s flooding farmers faced the possibility of being unable to access their fields, but I’m pleased we were able to find a solution that worked for everyone and ensured that farming operations could quickly return to business as usual.”

Farming Minister George Eustice said: “The local community has really got behind this project to get livestock back on Curry and Hay Moor where they will continue to support the management of one of our most valuable natural habitats. Our Farming Recovery Fund is helping hundreds of farmers across the country to repair damage caused by last year’s floods and get their businesses back on track.”

The funding provided to restore the drove under the Farming Recovery Fund has been welcomed by the local community and has proved to be an excellent example of flexible partnership working between farmers, Natural England and Defra.

The process can now be repeated on other sites in the area, such as Wet Moor, helping to save farmers time and money and ensuring that some of the best wildlife sites in the area can continue to be managed successfully for farming and wildlife.

The Somerset Levels and Moors is a wetland area spanning around 29,000ha of the River Parrett Catchment and the River Brue Valley in Somerset. It is the largest area of lowland wet grassland in the UK.

Natural England currently invests around £2.2 million per annum in the Somerset Levels through payments to farmers under Defra’s Environmental Stewardship scheme. We currently have Higher Level Stewardship agreements with 325 land managers worth £2.2 million per annum.

Approximately 7,000ha of the lowest lying areas are designated as 14SSSI. Of this 6,300ha (12 of theSSSI) are designated as internationally important wetland (Special Protection Area/Ramsar) for migratory wildfowl under the Habitats Directive and Ramsar Convention.  The designations are the result of conservation concerns which arose as a result of increased drainage and agricultural intensification from the 1950s to the 1980s.

Curry and Hay Moor is the first moor on the Somerset Levels to be flooded in the winter months and the last to be drained due to its position along the River Tone. Normally dry during the summer months, it was badly flooded in the summer of 2012 resulting in the loss of thousands of acres of grassland and substantial costs to the farmers to reseed the land.

There are 4,129 SSSIs in England, covering around 8 per cent of the country, many of which cover the most loved, and often visited, parts of England. The aim for every site is to achieve an assessment of favourable condition, which means that the specific features for which a site is notified have reached nationally recognised goals for habitat quality or species abundance. EachSSSIis unique and aSSSIcan be notified for its important natural habitat, distinctive species of wildlife, or for an exceptional geological formation."

He also announced that self-employed army, navy and airforce reservists who are currently ineligible for the Self Employment Income Support Scheme as a result of their service will be able to access a grant.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak MP said:

Reservists embody the best of our nation – in our hours of need, they rise up to the challenge and leave their everyday lives behind to serve our people.

It is only right that we do everything we can to support them when they return to civilian life during these challenging times.

To enable the introduction of more flexible, part-time furloughing, and support those already furloughed back to work,CJRSclaims from July onwards will be restricted to employers currently using the scheme and previously furloughed employees.

However, as some reservists will have been in active service during the outbreak and will be returning to work after this cut-off point, they have been exempted from the restriction - providing they work for an employer who has previously furloughed employees.

TheCJRShas so far helped 1 million employers across the UK furlough almost 9 million jobs, and the SEISS has seen 2.6 million claims submitted with a total value of £7.5 billion.

More details of the changes will be included in updated guidance, published next week.

Reservists who currently cannot access the SEISS as a direct result of their service in 2018-19 will be able to make a claim for both the first and second SEISS grants, and further information on how to do this will be published shortly."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sizewell-c-starts-private-investment-process,Press release,Sizewell C starts private investment process,Government opens process for partners to express interest in investing in nuclear revival.,"Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, The Rt Hon Claire Coutinho MP and Andrew Bowie MP",18 September 2023,"Private investors will have their first chance to come forward and qualify to invest in Sizewell C power station, a key component of the UK’s nuclear revival, from today (Monday 18 September).

Today, the Energy Security Secretary Claire Coutinho confirmed the next stage for the investment process – opening applications for partners to register their interest in being part of the project.

The government, the Sizewell C Company and EDF, the project’s lead developer, are looking for companies with substantial experience in the delivery of major infrastructure projects. This builds on engagement undertaken as the Sizewell C project has developed.

Any investment will also be subject to strict national security checks.

Sizewell C is expected to house 2 of the most powerful nuclear reactors in the world.  It will generate reliable, low-carbon power for up to 6 million homes over 60 years, avoiding 9 million tonnes of carbon each year. At peak construction, it is expected to support 10,000 jobs across the country.

In a show of support, the government has already invested £700 million in the project – the first such direct public investment in a nuclear project for a generation. Ministers have also made £511 million available to continue project development and prepare the Suffolk site for construction, ahead of the planned private equity raise for the project in advance.

The government is delivering a revival of nuclear power by investing in large scale reactors as well as emerging technologies, such as Small Modular Reactors, with the ambition of having up to a quarter of the UK’s electricity generated by nuclear by 2050.

Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, Claire Coutinho, said:

Investing in Sizewell C is an exciting opportunity to be a part of the UK’s nuclear revival - delivering clean, reliable, and affordable power for generations to come.

This project will create thousands of jobs, power 6 million homes and will boost our energy security.

We are focused on securing good value for taxpayers and look forward to seeing strong and competitive bids to be a part of this exciting project.

Sizewell C Company Joint Managing Director, Julia Pyke, said:

The launch of the formal equity raise opens another exciting phase for the project, following a positive response from investors during market testing.

Investors who participate in Sizewell C would be contributing to one of the biggest clean energy projects in the UK.  They should feel confident in our proposals as we are building a replica project with government backing, a mature reactor design and a workforce ready to build it.

We look forward to starting the main site construction and delivering this vital project which will reduce costs for consumers and help to create a future-proof low-carbon energy system for Britain.

The initial process launched today invites partners to complete a pre-qualification assessment. Companies will have to demonstrate that they meet the key criteria for entering negotiations on a potential equity stake in Sizewell C, including experience in delivering major infrastructure projects.

The process has been designed following market testing with a cross-section of partners.

While details of the investors who come forward and get involved cannot be provided at this stage given the need for commercial confidentiality, ministers will be looking for private investors who can add value to the project and will only accept private investment if it provides value for money, while bolstering energy security.

Minister for Nuclear and Networks, Andrew Bowie, said:

Sizewell C is at the heart of the UK’s nuclear revival and our ambition to provide up to a quarter of the UK’s electricity from homegrown nuclear energy by 2050.

This will provide reliable and abundant energy, boost economic growth and jobs across the country and underpin the UK’s path to Net Zero.

Following the first government direct public investment in a nuclear project for a generation, I look forward to seeing strong and competitive bids from potential investors to bring new expertise and experience into the company to help deliver this critical piece of national infrastructure.

CEO of EDF Energy, Simone Rossi, said:

EDF is pleased to support the development of the Sizewell C nuclear plant and the launch of this equity raise.

The very significant investment that EDF continues to make in Britain at Hinkley Point C benefits Sizewell C through replication of the design and construction, and a proven UK supply chain.

Together, Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C will be the bedrock of Britain’s new nuclear fleet, a critical part of ensuring Britain has the clean, affordable energy it needs.

Alongside support for Sizewell C at Suffolk, and Hinkley Point C in Somerset, the government has also launched Great British Nuclear, which will further drive the UK’s nuclear revival through the development of new and emerging technologies.

This includes Small Modular Reactors, which can be constructed more quickly having been partially built in factories; and Advanced Modular Reactors, which are also smaller and can generate high temperatures which can help power industry.

Companies in the UK are already winning more than £7 billion of work annually from vehicle makers. But there are clear opportunities to grow this business.

Using data collected from vehicle manufacturers and supply chain companies, the report identifies the opportunities with a new purchasing wish list of interior and exterior vehicle parts from manufacturers.

The main categories with untapped potential are:

The study also looks at issues holding UK suppliers back. In addition to pinpointing new work that manufacturers would like to source from the UK, the report also identifies that, contrary to popular belief, even lost contracts, need not necessarily be lost for ever.

The report was launched today by Vince Cable during a visit to Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and supply chain company International Automotive Components (IAC) in Halewood, Merseyside.

Vince Cable welcomed today’s news that JLR’s Evoque, which starts production in July backed by a government offer of support of up to £26 million, has resulted in supply chain contracts worth £2 billion being awarded to 40 manufacturers across the UK.

In addition, JLR are creating 1,500 apprenticeship places at Halewood to build the Evoque. It is expected that the contracts announced today will generate a further 5,000 new jobs in the supply chain.

Dr Cable, who also co-chairs the Automotive Council, said:

“JLR’s news that it’s awarding £2 billion worth of contracts to businesses in the UK to supply components for the Evoque shows that the UK automotive supply chain is capable of winning major contracts and creating vital jobs in the UK.

“Today’s Automotive Council report shows for the first time, where the opportunities are, the parts that vehicle manufacturers want to source here in the UK if they have the choice, and where the UK has capability to supply those parts.”"

Around 1 in 3 people with coronavirus don’t have symptoms, which means they could be spreading the virus in workplaces without knowing. Rapid testing detects cases quickly – in under 30 minutes – meaning positive cases can isolate immediately, breaking chains of transmission.

Regular testing could be the difference between a workplace being able to stay open and operational, or needing to close due to a COVID-19 outbreak. It will form a crucial part of the government’s plan to gradually and safely ease restrictions as we get back to a more normal life.

So far over 3,500 businesses are signed up to offer workplace testing programmes, and over 14,000 have registered their interest in offering rapid testing, with many already rolling tests out.

Businesses have until 31 March to register for the government’s workplace testing scheme, which will remain free until the end of June. All those who can work from home should continue to do so.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said:

Regular workplace testing is a vital part of our route back to normal life, which is why I’m very pleased that we’re now expanding our offer of free workplace testing to businesses of all sizes, including SMEs.

These rapid tests will allows positive cases of Covid-19 to be caught quickly, which is crucial in helping businesses protect their workplaces and employees as we cautiously lift restrictions.

I urge all businesses to register their interest in the programme before 31 March to help break chains of transmission and keep people safe.

Dr Susan Hopkins, COVID-19 Strategic Response Director to PHE and Chief Medical Adviser to NHS Test and Trace:

Around one in three people who have coronavirus never show any symptoms but may still be infectious. This means they could be spreading the virus without realising it.

Rapid testing can help detect asymptomatic cases quickly, preventing the virus from entering workplaces and stopping outbreaks before they occur.

Combined with other protective measures, rapid testing is a vital tool to help us lower infection rates and ensure that they stay low. If you’re offered a test, please do take it.

Federation of Small Business Chairman Mike Cherry said:

A workplace testing infrastructure that works for businesses of all sizes as well as consumers is fundamental to bringing the coronavirus under control and ensuring that this current lockdown is the last. It’s great to see that the smallest businesses can now apply to set-up testing facilities on their premises.

It’s vital that they are given all the support they need to do so successfully as they focus on staying afloat in extremely changing circumstances. We’d encourage all small firms that would benefit from a testing facility to apply as swiftly as they can.

Confederation of British Industry Chief UK Policy Director Matthew Fell, said:

Enabling more companies to engage with workplace testing is good news. It will help protect workers and help stifle Covid transmission. Businesses appreciate that regular mass testing can play a vital role in a safe re-opening, helping to build staff confidence and adding a layer of resilience to help firms stay open.

The CBI will continue to work with our members and with government to ensure firms have the knowledge and support they need to engage with testing opportunities. Increasing take-up will be vital if we are to meet the timetable set out in the Prime Minister’s roadmap and safely loosen restrictions for summer.

Alongside the roll out of the vaccination programme and following the ‘Hands, Face, Space’, regular testing is a vital tool to stop transmission as sections of society are reopened.

The expansion of asymptomatic testing is already well underway in larger companies for those who need to leave home for work. Both private and public sector employers have signed up to provide rapid testing at asymptomatic testing sites, along with a self-test option for those that cannot access a workplace testing site. This includes the UK’s largest employer – the NHS, those working in adult social care, education staff and a wide range of other sectors.

Anonline portalhas been launched for businesses to find out more about offering rapid workplace testing. Businesses will be provided with all the information they need to plan and deliver their testing programme, along with promotional materials.

All local authorities in England are now offering rapid lateral flow testing for small businesses if they can’t offer rapid workplace testing. Businesses can find their local test siteonline.

You canread guidance on what to do if you have symptoms of COVID-19 or a positive test result.

From Monday 17 January, people with COVID-19 in England can end their self-isolation after 5 full days, as long as they test negative on day 5 and day 6.

The decision has been made after careful consideration of modelling from the UK Health Security Agency and to support essential public services and workforces over the winter.

It is crucial that people isolating with COVID-19 wait until they have received 2 negative rapid lateral flow tests on 2 consecutive days to reduce the chance of still being infectious.

The first test must be taken no earlier than day 5 of the self-isolation period, and the second must be taken the following day. If an individual is positive on day 5, then a negative test is required on day 6 and day 7 to release from isolation.

It is essential that 2 negative rapid lateral flow tests are taken on consecutive days and reported before individuals return to their job or education, if leaving self-isolation earlier than the full 10-day period.

For instance, if an individual is positive on day 5, then a negative test is required on both day 6 and day 7 to release from self-isolation, or positive on day 6, then a negative test is required on days 7 and 8, and so on until the end of day 10.

Those who leave self-isolation on or after day 6 are strongly advised to wear face coverings and limit close contact with other people in crowded or poorly ventilated spaces, work from home if they can do so and minimise contact with anyone who is at higher risk of severe illness if infected with COVID-19.

The default self-isolation period continues to be 10 days, and you may only leave self-isolation early if you have taken 2 rapid lateral flow tests and do not have a temperature in line with guidance.

Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said:

After reviewing all of the evidence, we’ve made the decision to reduce the minimum self-isolation period to 5 full days in England.

These 2 tests are critical to these balanced and proportionate plans and I’d urge everyone to take advantage of the capacity we’ve built up in tests so we can restore more freedom to this country, whilst we are keeping everyone safe.

Existing public health measures remain in place, including:

Self-isolation may continue in certain circumstances, such as for those who work with vulnerable people. A full list will be published in guidance in due course.

Vaccinations remain our best defence against COVID-19, offering substantial protection against infection and hospitalisation –  and the government continues to urge the public to get boosted as soon as you’re eligible.

In line with today’s announcement, the government will also consider the guidance for close contacts of people with COVID-19, including around the advice for fully vaccinated contacts to take daily rapid lateral flow tests for 7 days.

Under the current testing rules, around 6% of people will be infectious when they are released from isolation on day 7 following 2 consecutive negative rapid lateral flow tests.

Once the guidance is changed to end isolation on day 6 with 2 consecutive negative rapid lateral flow results, modelling from the UK Health Security Agency shows this figure will rise to around 7%.

If you leave isolation on day 6, after 5 full days of isolation, between 20% and 30% of people are still infectious.

The percentage of those released while infectious is reduced to around 7% if people have 2 consecutive negative tests and then leave isolation from day 6.

The self-isolation period was previously reduced from ending on day 10 to day 7, with a negative rapid lateral flow test result taken 24 hours apart on day 6 and 7 on 22 December 2021.

Individuals may only leave isolation once they have had 2 negative rapid lateral flow tests on 2 consecutive days; if they test positive on day 5, 6 or 7, they must continue testing until they have 2 negative tests.

If you test positive for COVID-19 you must self-isolate, it is the law. The law states that you must self-isolate for 10 days, however this change enables people who are not infectious, proven via 2 negative tests over 2 days, which can start from day 5, to leave isolation on day 6.

If individuals test positive during their isolation period it does not restart the clock for the 10-day isolation period. Day 0 of the isolation period is when you first show symptoms or, if asymptomatic, the day you took your test.

The rules for contacts have not changed. Fully vaccinated individuals who are identified as contacts of someone with COVID-19 should take daily rapid lateral flow tests for 7 days but are not legally required to self-isolate. Unvaccinated contacts are legally required to self-isolate for the full 10-day period."

In total, these schemes have provided almost £180 billion worth of lending to date, supporting over a quarter of businesses in the UK. The CCFF alone has directly supported firms that employ almost 2.5 million people in the UK, including those in the car industry, travel, hospitality, and high street stores.

I said we would do whatever it takes to protect jobs and livelihoods and that is exactly what we have done.

I’m delighted that our Bounce Back Loan scheme worked so effectively that it issued three loans every minute since its launch last May. That means every 20 seconds a hardworking small business owner benefited from this support.

We’ll continue to protect jobs through our new Recovery Loan Scheme – part of our wider Plan for Jobs – as we move out of this crisis.

1.6 million small businesses have now been helped to keep going through an awful year by securing Bounce back loans. As the unlock takes place, the economic recovery will rely on the successor scheme to fire on all cylinders.

[As of 21 March 2021]

CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS close for new applications next week (31 March 2021). A new Recovery Loan Scheme will open to applications on Tuesday 6 April to ensure support is still available for those who still need it.

The Recovery Loan Scheme will run until 31 December 2021 and will ensure lenders continue to have the confidence to provide support, and viable businesses can access Government-backed finance throughout 2021 following the disruption of the pandemic.

The CCFF also closed to new issuance from 23 March 2021. It will continue to provide finance for firms with outstanding loans in the scheme until March 2022 at the latest.

A further £1.12 billion of funding has been provided to 1,140 high growth firms through the Future Fund. This scheme, which closed on the 31st January, was designed to support innovative UK companies that typically rely on equity investment and whose access to investment was affected by Covid-19. The new Future Fund: Breakthrough scheme will launch in early summer of 2021.

The Recovery Loan Scheme operates UK-wide, providing an 80% guarantee to lenders for term loans, overdrafts, and invoice and asset finance. The maximum loan size across all products is £10 million; the minimum loan size is £25,000 for term loans and overdrafts, and £1,000 for invoice and asset finance.

Once received, the finance can be used for any legitimate business purpose, including growth and investment. The scheme will be administered by the British Business Bank via a diverse network of accredited commercial lenders. Any business trading in the UK is eligible to apply, and applicants will need to demonstrate to lenders that they are viable (or would be were it not for the pandemic) and have been impacted by the pandemic.

*The value of BBLS facilities approved includes BBLS loans which have been ‘topped-up. One topped up loan will still be reported as one loan to avoid double counting the number of facilities approved.

**The approved value refers to the total credit line for all 304 eligible firms, which peaked at c. £104bn. The total issued into the scheme by 107 firms was c. £38bn."

More than 100 of the UK’s leading investors were present, including representatives of Hutchison Whampoa, Motorola, Tata Group, Toyota, Siemens, Emirates, Fujitsu and Pfizer.

The event coincided with the release of national investment figures for 2009/10, which showed:

The Prime Minister David Cameron called for a big change in how the UK valued foreign investment. He said:

“What we are discussing today is probably the most important subject facing this country because we are coming out of a very deep and difficult recession, growth is fragile, and it is absolutely vital for our country that we attract the maximum amount of inward investment and that we do everything we can to demonstrate that the British economy is open for business, open for trade, open for investment.”

Business Secretary Vince Cable said:

“Inward investment is crucial to the success of the UK’s economy. It creates thousands of jobs for the country and is key to the economic growth of our regions.

“I know how attractive the UK is for doing business. That’s why I’m so pleased that today I can meet with such vital international companies to encourage them to keep bringing business to Britain.”

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/access-agreements-for-universities,News story,Access agreements for universities,Final details of the fees universities will charge next year are released today by the Office for Fair Access.,"Department for Business, Innovation & Skills and The Rt Hon Dr Vince Cable",12 July 2011,"The Office for Fair Access (OFFA) has today announced it has approved 2012-13 Access Agreements for 139 institutions - 123 higher education institutions and 16 further education colleges.

It also announced that English universities and colleges charging above £6,000 for their courses plan to boost their spending on access measures to £602 million a year by 2015-16, up from £407 million in 2011-12.

This figure rises to £738 million a year when the Government’s contribution to the National Scholarship Programme (NSP) is included.

Read OFFA’s announcement in full.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said:

“The Government is determined that no-one with the ambition and ability, whatever their background, should face barriers to accessing higher education.

“Progress over the past few years in securing fair access to the most selective universities has been inadequate. Only around 40 pupils out of the 80,000 on free school meals currently make it to Oxbridge at the moment.

“The government therefore tasked OFFA with setting more demanding tests than in previous years. We are satisfied that universities and colleges are showing their determination to improve. Indeed, by 2015, we expect the sector’s investment in access to be more than £600m.

“We will be monitoring performance on fair access closely every year to ensure we see tangible progress in opening the doors of our universities to the most disadvantaged.”

Universities and Science Minister David Willetts went on to say:

“We told universities to be much more ambitious with their plans for attracting people from low income backgrounds in exchange for charging students more. This will result in a step change in social mobility with university investment in programmes such as summer schools, scholarships and fee waivers reaching more than £600 million annually by 2015.

“The majority of students will not be paying £9,000. No one should be put off going to university for financial reasons. No first time undergraduate will have to pay up front costs and there is a very generous package of financial support. Graduates will make lower monthly repayments than they do now.”"
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-outlines-plans-to-help-cut-energy-bills-for-businesses,Press release,Government outlines plans to help cut energy bills for businesses,"Support for households, businesses and public sector organisations facing rising energy bills has been unveiled.","Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, HM Treasury, Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street, The Rt Hon Elizabeth Truss, The Rt Hon Jacob Rees-Mogg and The Rt Hon Kwasi Kwarteng",21 September 2022,"New support for households, businesses and public sector organisations facing rising energy bills in Great Britain and Northern Ireland has been unveiled by Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg today (Wednesday 21 September) – supporting growth, preventing unnecessary insolvencies and protecting jobs.

Through a new governmentEnergy Bill Relief Scheme, the government will provide a discount on wholesale gas and electricity prices for all non-domestic customers (including all UK businesses, the voluntary sector like charities and the public sector such as schools and hospitals) whose current gas and electricity prices have been significantly inflated in light of global energy prices. This support will be equivalent to theEnergy Price Guaranteeput in place for households.

It will apply to fixed contracts agreed on or after 1 April 2022, as well as to deemed, variable and flexible tariffs and contracts. It will apply to energy usage from 1 October 2022 to 31 March 2023, running for an initial 6 month period for all non-domestic energy users. The savings will be first seen in October bills, which are typically received in November.

As with the Energy Price Guarantee for households, customers do not need to take action or apply to the scheme to access the support. Support (in the form of a p/kWh discount) will automatically be applied to bills.

To administer support, the government has set a Supported Wholesale Price – expected to be £211 perMWhfor electricity and £75 perMWhfor gas, less than half the wholesale prices anticipated this winter – which is a discounted price per unit of gas and electricity. This is equivalent to the wholesale element of the Energy Price Guarantee for households. It includes the removal of green levies paid by non-domestic customers who receive support under the scheme.

The level of price reduction for each business will vary depending on their contract type and circumstances:

A parallel scheme, based on the same criteria and offering comparable support, but recognising the different market fundamentals, will be established in Northern Ireland.

If you are not connected to either the gas or electricity grid, equivalent support will also be provided for non-domestic consumers who use heating oil or alternative fuels instead of gas. Further detail on this will be announced shortly.

We will publish a review into the operation of the scheme in three months to inform decisions on future support after March 2023. The review will focus in particular on identifying the most vulnerable non-domestic customers and how the government will continue assisting them with energy costs.

Prime Minister Liz Truss said:

I understand the huge pressure businesses, charities and public sector organisations are facing with their energy bills, which is why we are taking immediate action to support them over the winter and protect jobs and livelihoods.

As we are doing for consumers, our new scheme will keep their energy bills down from October, providing certainty and peace of mind.

At the same time, we are boosting Britain’s homegrown energy supply so we fix the root cause of the issues we are facing and ensure greater energy security for us all.

Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng said:

We have stepped in to stop businesses collapsing, protect jobs, and limit inflation.

And with our plans to boost home-grown energy supply, we will bring security to the sector, growth to the economy and secure a better deal for consumers.

Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg said:

We have seen an unprecedented rise in energy prices following Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine, which has affected consumers up and down the country and businesses of all sizes.

The help we are already putting in place will save families money off their bills, and the government’s plans for businesses, charities and public sector organisations will give them the equivalent level of support.

This, alongside the measures we are taking to boost the amount of domestic energy we produce to improve both energy security and supply, will increase growth, protect jobs and support families with their cost of living this winter.

Kate Nicholls, CEO of UKHospitality said:

This intervention is unprecedented and it is extremely welcome that government has listened to hospitality businesses facing an uncertain winter. We particularly welcome its inclusiveness – from the smallest companies to the largest - all of which combine to provide a huge number of jobs, which are now much more secure.

The government has recognised the vulnerability of hospitality as a sector, and we will continue to work with the government, to ensure that there is no cliff edge when these measures fall away.

Today’s announcement follows the launch of the Energy Price Guarantee for households in Great Britain, under which a typical household will pay on average £2,500 a year on their energy bill for the next two years from 1 October.

The scheme limits the price suppliers can charge customers for units of gas and electricity, taking account of the Exchequer temporarily funding for two years environmental and social costs, including green levies – worth around £150 – which are currently included in domestic energy bills. The guarantee supersedes the existing price cap and is expected to save the average household £1,000 a year based on current energy prices from October.

It also comes in addition to the announced £400 energy bills discount for all households and together, they will bring costs close to where the energy price cap currently stands.

Today, the Business Secretary also confirmed equivalent support for households in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Energy Price Guarantee will offer households the same level of gas and electricity bill support as the equivalent scheme in Great Britain.

Households in Northern Ireland will also receive a £400 discount on bills through the Northern Ireland Energy Bills Support Scheme (NIEBSS), the same support as is available in Great Britain.

For the Energy Price Guarantee, the scheme will still work through electricity and gas bills. The scheme will provide households in Northern Ireland with equivalent financial support with their electricity and gas bills as for those in Great Britain. Energy suppliers will reduce bills by a unit price reduction of up to 17p/kWh for electricity and 4.2p/kWh for gas, and there is no need to take any action to receive this support. This will take effect from November, but the government will ensure households receive support so they will see the same benefit overall as those households in Great Britain backdating support for October bills through bills from November.

The government also announced today further details on the separateEnergy Bills Support Scheme (EBSS)to ensure that the £400 discount to households starting from October will also be available to the 1% of households who would not otherwise have received this support.

Additional funding will be made available so that £400 payments will be extended to include people such as park home residents and those tenants whose landlords pay for their energy via a commercial contract. The government is committed to ensuring such households receive the same support for their energy bills.  The government will introduce legislation to make sure landlords pass theEBSSdiscount on to tenants who pay all-inclusive bills.

The government will also provide an additional payment of £100 to households across the UK who are not able to receive support for their heating costs through the Energy Price Guarantee. This might be because they live in an area of the UK that is not served by the gas grid and is to compensate for the rising costs of alternative fuels such as heating oil.

A pub uses 4MWhof electricity and 16MWhof gas a month. They signed a fixed contract in August 2022, giving them a current monthly energy bill of about £7,000. At the time they signed their contact, wholesale prices for the next 6 months were expected to be higher than the Government Supported Price of £211/MWhfor electricity, and £75/MWhfor gas, meaning they can receive support under this scheme.

The difference between expected wholesale prices when they signed their contract and the Government Supported Price is worth £380/MWhfor electricity and £100/MWhfor gas, meaning they receive a discount of £3,100 per month, reducing their bill by over 40%.

A school uses 10MWhof electricity and 22MWhof gas a month. They signed a fixed contract in July 2022, giving them a current monthly energy bill of about £10,000. At the time they signed their contact, wholesale prices for the next 6 months were expected to be higher than the Government Supported Price of £211/MWhfor electricity, and £75/MWhfor gas, meaning they can receive support under this scheme.

The difference between expected wholesale prices when they signed their contract and the Government Supported Price is worth £240/MWhfor electricity and £70/MWhfor gas, meaning they receive a discount of £4,000 per month, reducing their original bill by 40%.

The government will conduct a review of the government Energy Bill Relief Scheme, to be published in 3 months’ time, to assess:

Martin McTague, National Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said:

Small businesses called for decisive action – now the government is delivering. With small firms the least able to avoid closure and 16 million employees relying on them, Ministers have listened to our community and got this big call right. Now it’s up to energy retailers to live up to the high bar set today and make sure this help reaches those on the ground.

Jonathan Geldart, Director General of the Institute of Directors, said:

This is an important intervention by the government and provides much needed short-term reassurance for the numerous firms that are facing soaring energy bills. We look forward to working with the government in the coming months to ensure that further relief is targeted at those industries and sectors whose survival is most threatened by current economic conditions.

Ultimately, however, business and government will need to work hand in hand to develop domestic energy sources and reduce consumption and dependency on expensive fossil fuels.

Anthony Impey, CEO of Be the Business, said:

This package of support will give business owners the confidence to take long term investment decisions, which many have been postponing in response to rising prices.

They can now focus their efforts on activities that drive growth and productivity, such as adoption of technology and increasing the skills of their employees and management teams.

James Lowman, Chief Executive, Association of Convenience Stores, said:

We strongly welcome the government’s support package which will provide a lifeline for thousands of local shops, enabling them to keep trading and serving their communities.

We will continue to work closely with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy on longer term solutions to the energy crisis facing convenience stores and other businesses, including ways to incentivise investment in energy efficient technology.

The Food and Drink Federation CEO Karen Betts said:

We welcome the scope of the government’s Energy Bill Relief Scheme and the speed with which it’s being rolled out.  It addresses the largest and most volatile cost pressure facing our industry right now. Although some aspects of the scheme are still to be clarified, it offers relief to food and drink manufacturers across the UK.

Stephen Phipson CEO of Make UK, the manufacturers’ organisation said:

Industry will warmly welcome the timely announcement of an energy price cap for an initial 6 months for all business users. Government has delivered a scheme which is simple to understand, giving reassurance to the business sector. However as appear prices will likely remain high for many months to come, industry will need support for a longer period to protect jobs and remain competitive, so the further announcement of a review on future support at the 3 month stage is reassuring.

We hope that this support can be made tangible as quickly as possible and not applied retrospectively at the end of the next quarter."

We have a unique opportunity to make a real difference to people’s lives.

Commenting on Andy’s appointment, the Cabinet Secretary, Simon Case, said:

I would like to congratulate Andy on his appointment. Andy brings with him a wealth of experience and insight from his distinguished career at the Bank of England and in academia. I am very grateful that he has agreed to join us to lead this ambitious programme of work and look forward to working with him over the next six months.

Andy Haldane said:

Levelling up the UK is one of the signature challenges of our time. It has also been a personal passion throughout my professional career. So, I am delighted and honoured to be making a contribution to this crucial objective by heading the new Levelling Up Taskforce.  I look forward to working with colleagues across government, local and national, and with the private and voluntary sectors, to design and deliver an economy that works for every part of the UK.

Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Permanent Secretary Jeremy Pocklington said:

This department is leading the way in championing levelling up, and our recently unveiled second headquarters in the city of Wolverhampton reflects our commitment to driving growth across the UK. I’m incredibly excited that we are at the forefront of such important work.

Tim Eyles, Chair of the RSA, said:

The RSA has a long history of working with government to help resolve the challenges of our time.

TheUKHSA– previously the National Institute for Health Protection – will be the UK leader for health security, providing intellectual, scientific and operational leadership at national and local level, as well as on the global stage. It will ensure the nation can respond quickly and at greater scale to deal with pandemics and future threats.

The primary focus for theUKHSAin its initial phase of operation will be the continued fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

It will bring together the country’s cutting-edge capabilities in data analytics and genomic surveillance with scale testing and contact tracing capability – combining key elements of Public Health England with the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC), and NHS Test and Trace.

Formally established in April 2021, theUKHSAwill be chaired by Ian Peters, currently Chair of Barts Health NHS Trust and former Chief Executive of British Gas, Managing Director of NatWest Small Business Services, and chairman of several data-driven growth technology companies.

Dr Harries has previously served on the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and brings a wealth of public health knowledge and expertise gained from working in the NHS and local government at local, regional and national levels. She played central roles in the UK’s response to COVID, Ebola, Zika, monkeypox,MERSand the Novichok attacks.

Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said:

TheUKHSAwill be this country’s permanent standing capacity to plan, prevent and respond to external threats to health. It will bring together our capabilities from the scientific excellence embodied by the likes of Dr Susan Hopkins and her amazing colleagues in clinical public health, to the extraordinary capability of NHS Test and Trace which Dido Harding has built so effectively over the last 9 months and theJBC.

Dr Jenny Harries brings huge local, regional and national experience to the role and is perfectly placed to help us not only learn lessons from the COVID-19 response, but to keep us in a state of readiness, primed to respond to infectious diseases and other external health threats.

I want everybody atUKHSA, at all levels, to wake up every day with a zeal to plan for the next pandemic.  The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the world-leading capabilities of the country’s public health science, and it has also shown the challenges of protecting the nation’s health are changing at an unprecedented pace, as new types of threats emerge.

Dr Jenny Harries, incoming Chief Executive,UKHSAsaid:

The pandemic has put the UK’s health security capabilities in sharp focus and theUKHSAwill change the way we approach health protection.

With the creation of theUKHSA, we have an unprecedented opportunity to build on the scientific and operational strength that has been developed, learn from the past and further develop strong bonds with health protection leadership from global to local, to ensure we are ready for the challenges of the future.

TheUKHSAwill be agile in its responses, maximise the benefits of high-quality data, be relentless in its mission to rapidly identify and respond to new threats, whilst working seamlessly with academia, scientists, industry and local communities.

In starting this important work I want to pay tribute to the commitment and professionalism of all those colleagues who have worked so hard in NHS Test and Trace, inPHEand in theJBC. I look forward to building a diverse, dynamic and dedicated world-leading health security agency with them.

Ian Peters, incoming Chair,UKHSAsaid:

I’m delighted to be joiningUKHSA. We are at a watershed moment in history, dealing with a global pandemic and soon we’ll be moving our focus to preventing such health emergencies in future, while playing a key role in reducing health inequalities. TheUKHSAwill be at the heart of protecting the British people from health threats for decades to come.

I do not underestimate the importance of this role and will lean on my recent years within the NHS, my experience in transforming major companies, and my insights in data-driven technology to ensure theUKHSAfulfils its vital purpose.

Dr Harries will leave her role as Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England in April to becomeUKHSAChief Executive. She will take over from current Executive Chair of NHS Test and Trace Baroness Dido Harding after a handover period through April, whilePHE’s Interim Chief Executive, Michael Brodie, will remain in post to lead delivery ofPHE’s health improvement and healthcare public health functions and support the transition.

Executive Chair of NHS Test and Trace, Baroness Harding said:

It has been a privilege to serve in the national response against COVID and to establish the scale testing, tracing and analytical capability that makes up NHS Test and Trace and the Joint Biosecurity Centre. I have been inspired by the hard work and dedication every single person has put in since the start of 2020 to constantly improve our fight against the pandemic.

The combination of Public Health England and NHS Test and Trace skills and experience create a strong foundation for theUKHSAto build on so we can continue to respond to the challenges of this pandemic, whilst creating a future in which we stand fully equipped to protect against emerging health threats.

Interim Chief Executive of Public Health England, Michael Brodie said:

I’m extremely proud of the commitment and skill shown byPHEstaff in all of their work to protect and improve the nation’s health, most recently responding to the pandemic alongside our partners at NHS Test and Trace. Dr Harries now has an exciting opportunity to take our excellent health protection science and expertise in responding to health threats to the next level, through the establishment of theUKHSA.

I look forward to working closely with the organisation over the coming months as we establish a new public health system which builds on our outstanding capabilities across health improvement and health protection and our vital relationships with local government and the NHS.

The Agency will lead on health protection and security activity for England, and will also take over from thePHEand NHS Test and Trace work those organisations already carry out on a UK basis, either as reserved functions or under collaborative arrangements with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland administrations (for example, the Joint Biosecurity Centre). It will not replace the public health agencies in the other 3 UK countries, but will operate a close collaborative relationship with them.

TheUKHSABoard will be announced in due course. The Board will have a key role to play in providing constructive challenge, advice and support to the Chief Executive and the executive team.

The government department iswriting out to all UK based VAT-registered traders, as well as continuing to send weekly email updates to more than 170,000 customers.

Katherine Green and Sophie Dean, Directors General, Borders and Trade,HMRC, said:

We know how challenging it is for businesses to adapt to so many changes, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. And we appreciate how much traders have done already.

Customs and tax rules are complex, and we understand customers working through them for the first time need more support. That’s why we launched the newSME Brexit Support Fundthat can pay up to £2,000 for training or professional advice about customs and VAT, for businesses that are new to the importing and exporting rules, and we’ve also announced a six-month delay to the introduction of full import border controls, giving our customers more time to prepare and get to grips with the changes.

We want our customers to know thatHMRCis here to help. Our Customs and International Trade helpline has been expanded and we’ve extended our operating hours, while continuing to runregular live webinarsthat traders can join.

HMRCalso recommend that traders:

decide if they want todelay import declarationsor duty payments on goods moving between EU into Great Britain

appoint a specialist to deal with importand export declarations. This is important, regardless of the amount or value of trade your business does with Europe. Most companies use a third party such as a freight forwarder or fast parcel operator to deal with this and do not make their customs declarations themselves

find out whether they can claim thepreferential rates of dutythat were agreed in December’s cooperation and trade agreement between the UK and the EU

check what support is available formoving goods through Northern Ireland

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/environment-secretary-to-set-out-plans-to-restore-nature-and-build-back-greener-from-the-pandemic,Press release,Environment Secretary to set out plans to restore nature and build back greener from the pandemic,"Environment Secretary makes landmark speech, outlining plans to protect and restore nature, tackle the climate and biodiversity crises and help deliver Net Zero by 2050.","Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, Forestry Commission and Natural England",18 May 2021,"Plans to boost biodiversity, protect our peatlands and create new woodlands will be set out today by the Environment Secretary, George Eustice, in a speech outlining the government’s ambitions to restore nature and safeguard our environment for future generations.

Speaking from Delamere Forest, he will announce new measures to tackle climate change and the biodiversity crisis and deliver our net zero commitment, including steps to take forward recommendations from the Dasgupta Review on the Economics of Biodiversity.

He will also announce amendments to the Environment Bill, including a historic new legally-binding species target for 2030 which will drive action to halt the decline of nature and wildlife.

We will be amending the Environment Bill to require an additional legally binding target for species for 2030, aiming to halt the decline of nature.

This is a huge step forward, and a world leading measure in the year of COP15 and COP26 as we build back greener from the pandemic. We hope that this will be the Net Zero equivalent for nature, spurring action of the scale required to address the biodiversity crisis.

Further details of the Government’s new peat action plan will be announced, setting out a framework to improve the management, protection and restoration of both our upland and lowland peatlands. As England’s largest carbon store on land, peatlands play a vital role in trapping carbon, helping to control flooding and encouraging plants and vegetation that act as homes for wildlife, but when damaged, for example when mined for compost, they can end up emitting their carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

A new Nature for Climate Peatland Grant Scheme will support the restoration of 35,000 hectares of degraded peatland in England, backed by over £50 million between 2021 and 2025.

The Environment Secretary will also confirm that the Government will ban sales of peat products by the end of this Parliament, subject to public consultation this year.

Plans to treble tree planting rates in England during this Parliament will be funded through £500 million from the Nature for Climate Fund while a major new multi-million pound tree planting grant – the England Woodland Creation Offer - will provide greater financial incentives for landowners and farmers to plant and manage trees.

Today, I am also outlining measures to better protect our existing trees and woodland and set us on the path to ensure that we have at least 12% of woodland cover by the middle of the century.

It is our ambition that all woodlands in England will improve the environment, acknowledging that our woods and trees are vital habitats. The iconic oak tree alone supports 2,300 species, of which 326 are dependent on oak trees for their survival.  Trees are also important for sequestering carbon. Indeed woodlands currently sequester about 4% of the UK’s gross emissions.

At least three new community forests will be created though a new programme, Trees for Climate, to allow more people to be closer to nature and enable the planting of 6,000 hectares of new woodland by 2025, building on the 500 hectares planted in the last year.

To tackle the loss of native species in this country a new Species Reintroduction Taskforce will take forward work around the reintroduction of species which have been lost to England – such as wildcat – and the introduction of declining species into new areas to help populations recover. This could include the reintroduction of beavers in some parts of England. The Government will publish a consultation this summer on its approach to this and the management of beavers in the wild.

The Taskforce will bring together experts, landowners and NGOs to share knowledge, assess and prioritise species for reintroduction and to develop partnerships for delivering high-quality projects.

Also making speeches today are Tony Juniper, Chair of Natural England and Sir William Worsley, Chair of the Forestry Commission.

A new target for Nature recovery enshrined in law will be a powerful new driver for coordinated action, as was found on cutting greenhouse gas emissions following the passage of the Climate Change Act. Meeting a stretching Nature target can be done, so long as we can join up different policy areas, such as farming, housing development and infrastructure, while also improving overall environmental quality in terms of air and water pollution.

Natural England stands ready to work across Government to help make it happen, including through the delivery of an ambitious Nature Recovery Network that will see not only the improvement of our vital protected areas and the restoration of lost habitats, including woodland, wetland and heaths, but also the return of lost species.

The climate emergency means we need new trees, woodland and forests more than ever before. They are vital for absorbing carbon dioxide, but also for providing homes for wildlife, helping reduce flood risk, to offering huge benefits for our health and wellbeing. The plans announced today are hugely exciting and map out how trees will be part of the solution to getting to Net Zero.

Today’s announcements are part of the Government’s commitments to drive international ambition on action to tackle climate change and work towards nature-based solutions ahead of the G7 Climate and Environment Ministers’ meeting taking place this week, the upcoming 15th UN Biodiversity Conference of the Parties (Convention of Biological Diversity COP15), and the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) which will be hosted in Glasgow later this year.

In the run-up to the summit, the UK is focused on four goals to drive progress: securing global net zero, protecting communities and natural habitats from the impacts of climate change, mobilising finance and working together to accelerate action.

The Secretary of State and the Chairs of Natural England and Forestry Commission will speak from Delamere Forest from 1:30pm (Tuesday 18 May) at an online event hosted by The Wildlife Trusts. The event will be live streamed from 13:30pm and hosted onThe Wildlife Trusts’ YouTube channel.

Today we face a twin nature and climate emergency – these crises are entirely interlinked and one cannot be tackled without addressing the other. It’s essential that we stop nature’s decline and restore 30% of land and sea by 2030 – doing so will help wildlife fight back and enable repaired habitats to store carbon once more. Vast, landscape-scale restoration projects need funding by government to help us reach this target because, at the moment, only 10% of our land is protected for nature and only half of this is in a good state. Nature Recovery Networks need to be at the heart of our future planning system so that our new nature places are carefully mapped out, joined up and put where they will work best for nature and people.

Today’s announcement follows the recently launched Queen’s Green Canopy – a unique, UK-wide tree planting initiative created to mark Her Majesty’s Platinum Jubilee in 2022, by inviting people to “Plant a Tree for the Jubilee”.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-outlines-plans-to-help-cut-energy-bills-for-businesses,Press release,Government outlines plans to help cut energy bills for businesses,"Support for households, businesses and public sector organisations facing rising energy bills has been unveiled.","Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, HM Treasury, Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street, The Rt Hon Elizabeth Truss, The Rt Hon Jacob Rees-Mogg and The Rt Hon Kwasi Kwarteng",21 September 2022,"New support for households, businesses and public sector organisations facing rising energy bills in Great Britain and Northern Ireland has been unveiled by Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg today (Wednesday 21 September) – supporting growth, preventing unnecessary insolvencies and protecting jobs.

Through a new governmentEnergy Bill Relief Scheme, the government will provide a discount on wholesale gas and electricity prices for all non-domestic customers (including all UK businesses, the voluntary sector like charities and the public sector such as schools and hospitals) whose current gas and electricity prices have been significantly inflated in light of global energy prices. This support will be equivalent to theEnergy Price Guaranteeput in place for households.

It will apply to fixed contracts agreed on or after 1 April 2022, as well as to deemed, variable and flexible tariffs and contracts. It will apply to energy usage from 1 October 2022 to 31 March 2023, running for an initial 6 month period for all non-domestic energy users. The savings will be first seen in October bills, which are typically received in November.

As with the Energy Price Guarantee for households, customers do not need to take action or apply to the scheme to access the support. Support (in the form of a p/kWh discount) will automatically be applied to bills.

To administer support, the government has set a Supported Wholesale Price – expected to be £211 perMWhfor electricity and £75 perMWhfor gas, less than half the wholesale prices anticipated this winter – which is a discounted price per unit of gas and electricity. This is equivalent to the wholesale element of the Energy Price Guarantee for households. It includes the removal of green levies paid by non-domestic customers who receive support under the scheme.

The level of price reduction for each business will vary depending on their contract type and circumstances:

A parallel scheme, based on the same criteria and offering comparable support, but recognising the different market fundamentals, will be established in Northern Ireland.

If you are not connected to either the gas or electricity grid, equivalent support will also be provided for non-domestic consumers who use heating oil or alternative fuels instead of gas. Further detail on this will be announced shortly.

We will publish a review into the operation of the scheme in three months to inform decisions on future support after March 2023. The review will focus in particular on identifying the most vulnerable non-domestic customers and how the government will continue assisting them with energy costs.

Prime Minister Liz Truss said:

I understand the huge pressure businesses, charities and public sector organisations are facing with their energy bills, which is why we are taking immediate action to support them over the winter and protect jobs and livelihoods.

As we are doing for consumers, our new scheme will keep their energy bills down from October, providing certainty and peace of mind.

At the same time, we are boosting Britain’s homegrown energy supply so we fix the root cause of the issues we are facing and ensure greater energy security for us all.

Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng said:

We have stepped in to stop businesses collapsing, protect jobs, and limit inflation.

And with our plans to boost home-grown energy supply, we will bring security to the sector, growth to the economy and secure a better deal for consumers.

Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg said:

We have seen an unprecedented rise in energy prices following Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine, which has affected consumers up and down the country and businesses of all sizes.

The help we are already putting in place will save families money off their bills, and the government’s plans for businesses, charities and public sector organisations will give them the equivalent level of support.

This, alongside the measures we are taking to boost the amount of domestic energy we produce to improve both energy security and supply, will increase growth, protect jobs and support families with their cost of living this winter.

Kate Nicholls, CEO of UKHospitality said:

This intervention is unprecedented and it is extremely welcome that government has listened to hospitality businesses facing an uncertain winter. We particularly welcome its inclusiveness – from the smallest companies to the largest - all of which combine to provide a huge number of jobs, which are now much more secure.

The government has recognised the vulnerability of hospitality as a sector, and we will continue to work with the government, to ensure that there is no cliff edge when these measures fall away.

Today’s announcement follows the launch of the Energy Price Guarantee for households in Great Britain, under which a typical household will pay on average £2,500 a year on their energy bill for the next two years from 1 October.

The scheme limits the price suppliers can charge customers for units of gas and electricity, taking account of the Exchequer temporarily funding for two years environmental and social costs, including green levies – worth around £150 – which are currently included in domestic energy bills. The guarantee supersedes the existing price cap and is expected to save the average household £1,000 a year based on current energy prices from October.

It also comes in addition to the announced £400 energy bills discount for all households and together, they will bring costs close to where the energy price cap currently stands.

Today, the Business Secretary also confirmed equivalent support for households in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Energy Price Guarantee will offer households the same level of gas and electricity bill support as the equivalent scheme in Great Britain.

Households in Northern Ireland will also receive a £400 discount on bills through the Northern Ireland Energy Bills Support Scheme (NIEBSS), the same support as is available in Great Britain.

For the Energy Price Guarantee, the scheme will still work through electricity and gas bills. The scheme will provide households in Northern Ireland with equivalent financial support with their electricity and gas bills as for those in Great Britain. Energy suppliers will reduce bills by a unit price reduction of up to 17p/kWh for electricity and 4.2p/kWh for gas, and there is no need to take any action to receive this support. This will take effect from November, but the government will ensure households receive support so they will see the same benefit overall as those households in Great Britain backdating support for October bills through bills from November.

The government also announced today further details on the separateEnergy Bills Support Scheme (EBSS)to ensure that the £400 discount to households starting from October will also be available to the 1% of households who would not otherwise have received this support.

Additional funding will be made available so that £400 payments will be extended to include people such as park home residents and those tenants whose landlords pay for their energy via a commercial contract. The government is committed to ensuring such households receive the same support for their energy bills.  The government will introduce legislation to make sure landlords pass theEBSSdiscount on to tenants who pay all-inclusive bills.

The government will also provide an additional payment of £100 to households across the UK who are not able to receive support for their heating costs through the Energy Price Guarantee. This might be because they live in an area of the UK that is not served by the gas grid and is to compensate for the rising costs of alternative fuels such as heating oil.

A pub uses 4MWhof electricity and 16MWhof gas a month. They signed a fixed contract in August 2022, giving them a current monthly energy bill of about £7,000. At the time they signed their contact, wholesale prices for the next 6 months were expected to be higher than the Government Supported Price of £211/MWhfor electricity, and £75/MWhfor gas, meaning they can receive support under this scheme.

The difference between expected wholesale prices when they signed their contract and the Government Supported Price is worth £380/MWhfor electricity and £100/MWhfor gas, meaning they receive a discount of £3,100 per month, reducing their bill by over 40%.

A school uses 10MWhof electricity and 22MWhof gas a month. They signed a fixed contract in July 2022, giving them a current monthly energy bill of about £10,000. At the time they signed their contact, wholesale prices for the next 6 months were expected to be higher than the Government Supported Price of £211/MWhfor electricity, and £75/MWhfor gas, meaning they can receive support under this scheme.

The difference between expected wholesale prices when they signed their contract and the Government Supported Price is worth £240/MWhfor electricity and £70/MWhfor gas, meaning they receive a discount of £4,000 per month, reducing their original bill by 40%.

The government will conduct a review of the government Energy Bill Relief Scheme, to be published in 3 months’ time, to assess:

Martin McTague, National Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said:

Small businesses called for decisive action – now the government is delivering. With small firms the least able to avoid closure and 16 million employees relying on them, Ministers have listened to our community and got this big call right. Now it’s up to energy retailers to live up to the high bar set today and make sure this help reaches those on the ground.

Jonathan Geldart, Director General of the Institute of Directors, said:

This is an important intervention by the government and provides much needed short-term reassurance for the numerous firms that are facing soaring energy bills. We look forward to working with the government in the coming months to ensure that further relief is targeted at those industries and sectors whose survival is most threatened by current economic conditions.

Ultimately, however, business and government will need to work hand in hand to develop domestic energy sources and reduce consumption and dependency on expensive fossil fuels.

Anthony Impey, CEO of Be the Business, said:

This package of support will give business owners the confidence to take long term investment decisions, which many have been postponing in response to rising prices.

They can now focus their efforts on activities that drive growth and productivity, such as adoption of technology and increasing the skills of their employees and management teams.

James Lowman, Chief Executive, Association of Convenience Stores, said:

We strongly welcome the government’s support package which will provide a lifeline for thousands of local shops, enabling them to keep trading and serving their communities.

We will continue to work closely with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy on longer term solutions to the energy crisis facing convenience stores and other businesses, including ways to incentivise investment in energy efficient technology.

The Food and Drink Federation CEO Karen Betts said:

We welcome the scope of the government’s Energy Bill Relief Scheme and the speed with which it’s being rolled out.  It addresses the largest and most volatile cost pressure facing our industry right now. Although some aspects of the scheme are still to be clarified, it offers relief to food and drink manufacturers across the UK.

Stephen Phipson CEO of Make UK, the manufacturers’ organisation said:

Industry will warmly welcome the timely announcement of an energy price cap for an initial 6 months for all business users. Government has delivered a scheme which is simple to understand, giving reassurance to the business sector. However as appear prices will likely remain high for many months to come, industry will need support for a longer period to protect jobs and remain competitive, so the further announcement of a review on future support at the 3 month stage is reassuring.

We hope that this support can be made tangible as quickly as possible and not applied retrospectively at the end of the next quarter."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/329-million-to-create-a-national-network-of-walking-and-cycling-experts,News story,£32.9 million to create a national network of walking and cycling experts,Funding will help councils to develop better designed walking and cycling schemes.,"Department for Transport, Active Travel England and The Rt Hon Jesse Norman MP",2 January 2023,"Millions of families, commuters and school children are being encouraged to take up healthy habits this year. Local councils will benefit from skills training and a boost to green jobs thanks to a £32.9 million scheme launched today (2 January 2023) which will enable them to develop thousands of well thought-through local walking and cycling schemes, co-created by the communities that will use them.

As people across the country are looking to kickstart the year with healthy resolutions, the government expects to see millions shake up the way they travel.

The investment will help local councils in England design, develop and consult on high-quality active travel schemes that work for residents and consider the local road network. These could include new school safety zones to encourage active travel, improved walking and cycling infrastructure on local high streets as well as new cycle and wheelchair paths.

The measures aim to get more people of all groups walking and cycling and help to address the barriers that exist. Surveys show the number one issue putting women off cycling is how safe they feel on the roads with 79% of women supporting more protected cycle lanes being built. Safety will therefore be the major focus for the new designs and routes.

This funding will support local authorities to maximise active travel investment by enhancing their technical skills. Local councils will be investing in resources dedicated to co-creating schemes communities want. Activities being funded include network planning, public engagement exercises and bespoke training for councillors and staff. The fund could see hundreds of new green jobs created across England.

Making active travel part of everyday journeys can improve health, cut costs and protect the environment. Cycling UK has estimated that if people cycled short journeys, they would save an average of £126 per year in fuel costs alone and would burn hundreds of extra calories each week.

Active Travel Minister Jesse Norman said:

Leaving the car and walking and cycling instead is an easy way to get fit, save money and reduce your carbon footprint.

Better designed schemes, which take into account the views of local people will help deliver improvements that have widespread local support.

Skills training and local community engagement will help local authorities to make active travel an attractive choice for getting around.

Developing teams that lead active travel programmes will create more cost-effective and well-targeted projects. Local authorities will learn how to enhance their engagement with residents, businesses and other road users to ensure schemes are delivered with local support.

National Active Travel Commissioner, Chris Boardman, said:

If we want to enable hundreds of thousands more people to walk, wheel and cycle for everyday trips then we need to deliver high-quality schemes that make it feel easy, fun and safe.

Of course, ensuring the right technical skills are in place at a local level is vital but so is engagement. Survey after survey has shown strong community support for making space for active travel but it’s vital that people get strong input into helping to decide what is the right solution for their area.

The funding will also be used to engage under-represented groups and enable more children to walk, wheel and cycle to school. Community engagement programmes will give individuals the confidence to walk and cycle safely through cycle training, school walking groups and bike rental schemes.

Xavier Brice, Chief Executive Officer of Sustrans, the charity that makes it easier for people to walk, wheel and cycle, said:

Sustrans is pleased to see this investment in training and community engagement which will ultimately lead to high-quality infrastructure developments across England that help people choose to use their cars less.

This funding is crucial in ensuring that travelling actively is a safe and accessible option for all, particularly as we work towards the government’s goal of 50% of all journeys in towns and cities being walked or cycled by 2030.

We’re looking forward to seeing ambitious plans being brought to life and continuing our work to support our local authorities in doing so.

People will benefit from better access to jobs and education through initiatives such as outreach to schools and employment centres.

The ‘capability fund’ will support local councils across the country to train and retain local engineers and planners, creating a skilled active travel workforce able to collaborate effectively with local communities and conduct high-quality engagement and consultation sessions.

As well as enabling local councils to hire and retain skilled professionals, this multi-million-pound investment will deliver specialised training, driving up skills and ensuring consistent, high-quality schemes are set up across England to give people truly attractive active travel choices.

businesses struggling will have now until the end of March to access government generous loan schemes

Chancellor also confirmed that the Budget will be on the 3 March and set out the next phase of the plan to tackle the virus and protect jobs

In a move to ensure firms can access the support they need through continuing economic disruption, Rishi Sunak also confirmed he would be extending the government-guaranteed Covid-19 business loan schemes until the end of March.

These changes come ahead of the Budget, which the Chancellor has confirmed will take place on 3 March 2021. This will deliver the next phase of the plan to tackle the virus and protect jobs, so the extensions to the business loan and furlough schemes enable businesses to plan with certainty and access support in the first few months of the New Year ahead of the further update on wider Covid-19 economic support.

So far, the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) scheme has protected 9.6 million jobs across the UK with more than one million businesses accessing loans to help them through the crisis.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said:

“Our package of support for businesses and workers continues to be one of the most generous and effective in the world – helping our economy to recover and protecting livelihoods across the country.

“We know the premium businesses place on certainty, so it is right that we enable businesses to plan ahead regardless of the path the virus takes, which is why we’re providing certainty and clarity by extending this support, as well as implementing our Plan for Jobs.”

Business Secretary, Alok Sharma, said:

“While our loan schemes have provided a vital lifeline to millions of firms across the country, we know that business owners need additional certainty as we head into the New Year.

“Extending government-backed loan schemes will give companies right across the UK the finance they need to support, protect and create jobs as we build back better from the pandemic.”

The Chancellor said he would review the employer contribution element of the CJRS in January, but decided to bring this forward to allow businesses to plan ahead for the remainder of the winter and the New Year.

The government will continue to pay 80% of the salary of employees for hours not worked until the end of April. Employers will only be required to pay wages, National Insurance Contributions (NICS) and pensions for hours worked; and NICS and pensions for hours not worked.

The eligibility criteria for the UK-wide scheme will remain unchanged and these changes will continue to apply to all Devolved Administrations.

Extending the scheme until the end of April means businesses across the country will have certainty about what support will be available to them.

Businesses will also be given until the end of March to access the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, and the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme. These had been due to close at the end of January.

The schemes have already provided over £68 billion in guaranteed loans, and helped to keep afloat business in all sectors of the UK economy who have been impacted by coronavirus.

We are extending the schemes now, ahead of Christmas and further into the new year, to ensure that businesses can continue to access the support they need to grow and recover.

The government has already announced that more support will be available beyond March, through a successor loan scheme. More details of the scheme will be announced in due course, with the government providing a further update on wider Covid-19 economic support at the Budget on 3 March.

The furlough and loan schemes are part of the government’s wider plan to support, create and protect jobs through its Plan for Jobs. This includes the Kickstart Scheme, more investment in training and skills as well as the Self Employment Income Support Scheme grant, with a fourth grant being made available from February to April 2021.

Its value of the creative industries to the UK is up from £94.8 billion in 2016 to £101.5 billion, and has grown at nearly twice the rate of the economy since 2010, according tofigurespublished today by the Department for Digital, Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS).

Film, TV, radio, photography, music, advertising, museums, galleries and digital creative industries are all part of this thriving sector.

The increase has been driven in part by a boom in the computer services sub-sector which includes video games such as Batman Arkham made by London-based games company, Rocksteady Studios and Red Dead Redemption 2 produced by Scottish company, Rockstar Games. This sector alone is worth £5.11 billion.

Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Jeremy Wright said:

Our creative industries not only fly the flag for the best of British creativity at home and abroad but they are also at the heart of our economy.

Today they have broken the £100 billion mark and continue on a hugely positive upward trajectory, outperforming the wider UK economy and bringing joy and entertainment to millions.

We’re doing all we can to support the sector’s talent and entrepreneurship as we build a Britain that is fit for future.

The strength of the creative industries is matched by the UK’s world leading digital and tech sector, which has seen its contribution to the UK economy increase by 7.3 per cent between 2016 and 2017 and by 32.9 per cent since 2010. It is now worth more than £130 billion.

It continues to perform highly and over the last two months British tech firms Monzo, Farfetch and Funding Circle have surpassed the$1 billion mark, meaning they are now so-called ‘unicorns’.

The Government continues to back the creative industries. Dedicated tax reliefs supporting high-end television and film productions such as Peaky Blinders and Darkest Hour have seen a boom worth £12.6 billion since the schemes were introduced. There was also £1.38 billion of inward investment in the film industry last year as a result of tax relief.

As part of the Government’s Industrial Strategy,nine new Creative Clustersacross the UK have benefitted from £80 million funding to boost innovation by part-funding research partnerships between universities and industry. They aim to increase the use of digital technologies to improve audience experience in the screen and performance industries, and shorten production times in the design industry.

This dovetails with investment in the UK’s digital sector. This month’s Budget included nearly £300 million of investment in emerging technologies including AI and quantum, with up to £50 million to be invested innew Turing AI Fellowshipsto help bring the best global researchers in AI to the UK, and£235 millionto establish a new National Quantum Computing Centre, a quantum challenge to bring the technology to market and new centres for doctoral training.

Britain’s thriving tourism sector makes up almost four per cent of the UK economy - worth £67.7 billion in 2017.

The value of sport to the UK economy has increased by 5.3 per cent year-on-year and by 40 per cent since 2010. Sport’s value, which includes sport equipment production and the operation of sports facilities, rose to £9.8 billion, although this does not include the sports broadcasting rights or sports advertising markets.

DCMS sectors’ contribution to the UK economy overall continues to rise, with GVA at £267.7 billion in 2017, up 3.4 per cent year-on-year. DCMS sectors now account for 14.6 per cent of the UK’s GVA.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/disasters-rapid-response-network-ready-if-crises-hit,News story,Disasters: Rapid response network ready if crises hit,Britain is setting up a network of top businesses and charities to respond when large scale emergencies hit,Department for International Development and The Rt Hon Andrew Mitchell MP,7 March 2012,"Britain is to establish a new rapid response network of top UK-based businesses and charities to provide emergency relief when major international crises hit - such as floods, famines and earthquakes.

The network, called the Rapid Response Facility, will mobilise life-saving support in the critical hours following a humanitarian disaster, Andrew Mitchell said today.

It is the first time a British government has brought together the power of the private sector as well as non-governmental organisations in this way to take part in emergency relief.

Following a disaster, supplies, experts and vital aid are too often tied up with paperwork, rather than being immediately deployed.

The new facility allows organisations with extensive experience in disaster response to access funding within hours, thereby reaching affected people faster and saving more lives. It will mean the best organisations from across the UK can be mobilised in the critical first 72 hours following a disaster.

So far, 34 organisations have been approved. They include large organisations like Christian Aid, Guava International (Land Rover), Mercy Corps and Oxfam.

Specialist organisations are also included, such as the medical relief experts Merlin, water purifiers Lifesaver Systems and mapping volunteers MapAction.

The facility will see greater collaboration than ever before between government, charities and business, to ensure the British response is effectively coordinated.

A real-time disaster planning exercise at the Department for International Development has tested how the new facility would get help to affected people quickly and effectively.

The new Rapid Response Facility will be activated in the event of a large scale humanitarian crisis. The selected organisations will be approached within hours and expected to take immediate action to deliver targeted aid to affected people.

International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell said:

We need our best experts, equipment and aid on the ground quickly after a disaster, not tied up in red tape. They need to be able to do their job in the vital window of 72 hours, to save as many lives as possible.

These organisations represent the very best performing disaster response agencies. They will deliver value for money for British taxpayers, and results that best benefit affected people. This allows them to focus on delivery, not paperwork.

The private sector plays a vital role in emergency response and I am particularly encouraged that so many have already agreed to be involved in the Rapid Response Facility.

To ensure the continuing high performance of the facility, pre-qualification can be revoked at the first sign of poor performance.

The Rapid Response Facility delivers on the Government’s commitment to have a pre-qualification process focused on delivery, not bureaucracy, in response to Lord Ashdown’s review of how Britain responds to humanitarian emergencies.

Conferencein London’s tech city, co-hosted withOmidyar Network.

Speaking at the conference she set out how Britain will help 6 million of the world’s poorest people to benefit from innovative projects across Africa and Asia.

Video: Justine Greening’s speech to the Open Up! conference



She is also committing to use mobile and internet technology to make governments more effective and transparent and help the poorest to have a say in the future of aid.

There are now over 5 billion mobile connections in the developing world, increasing by 18 per second. At the same time, the United Nations estimates that 80 million people have no access to an electrical grid but do use a mobile phone.

International Development Secretary Justine Greening said:

“With more than a thousand new mobile connections every minute in the developing world, we have a tremendous opportunity to ensure the voices of the poorest are heard. Mobile and web technology has the power to transform lives and improve the way governments work, but too often it has been overlooked.

“I am determined to use Britain’s aid to help citizens have a say in their future, speak up when they face crime or incompetence and make it easier to trade and grow businesses.”

Britain will promote mobile and internet technology by:

Helping the poorest to decide their future: Working with the United Nations, mobile technology companyKirusaand others, DFID will support MyWorld - a mobile survey to allow at least two million in the poorest countries to have a direct say in the future of international aid through their mobile phones.

Making aid more transparent: Britain will launch a new Open Aid Information Platform to allow anyone to trace spending from Whitehall down to specific aid projects on the ground across the developing world.

Helping poor countries to harness the power of the internet: Working with Sir Tim Berners-Lee’sWorld Wide Web Foundation, Britain will help to close the ‘digital divide’ by researching internet use in poor countries and provide a solid evidence base to find new ways to use the power of the web to improve the lives of the poorest.

Kick-starting innovative new tech ideas: Britain will launch a new partnership to help six million people in the poorest countries to benefit from new technology.Making All Voices Countis collaboration between DFID,Omidyar Network,USAIDand theSwedish Governmentto spot innovative ideas and make them work. All software devised through this programme will be open source, allowing others to use and adapt it as necessary.

Fight corruption and improve services: Britain will help the people of Pakistan to report poor performing or corrupt local officials direct to senior Ministers through their mobile phones. Every citizen who contacts the Punjab province’s local government, tax office, police, health or education services will receive free automated calls or text messages where they can report if they were forced to pay a bribe or experienced bad customer service. During a three-year pilot, several corrupt officials were suspended or sacked.

The UK and Indonesia are currently co-chairs of theOpen Government Partnership, a global effort to make governments more transparent, effective and accountable. Through the partnership, the UK encourages governments across the world join and demonstrate their commitment to open government and transparency, with institutions that empower citizens and are responsive to their aspirations.

Omidyar Network Partner Stephen King said:

“Responsive and accountable government requires openness and an engaged citizenry. Open Up! will showcase the technology tools that foster transparency and also share the experiences of leading social entrepreneurs who are doing the hard, day-to-day work to bring governments and citizens closer together.

“The conversations that begin today are meant to encourage greater collaboration, inspire new innovations, and accelerate the pace of the open government movement. At stake are greater accountability of government to its citizens, improved service delivery, and economic growth and prosperity.”

Inventor of the World Wide Web Sir Tim Berners-Lee said:

“I am delighted that the UK government is supporting The Web Index, so that policymakers and others can come to fully understand the political, economic and social impact of the web’s growth and utility on poor people and nations.

“I commend the leadership and commitment of the UK in the open data effort. Opening up data is fundamentally about more efficient use of resources and improving service delivery for citizens.”"
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/lord-ashdown-to-lead-review-of-emergency-aid,News story,Lord Ashdown to lead review of emergency aid,The way the UK responds to humanitarian emergencies such as the Haiti earthquake will be the subject of a comprehensive review,Department for International Development and The Rt Hon Andrew Mitchell MP,14 July 2010,"The way the UK responds to humanitarian emergencies such as the Haiti earthquake will be the subject of a comprehensive review, Secretary of State for International Development Andrew Mitchell will announce today.

Lord Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon will lead a taskforce of humanitarian experts from inside and outside government to review all aspects of how the UK Government responds to disasters and works with the international community to speed up the delivery of aid.

The review is launched six months after the devastating earthquake in Haiti which claimed more than 230,000 lives. It will look into how the UK - already considered one of the best countries at humanitarian deployments - can build on its strengths in responding impartially to humanitarian needs and help ensure future disaster responses can be better prepared and coordinated.

The review will also look at how the UK can best work with international bodies and UN agencies in emergency situations to ensure that the global response to disasters improves.

At the same time, natural disasters are getting more frequent. The numbers of people affected by disasters are predicted to rise from some 250 million a year at the moment to 375 million by 2015.

Announcing the appointment, International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell said:

This new taskforce will look at the UK’s system to ensure we are at the forefront of disaster response efforts. I want us to be the model for other countries. The taskforce will be pushing for much-needed improvements in how international operations are managed.

The UK public have repeatedly shown enormous generosity to those in need.  It is vital that the entire international system is ready to meet the challenges of future disasters.

Lord Ashdown said:

The emergency response taskforce will ask searching questions of the UK and international response to ensure we are fully prepared and equipped, as well as providing value for money.

As the number of natural disasters is set to increase dramatically, the emergency response taskforce will make sure the Government is well prepared for future catastrophes.

The emergency response review will focus on:

Ensuring value for money and impact:With the number and complexity of disasters expected to double over the next ten years, it will help ensure value for money and effective impact on the ground.

Skills and expertise:The taskforce will look at how DFID can ensure our own humanitarian experts can use their skills to strengthen the leadership of the international system, such as how DFID seconds staff to UN posts and what training we provide.

An international review of humanitarian professionals around the world (in 2005) identified a potential lack of experts in critical sectors such as protection, shelter and early disaster recovery.

Coordination with UN, humanitarian organisations and the private sectorto ensure that the UK is helping to make international efforts more efficient, effective and well-coordinated. The National Audit Office report into the Asian Tsunami found that monitoring undertaken by DFID showed delays were occurring in implementing some international projects and this meant that unspent grants were being held back from people in need.

Delivery of aid:DFID has delivered 860 tonnes of non-food aid from its stocks in the UK and Dubai in the past 6 months. The review will test how well this system is set up and make sure the right material and equipment is in the right place at the right time.

Coordination with the rest of government:The Taskforce will investigate how DFID should coordinate with the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign and Commonwealth office to share resources where appropriate.

Technology:the review will look at how to maximise the use of new technologies such as mobile phone, satellite mapping and food innovations.

For example, in Haiti, Columbia University and the Karolinska Institute were able to analyse mobile phone data provided by the telephone company Digicel to map the migration patterns of displaced people following the earthquake in Haiti and discovered that 22% of the population had left Port-au-Prince by the end of January."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/somalia-aid-for-refugees-who-fled-famine-and-fighting,News story,Somalia: Aid for refugees who fled famine and fighting,"Britain will provide medical help, food and sanitation for hundreds of thousands of Somalis over the next three years.",Department for International Development and The Rt Hon Andrew Mitchell MP,23 February 2012,"The UK will provide a comprehensive package of assistance including healthcare, nutritional and sanitation assistance for those forced to flee the food crisis and fighting, finding refuge in neighbouring Kenya and Ethiopia.

In Kenya, UK aid will help 150,000 refugees per year over the next three years. In Ethiopia, Britain will reach 100,000 refugees every year up to 2015.

In addition to helping those who have fled the country, the UK has also committed to further emergency humanitarian assistance which will help over 1 million people within Somalia over the next year. This includes vital supplies and services such as food, clean water, healthcare and seeds and fertilisers.

The new package of support was announced at the start of theLondon Conference on Somaliataking place today. The summit is bringing together senior representatives from over 40 governments and global organisations. The gathering is intended to deliver a new international approach to Somalia.

At a meeting ahead of the conference this morning, Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell met with representatives from around the globe to focus on theongoing humanitarian needs of the Somali people.

During the session, delegates raised grave concerns that over 2 million people remain in crisis across the country. They also highlighted the growing number of Somali refugees in the region, which now totals almost 1 million.

Beyond immediate humanitarian needs, attendees called on the international community to help Somalis build up their ability to cope with disasters in the future. This long term support would focus on putting basic services in to place as well as providing the means for ordinary Somalis to make a living.

The latest aid announced by Britain today comes after the set up of a newStability Fund for Somalia- led by the UK - to help create jobs, agree local peace deals and set up basic services in areas where there is less fighting.

International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell said:

Over the last year I’ve met Somalis in camps in Mogadishu and border areas who have known nothing but war, hunger and extreme poverty.

Britain provided thousands of tonnes of food, water and medicine to help meet people’s basic needs and that help will continue.

But this conference gives us a chance to do much more by breaking the cycle of instability and agreeing a practical way forward that will improve things in the longer-term.

Over the last year,emergency British aid in Somalia helped to save 750,000 lives, following the famine which struck two separate regions of the country.

Across the country UK has provided relief assistance to more than a million victims of the drought including food and nutritional assistance to 300,000 people, vaccinations for over 1.3 million children for measles, and safe drinking water for more than 75,000 people."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dfid-help-to-the-hungry-people-of-sudan,News story,DFID help to the hungry people of Sudan,"DFID has responded to a World Food Programme (WFP) Sudan appeal with a contribution which will cover the costs of procurement and delivery of 30,000 metric tonnes of food.",Department for International Development,27 July 2010,"DFID has responded to a World Food Programme (WFP) Sudan appeal with a contribution which will cover the costs of procurement and delivery of 30,000 metric tonnes of food.  This will provide a month’s emergency food distributions to over 1.8 million people.

WFP appealed for almost $897 million in order to help approximately 6 million Sudanese people who don’t have enough food.

People are going hungry in Southern Sudan because of spiralling inter-tribal violence (390,000 were displaced in 2009), poor rains, and high food prices. Almost half of the population in Southern Sudan, 4.3 million people, has been assessed as likely not to have enough food in 2010.  1.6 million of those are likely to be close to starving.

In Darfur, some 2.7 million people in Internally Displaced Persons camps remain almost entirely dependant on WFP rations to meet their food needs.  Darfur continues to represent around 70% of the food aid requirements for Sudan.

The contribution of £20 million from DFID comes at the peak of the “hunger season” in Sudan, the pre-harvest period of heavy rains from May to September, when families are low on food stocks and the risk of malnutrition is highest."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dfid-research-research-to-action-launched-alongside-3ie-pim-workshop-in-cornwall,News story,DFID research: Research to Action launched alongside 3ie PIM workshop in Cornwall,Official launch of Research to Action; a website designed to provide relevant and up to date resources on research engagement and uptake.,Department for International Development,28 September 2012,"This week saw a meeting of international delegates involved in the Policy Influence Monitoring (PIM) project, funded by theInternational Initiative for Impact Evaluation(3ie), in Cornwall. To coincide with this, a workshop was held on the Tuesday followed by the official launch ofResearch to Action; a website designed to provide relevant and up to date resources on research engagement and uptake.

The 3ie PIM project is a three year global venture designed to monitor and evaluate the policy influence of independent evaluations being conducted across Africa, Latin America and South East Asia. The project is committed to supporting the grantees in order to maximise the value and impact of the Impact Evaluations.

On Tuesday the 25th of September delegates from the meeting, as well as individuals from organisations such as theOverseas Development Institute(ODI),CABI, theCentre for Poverty Analysis(CEPA) and theCentre for the Implementation of Public Policies promoting Equity and Growth(CIPPEC), and academics involved in research and policy in the UK met for a workshop held at the Academy for Innovation and Research at University College Falmouth in Cornwall.

Participants were asked to consider and discuss what constitutes policy influence and how it can be measured effectively. Through group discussions three clear considerations emerged as key in successful policy monitoring:

1.       Demand- seeing research in a political context; understanding existing demand and developing strategies for eliciting demand

2.       Attribution- establishing means of clearly attributing policy influence to particular research via testimonials, media pathways and altmetrics

3.       The Value of Policy Influence- considering whether policy change should always be the desired outcome of research

The afternoon workshop was followed by the official launch of the website Research to Action (R2A). R2A caters for the strategic and practical needs of people trying to improve the uptake of development research, in particular those funded by DFID. Populated with material useful to development researchers in designing tactical and effective communication strategies, R2A provides access to resources across the internet as well as hosting original content from contributing authors from organisations such as theInternational Network for the Availability of Scientific Publications(INASP), ODI andEuforic Services.

Andrew Clappison, communications manager at CommsConsult, thanked CABI, Euforic Services and CommsConsult,  for their help and continued support in setting up the website. R2A aims to be a platform where knowledge around research communication can be exchanged effectively. Clappison pointed out:

“Research to Action will not be a success without the support of the wider development community. We are all working towards similar goals and we need to unite around initiatives like this to ensure that they meet their potential. The Research to Action door is very much open to everyone.”

The website provides a space where discussions, like the one which took place on Tuesday, can progress and develop and it actively encourages participatory engagement from its users.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dfid-research-two-new-reports-from-panos-londons-relay-programme,News story,DFID research: Two new reports from Panos London's Relay Programme,Two new reports from Panos London's Relay Programme.,Department for International Development,29 July 2011,"A new case study launched by Panos London shows that media coverage of tuberculosis (TB) in Zambia can be improved by bringing journalists and researchers together to tackle the misconceptions and awareness around the disease.

The case study‘Reporting health research: Connecting journalists and TB researchers in Zambia’, shares some of the outcomes and lessons learned from a joint initiative betweenPanos London’s Relay programmeandTARGETS, a research programme consortium. The initiative brought together journalists, editors and health researchers to discuss the barriers to reporting and promoting public debate on TB. These included stigma around TB transmission, lack of access for journalists to reliable information and limited support from editors for health stories. Health researchers then acted as expert advisors to journalists who produced a series of national newspaper articles and radio programmes on both national and community radio.

Zambia has been reported as having the 10th highest TB incidence rate in the world (193 cases per 100,000 members of the population) and one of the highest rates of HIV infection in Africa, at 15% according to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID 2009). Misconceptions about the disease transmission and the link between TB and HIV infection has fuelled social stigma which can make people reluctant to disclose their status and less likely to seek treatment.

Panos London Executive Director, Mark Wilson said: “Evidence has shown that there is limited access to accurate information and knowledge about TB in Zambia. Media interventions can support accurate and informed reporting around TB that provides the missing links in knowledge and create debate on health issues. More importantly, informed and sensitive reporting can challenge misconceptions which can influence health behaviour positively and reduce the stigma associated with TB.”

Relay’s programme manager, Annie Hoban said: “Our workshops revealed that there is mistrust and fear between journalists and researchers but they recognised that there is real value in each other’s expertise and it was mutually beneficial for them to work together. There have already been great outcomes through this initiative. Four articles and five radio programmes were produced as a result, reaching more than 500,000 people combined. This case study shows a great deal can be achieved when journalists and researchers work together, and it’s an approach which can be applied to public health reporting in general.”

Anindependent review of the Relay programmetook place between October 2010 and February 2011 and included field visits to five programme focus countries - Uganda, Kenya, Malawi, Zambia and India - and over 60 interviews with project staff and beneficiaries.

The purpose of the review, which was carried out by ITAD, was to identify, synthesise and share the knowledge of the Panos Relay team and their partners after five years of project implementation to build the media’s capacity to report research.

The resulting synthesis report offers insights about how to work with project team staff and beneficiaries to articulate and better understand project logic and interventions through the use of participatory evaluation tools including problem trees, force fields, stakeholder analysis and most importantly, a theory of change.

It also highlights the varied and nuanced ways in which media coverage might have affects in the ‘real world’ such as feedback from readers, further media coverage, take-up of stories in mainstream media, stimulation of lobby activity, and changes in the way governments talk about an issue.

The report corroborates programme findings that work to build the skills of journalist and research and build new relationships between them, including breaking down negative stereotypes, can lead to improved capacity of media to report research and new media content that draws on research as a source to talk about critical development issues.

Finally, the report suggests a way forward for strengthening monitoring and evaluation in this and other research uptake capacity building programmes by showing the value of involving programme staff and beneficiaries in developing project logic and indicators of success, focusing on boundary partners directly reached by the project as central to determining and being part of the changes that take place. In doing so, the findings of the report should be of interest to other research, media and research uptake organisations.

Panos London recently launched anew websiteto offer practical information for researchers to communicate their findings and for journalists to engage with development research. The website offers resources, guides, case studies, reports, updates and monthly blogs for those interested in working with the media to report research. A key aim is to share learning and results from Panos London’s Relay programme and to highlight examples of exciting work in the field of reporting research."

He outlined how the Government of Afghanistan can use the deposits, currently valued between $1 trillion - $3 trillion, to raise domestic revenue and provide security, employment and access to basic services for their people.

He urged those international investors assembled to get involved.

“The UK government, through DFID, is helping to provide a comprehensive reform programme in minerals governance to create a stable, business-friendly policy and regulatory environment that encourages private investment. Gross domestic product growth in the country reached 22% last year.

“With the establishment of a favourable investment environment, we strongly encourage the global mining community to take full advantage of the economic opportunity in Afghanistan.

“By investing in Afghanistan you can all be part of the international effort to create a safer Afghanistan for all.”

The symposium was hosted by Afghan Minister for Mines, Min Sharahni, and chaired by Sir Hilary Synnott, former British high commissioner in Pakistan and deputy high commissioner in India. The audience included members of the international mining and business community.

Earlier in the week, Mr Shahrani and his delegation met with International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell and FCO Minister Alistair Burt, and held discussions underscoring the UK’s commitment to helping the Afghan government to improve the business climate in Afghanistan and encourage inward investment to help harvest the country’s mineral wealth to the benefit of the Afghan people."

‘Savile Row Field Day’ will showcase British wool in support of the Campaign for Wool, which is a coalition of industry groups raising awareness about the benefits of wool.

Mr Paice said:

“Wool is a high quality, sustainable and durable material with countless uses, some of which visitors will see here in Savile Row today.

“This event is a great opportunity to remind people about the benefits of wool and allow Londoners to see some iconic sheep on show from the West Country.”

Mr Paice joins organisers of Savile Row Field Day - the Savile Row Bespoke Association, Woolmark International, West Country woollen mill Fox Brothers and Dormeuil.

The field day is part of a wider five-year Campaign for Wool launched by HRH The Prince of Wales earlier this year to promote the benefits of wool.

Wool has many versatile uses in clothing, insulation, bedding, upholstery, construction materials, compost and carpets.  UK sheep produce some of the best wool for carpets and rugs and 70 per cent of the wool produced here is used in this way, such as making the world famous Axminster Carpets.

The UK flock is the largest in the EU with 15 million breeding sheep and 52,000 producers. There are approximately 32 million sheep and lambs in the UK from 60 different breeds.  The 35,000 - 40,000 tonnes of wool produced each year provide an additional income for farmers producing meat.

Wool production has a long history in the UK. British wool was cherished during Roman times and the industry was one of England’s greatest national assets during the 12th century. British wool now makes up three per cent of world wool production, with Australia, New Zealand and China making up the bulk of production."

Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman confirmed the money will help fund pioneering projects which focus on delivering benefits for the natural environment such as reducing the destruction of habitats and the loss of plants and animals through tackling the fragmentation and degradation of forests. This will help demonstrate how money for international climate finance can best deliver additional benefits - this is critical if climate, biodiversity and development objectives are to be tackled together.

Speaking at the Nagoya conference in Japan, where 193 countries are setting new targets to protect the natural environment, Mrs Spelman said:

“Tackling deforestation is critical if we are to be successful in our goals to protect biodiversity, tackle climate change and reduce global poverty.

“Forests are home to over half of the world’s plants and animals, and support the livelihoods of over one billion people, while deforestation accounts for almost a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions.

“With so much at stake, the UK Government believes it’s time to establish a substantial and longstanding financial commitment to REDD+ to protect the world’s forests and the plants and animals that live in them.”

The funds will help developing countries achieve sustainable, low-carbon development and prepare for the effects of climate change. Last week, the UK government announced that it will provide international climate finance of £2.9bn from 2010/11 to 2014/2015 of which this £100m is a part.

The UK is working with other governments at the biodiversity conference in Nagoya, and the climate change conference in Cancun, to ensure that the aims of tackling climate change, reducing global poverty and protecting and improving the natural environment are linked to ensure all three objectives are met."

David Green will take up his appointment when the current Director, Richard Alderman, steps down in April 2012. His appointment is for 4 years. The appointment follows an open competition.

Dominic Grieve said:

I welcome David Green’s appointment to this key post. He joins at a challenging and exciting time for the Serious Fraud Office. The government is committed to a better and more coordinated approach to economic crime and is putting the structures in place to effect this. TheSFOwill play an important role in this new strategy, working with Economic Crime Command partners and energetically pursuing the corruption and fraud which cause so much damage to victims, to law abiding competitors and to the UK’s wider economy and reputation.

I would also like to pay tribute to Richard Alderman. TheSFOhas been transformed under his leadership, becoming more effective, proactive and pragmatic. Richard has also pursued positive engagement both domestically and internationally and leaves the organisation more influential and outward facing.

David Green said:

TheSFOis here to stay, and I am delighted to accept the Attorney’s offer of a 4-year contract as Director. TheSFOharnesses all the specialist skills needed to tackle serious and complex fraud and bribery under one roof. Its cases have a high profile and a major public interest element. It is recognised as a major national and international agency and brand.

Importantly, it will contribute to our economic recovery by working to ensure a level playing field in the markets and underpinning the maxim ‘my word is my bond’. Over the next few years, theSFOwill play a crucial role in the developing anti fraud strategy."

100 tonnes of bottled water will be distributed to people living in the Ibaraki prefecture, following an urgent request from the Japanese authorities.

Damaged infrastructure in areas badly hit by the earthquake and tsunami has led to restrictions in the availability of clean drinking water, while concerns remain around radiation levels.

The water will be sent from Hong Kong and is due to arrive in Japan today.

International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell said:

“Over two weeks on from this terrible disaster, many people are still in the midst of a crisis. The destructive nature of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami has damaged essential infrastructure and left many without water.

Britain is stepping in to help Japan to cope with this shortage, providing much-needed support at this difficult time.”

The UK Government’s specialist search and rescue team has returned to the UK today following their relief mission to Japan.

Greeting them at Manchester airport, International Development Minister Stephen O’Brien praised the team for their courage and professionalism in Japan.

Following a direct request from the Japanese authorities, the team of 59 rescue specialists, two rescue dogs and four medical staff spent three full days searching two towns in Northern Japan - Ofunato and Kaimaishi - where tens of thousands were missing. Using their specialist search equipment and rescue dogs, the teams worked quickly to search for any survivors.

The earthquake and the tsunami had left a trail of devastation across a wide area of north-eastern Japan. Despite an extensive search of both towns and their surrounding areas, no survivors were found.

Stephen O’Brien, International Development Minister said:

“We are all proud of the British search and rescue team’s professionalism, dedication and courage. Through their vital work, Britain was at the forefront of assisting Japan in the aftermath of this terrible disaster.

“Despite cold, hard conditions they worked relentlessly to search for survivors in the utter devastation of the earthquake and tsunami, providing much needed relief Japan’s own exhausted disaster teams.”

Pete Stevenson, UK International Search and Rescue Commander who led the team on the ground in Japan said:

“The swift acceptance to the request for international assistance enabled the UK to be the first search and rescue team working in the worst affected areas.

“The towns of Ofunato and Kamaishi were devastated by the earthquake and resultant tsunami. The work carried out by the team has been extremely challenging and arduous. As ever, they performed their tasks with the utmost professionalism and skill.

“Whilst no survivors were found the assistance given by the UK team was greatly appreciated by the Japanese.

“Our thoughts are with the Japanese people and we wish them every success during the recovery and humanitarian response phase.”

The UK Government’s Search and Rescue team in Northern Japan have completed their search of Kamaishi town today.

Despite an extensive search of residential and industrial properties, no survivors have been found.

Heavy snow and falling temperatures six days after the start of the disaster mean there is now is an extremely low chance of finding survivors.

Therefore following a discussion with the Japanese disaster authorities, the UK team and their US counterparts have agreed not to extend their rescue operations and will begin to withdraw from Japan.

The team remain fit and well and continue to monitor radiation levels closely. No abnormal radiation has been detected in the area.

Andrew Mitchell, Secretary of State for International Development said:

“We are all extremely proud of the work of the UK Fire and Rescue team. Sadly, the chance of them finding further survivors is now extremely low and so their specialist skills are no longer necessary in Japan. We have therefore agreed with the Japanese authorities that we will withdraw our team.

“I am proud that despite very difficult conditions, the UK Fire and Rescue service’s dedication and professionalism was able to help Japan in its hour of need.”

Earlier this week, the team also completed a search of Ofunato. Several bodies were detected, but no survivors were found.

The team was dispatched to Japan following a direct appeal from the Japanese authorities. The British Government team, including 59 UK fire service search and rescue specialists, two rescue dogs and a medical support team, joined the international relief effort in Japan.

Update from Alan Downes, from Kent Fire and Rescue Service, one of the members of the UK’s International Search and Rescue team in Japan:

“We’ve seen total devastation in the areas affected. It’s so significant, I struggle to comprehend how any community can move on from it. But people here are getting on and dealing with what’s put in front of them.

“My only other deployment was to Sumatra. There was a lot of devastation but nothing on this scale - the difference being, in Indonesia, it was individual properties being destroyed, whereas here, whole communities have been affected by the tsunami.

“We’ve been working systematically to search a significant area and establish any survivable locations. We speak to locals to ascertain likely numbers of casualties and people missing. One lady took us to an area where her friend was missing. We tunnelled under rubble and sent in dogs - but after two hours we concluded it was not a survivable area.”

The UK team returned to their base at 1830 local time today and are awaiting further instructions from the Japanese authorities.

The British Government search and rescue team returned to Ofunato at 0530 local time this morning to clear the final sector which had not been cleared yesterday. No survivors were found.

The team then travelled 30km north to Kamaishi, where 1,000 people are reported missing.

In heavy snow, the team immediately started to search the central industrial and residential areas which had been badly affected by the earthquake and the tsunami. Three bodies were detected in the debris, but no survivors were found.

They returned to their base at 1830 local time and await further instructions from the Japanese authorities.

Pete Stevenson, team leader of the UK-ISAR team in Japan said:

“The UK-ISAR team are now working in Kamaishi which is 30 kilometres north of the base of operations and are working daylight hours only due to a lack of power. The UK team are working nearby to their colleagues from the United States and they are in radio contact with each other. Kamaishi still has 1000 people missing but so far the UK team have only recovered 3 deceased.”

International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell said:

“I spoke directly to our team in Japan this morning who have confirmed they are fit and well. I thanked them for their continuing efforts to help Japan in its hour of need.”

Expert scientific advice shows that there is no current risk of radiation contamination to the UK International Search and Rescue team, who are deployed more than 130 km away from Fukushima nuclear plant. No abnormal levels of radiation have been detected in the area. The team continue to monitor the situation in conjunction with the US teams and US military that they are deployed with.

Weather conditions on the ground are now deteriorating, with low temperatures and heavy snow is falling.

The UK ISAR team have set up their base in a school in Sumita, north Japan, near Ofunato, along with teams from the US.

This morning at 0600 local time the full team was deployed to the centre of the disaster zone in Ofunato. The team cleared a large industrial district and residential area. Although bodies were recovered, no survivors have been found so far. The team will now be tasked overnight with new operations.

International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell said:

“We are all proud of the UK’s search and rescue experts, who are doing a great job under tough conditions.

“They are working alongside Japanese colleagues to give much-needed help and support to that country in its time of dire need.”

The UK Search and Rescue team deployed by DFID have now arrived at their base, 20km outside Ofunato in the north east of Japan.

The British team will be working alongside US search and rescue colleagues and dogs.

Several members of the team have already carried out an initial assessment of the area earlier today. All teams will set out to begin search and rescue operations at first light tomorrow (0600 Japanese time, 2100 GMT 14 March).

Following a direct appeal from the Japanese Government earlier this morning, the British Government will dispatch a team of 59 UK fire service search and rescue specialists, two rescue dogs and a medical support team to join the international relief effort in Japan.

The team will fly from Manchester airport later this afternoon and travel directly to Japan as quickly as possible. On arrival tomorrow, they will immediately join the international search for survivors, providing relief for Japan’s own rescue teams.

This morning International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell met members of the UK’s International Search and Rescue (ISAR), just back from New Zealand.

Speaking to the BBC this lunchtime from Birmingham, he said:

“Our hearts go out to all those who are caught up in this dreadful disaster.

“I’ve spent time this morning with members of the British International Search and Rescue Team, who have just returned from Christchurch, where they were working with their Japanese counterparts on helping with the dreadful earthquake in New Zealand, and we have made it absolutely clear that if there is any additional or specialist expert help which we can supply, we will certainly do so.

“Japan has some of the best international search and rescue services anywhere in the world, so that at least is some minor comfort at this terrible time .

“What we’re doing now in the British humanitarian operations room, which has been active on this since very early this morning, is to hope for the best but to plan for the worst. We’re working closely with organisations like the International Red Cross as well as the international organisations which operate through the United Nations.”

The new British support will help Libyans to return safely to the homes and businesses they have fled. It will go through the Mines Advisory Group - known as MAG. It will contribute to:

MAG’s work continues to focus on areas worst affected by the fighting.

International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell said:

Millions of men, women and children across Libya are at risk from landmines. Many Libyans have been uprooted by the conflict and are unable to return to their homes for fear of unexploded shells and grenades.

With the support I have announced today, MAG will identify and dispose of unexploded material to prevent a secondary wave of death and injury as people return to communities in conflict-affected areas.

Public information on the risks is also vital, and will help to prevent children treating shells and grenades as toys and trophies, something that we have already seen can have tragic results."

The announcement follows previous flights earlier this month which successfully evacuated 6,195 Egyptians and 521 Bangladeshis on a total of 35 flights.

Andrew Mitchell, International Development Secretary, said:

“We have been clear from the start that so far this is a logistical challenge - but one where there was a real risk of things getting much worse very quickly. Our fast action on a first wave of emergency flights helped to stop numbers building in the camp at an unmanageable rate, with the increased risk of disease that would bring.

“But it’s clear that more assistance is now needed. That’s why we’re providing additional flights that will effectively double the number of people who will now be able to get back to their families while also relieving pressure at the border camp.

“And that’s why it’s vital that other donor countries continue to support these efforts and don’t take their eye off the ball now.”"
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/research-reports-on-bovine-tb-in-badgers-published,Press release,Research reports on bovine tb in badgers published,Research reports related to the control of bovine tuberculosis in badgers have been made public today.,"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs",8 November 2010,"Defra has made public supporting data behind the successful licensing of the first tuberculosis vaccine for badgers (Badger BCG), which was licensed by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate in March this year. The studies were carried out by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) and the Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera).

The laboratory studies with captive badgers demonstrated that the vaccination of badgers by injection with BCG significantly reduces the progression, severity and excretion ofMycobacterium bovisinfection.

A key finding of the field study, conducted over four years in a naturally infected population of more than 800 wild badgers in Gloucestershire, was that vaccination resulted in a 74 per cent reduction in the proportion of wild badgers testing positive to the antibody blood test for TB in badgers.

The blood test is not an absolute indicator of protection from disease, so the field results cannot tell us the degree of vaccine efficacy. While the findings indicate a clear effect of vaccination on badger disease, data from the laboratory and field studies do not lend themselves to giving a definitive figure for BadgerBCG vaccine efficacy. Nor do they provide information on the effect of badger vaccination in reducing TB incidence in cattle.

A scientific paper summarising the results of the injectable BCG badger vaccine research has been accepted for publication by the scientific journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B (Biological Sciences) and will be published shortly.

Professor Glyn Hewinson, Head of the TB Research Group at the VLA, and Professor Robbie McDonald, Head of the Wildlife and Emerging Diseases Programme at Fera, said:

“VLA and Fera are very proud to have conducted the programme of work on BadgerBCG and that a vaccine is now available for use in the field as one of the tools for tackling bovine TB. In making the data available today, we hope that people will be able to see for themselves the detailed research that went into the development of the vaccine and understand the opportunities and challenges of using vaccination.”

Defra is also publishing today the results of new computer modelling by the Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera), which has examined different strategies for controlling TB in badgers, including both culling and vaccination.

The results of the modelling were consistent with the conclusions of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial indicating that there were both positive and negative effects of culling. The modelling shows that badger vaccination could make a positive contribution to disease control in its own right and was consistently positive when used in combination with culling in a ring vaccination strategy.

The results of the modelling were that:

a) A combined strategy of vaccination in a ring around a culling area was more successful than the cull-only strategy, which in turn was more successful than the vaccination-only strategy, both in reducing the number of TB infected badgers and cattle herd breakdowns. Ring vaccination partly mitigated the detrimental effects of culling. However, the combined strategy requires about twice as much effort than either single approach done in isolation.

b) Culling of badgers should continue for at least four years to realise a clear benefit. However, low rates of land access for culling, or low culling efficiency, or the early cessation of a culling strategy was likely to lead to an overall increase in cattle herd breakdowns (whilst this is not the case for vaccination).

The results of the research has been published on the Defra website and is available at:http://www.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/animals/diseases/tb/

The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) issued an authorisation for BadgerBCG vaccine on 24 March 2010. VLA is the market authorisation holder and the vaccine is manufactured by the Statens Serum Institut in Denmark.

VLA is an executive agency of the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). It is a regional network of 16 veterinary laboratories including a central facility near Weybridge in Surrey.

VLA provides a wide range of applied research and consultancy on livestock diseases and surveillance of new and emerging diseases for the Government and animal health industry. It is also a national and international reference laboratory for many farm animal diseases including avian influenza, bovine tuberculosis, classical swine fever and TSEs.

The Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera) is an executive agency of Defra. Its remit is to provide robust evidence, rigorous analysis and expert professional advice to government, international organisations and the private sector, in order to support and develop a sustainable and secure food chain, a healthy natural environment, and to protect the global community from biological and chemical risks.

Fera has the largest group of wildlife management specialists in the UK. This along with extensive facilities and resources has positioned their scientists as leaders in wildlife management and disease control. Fera is responsible for the coordination of the Badger Vaccine Deployment Project.

The Coalition has committed to publishing a balanced and comprehensive bovine TB eradication programme early in 2011. In preparation for that a public consultation on our proposed approach to badger control is currently underway. The consultation document is available on the Defra website and closes on 8 December."

This will allow more investment in green technologies across the world and help stimulate private sector low carbon investment opportunities.

The UK’s support joins financial contributions from the European Commission, Germany, Norway, Australia and the United States, and will help up to 15 developing countries to set up market-based policies including better international crediting systems and domestic trading schemes.

Andrew Mitchell, the Secretary of State for International Development said:

“Establishing their own carbon trading mechanisms will allow developing countries to play their own role in reducing their carbon emissions.

“This funding will kick start innovative carbon programmes that will help poor communities cope with climate change challenges.

“By better harnessing the innovation of the private sector, developing countries will have the tools to create jobs and develop local solutions that will increase access to clean energy and improve the lives of the world’s poorest people”.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/paperless-trade-for-uk-businesses-to-boost-growth,Press release,Paperless trade for UK businesses to boost growth,Electronic Trade Documents Bill ends need for paper-based trading documents,"Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport and The Rt Hon Michelle Donelan",12 October 2022,"The Bill will make digital documentation legally recognised, reduce admin costs and make it easier for British firms to buy and sell internationally

Processing times for electronic documents cut to 20 seconds and carbon emissions reduced by at least ten per cent

British businesses will be able to trade easier, faster and cheaper around the world thanks to new plans to remove needless paperwork and bureaucracy.

The Electronic Trade Documents Bill, expected to be introduced in Parliament today, will boost the UK’s international trade, already worth more than£1.4 trillion, and will reduce the estimated 28.5 billion paper trade documents printed and flown around the world daily.

Business-to-business documents such as bills of lading - a contract between parties involved in shipping goods - and bills of exchange - used to help importers and exporters complete transactions - currently have to be paper-based due to longstanding laws.

Under the Electronic Trade Documents Bill, digital trade documents will be put on the same legal footing as their paper-based equivalents to give UK business more choice and flexibility in how they trade.

The Bill will modernise old legislation such as the Bills of Exchange Act 1882 and the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992.

Removing the legal obstacle to electronic versions of trade documents will significantly lower administration costs and is expected to provide a £1.14 billion boost to UK business over a ten-year period. It will reduce trade contract processing times from between seven and ten days to as little as 20 seconds, according toTrade Finance Global.

Digital Secretary Michelle Donelan said:

Our digital-first plans will make it easier for the country’s firms to buy and sell around the world - driving growth, supercharging our economy, cutting carbon and boosting productivity.

We want to support businesses by cutting red tape and allowing them to sell their goods and products globally without burdensome bureaucracy.

The UK was central to establishing the international trade system in the nineteenth century and we are once again leading the world to boost global trade in the twenty-first century.

The Digital Container Shipping Associationestimatesthat if 50 per cent of the container shipping industry adopted electronic bills of lading, the collective global savings would be around £3.6 billion ($4 billion) per year. The International Chamber of Commerce estimates that small and medium businesses could see a 13 per cent increase in international business if trade is digitised.

Elsewhere the World Economic Forum (WEF) has found that digitising trade documents could potentially reduce global carbon emissions from logistics by as much as 12 per cent. Electronic trade documents also increase security and compliance by making it easier to trace records - for instance, through the use of blockchain and distributed ledger technology.

International trade still relies to a large extent on a special category of trade document which is dependent on being physically possessed by a person, and transferred over to another person.

The UK is a world leader in digital trade but currently the law does not recognise the possibility of possessing electronic documents, which prevents industries going fully paperless. This is costly and inefficient.

This Bill will allow businesses to choose to use electronic trade documents but does not force them to do so - allowing them to use practices and processes which work for them. It will set a vital precedent for all sectors and industries using English law as a basis for international contracts, including across the Commonwealth.

Commonly used documents in the UK for the trade in or transport of goods which the Bill will enable to become electronic include:

The new rules will require trade documents in electronic form to meet certain criteria designed to replicate the key features of paper trade documents. This includes ensuring only one person, or parties acting jointly, can exercise exclusive control over it at any time, and removing the previous holder’s ability to exercise control over it once it has been transferred on.

The Bill will have its second reading when parliamentary time allows.

Chris Southworth, Secretary General, ICC United Kingdom said:

The publication of the Bill is a game changer with huge economic gains to be made for trade if companies digitalise systems and remove paper. Trade plays a huge role in the global economy so digitalisation is vital to establishing a more sustainable system.

Real time transactional data will enable us to gather far richer, more insightful information to help us track and monitor the flow of sustainable goods and finance across the system. This is simply not possible if information is held on paper documents

Ahead of the President of Niger’s visit to the UK next week, the International Development Secretary warned the crisis is reaching its tipping point with up to 1.5 million children facing imminent starvation in the next month if the world does not take urgent action.

He called on other donors - particularly those with strong links to the drought-stricken region of the Sahel - to follow suit and step up their efforts to avert this looming catastrophe.

Agencies need extra support to treat the effects of acute hunger before the rainy season makes vast swathes of West Africa inaccessible for aid workers. This will happen in as little as four weeks’ time.

Britain’s latest support includes nutritional treatment, health, water and sanitation for a further 31,000 children, and food for a further 170,000 people for six months.

It will also provide animal feed and vaccinations to keep over 280,000 farmers’ livestock alive and seeds and tools for 470,000 families so they will be able to feed themselves next year as well.

Britain is now helping a total of more than 1.4 million people at risk of hunger across Mali, Niger, Chad, Mauritania and Burkina Faso. More than 100,000 children at risk of starvation in these countries will receive immediate lifesaving treatment.

Andrew Mitchell, Secretary of State for International Development, said:

“Britain will not sit back while children starve to death in the Sahel.

“We took a lead in tackling the food crisis in East Africa and now is the time for others in the international community to step up.”

A deadly combination of conflict and poor harvests has pushed many families to the brink, with 8 million people in need of urgent assistance now, and with a further 10 million requiring additional support."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defra-pledges-over-1million-extra-funding-for-local-authorities-to-tackle-air-pollution,Press release,Defra pledges over £1million extra funding for local authorities to tackle air pollution,Local councils in England are set to benefit from over £1 million of additional Defra funding to tackle air pollution.,"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs",1 December 2011,"The extra support was announced today in a speech given by the Environment Minister, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, at the Environment Protection Conference in London.

In October, Lord Taylor announced that 51 councils across England would receive £2 million for a range of projects designed to reduce the levels of air pollution in our towns and cities.

Defra will be talking directly to local councils to identify which projects could benefit from today’s extra funding to help reduce Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) emissions.

Environment Minister Lord Taylor of Holbeach said:

“Although the quality of the air that we breathe has improved considerably, reducing air pollution is still one of our greatest challenges.

“That is why I am pleased to announce today that we are providing just over £1 million of further funding to support these projects and to improve the local framework for delivering air quality improvements.

“Local authorities continue to play their part in improving air quality and this extra Government support builds on the £2 million of Air Quality Grants for research and interventions to support air quality improvements that I announced in October.”

Eligibility for these new grants is limited to English local authorities with one or more Air Quality Management Areas for NO2 or those authorities where the Government’s national air quality assessment in 2009 identified a high level of NO2 emissions in their area.

It is hoped that these projects will lead to significant reductions in NO2 emissions over the next twelve months in those areas where an urgent improvement is required.

Local authorities who are successful in gaining this funding will be required to provide Defra with a progress report by September 2012 to monitor the success of each project and prove the money is being spent effectively.

In his speech Lord Taylor also announced the launch of a revised and improved Air Quality Index (AQI) from January 2012.  The Air Quality Index is used to communicate the current and forecast levels of outdoor air pollution and provides details about what the public can do to reduce exposure.

Lord Taylor added:

“We have reviewed the way in which we inform the public about air pollution, which includes updating our Air Quality Index to bring it in line with current health evidence and to make it easier for people, particularly those susceptible to the effects of air pollution, to understand the impacts of air pollution on their health.

“I can therefore announce that we will be launching a new and significantly improved version of the Index in January 2012.”

Notes

Defra has pledged an amount of £1.186 million of further funding to local authorities to tackle air pollution.

The Air Quality Grant Programme helps support the delivery of local air quality action plans required under Section 84 of the Environment Act.

The original fund of £2m was very heavily oversubscribed and therefore some projects had to be cut back and other projects could not be funded.  The additional funding will allow other projects to be funded where they offer good value for money and also to provide additional funding to support projects that were not fully funded in the first round allocations.

Further information on the Air Quality Grant programme is available athttp://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/air/air-quality/laqm/grants/.

Similar to sun and pollen indexes the Air Quality Index uses a 1-10 index divided into four bands (‘Low’, ‘Moderate’, ‘High’ and ‘Very High’).  The Index provides details about air pollution levels and appropriate actions for the public and susceptible groups.

Mrs Spelman also announced that an independent panel of experts will examine forestry policy in England and report back to her in the autumn.

Speaking in the House of Commons the Environment Secretary said:

“I would first like to say that I take full responsibility for the situation that brings me before the House today.

“Let me make it clear that we have always placed the highest priority on preserving access and protecting our forests. But the forestry clauses in the Public Bodies Bill, published well before we launched the consultation, gave the wrong impression as to the Government’s intentions.

“That is why I am today announcing three steps which will allow for more measured and rational debate about the future direction of forestry policy.

“First, I have taken a decision to end the consultation on the future of the Public Forest Estate and I take full responsibility for that. I am doing so because it is quite clear from the early responses to the consultation that the public and many MPs are not happy with the proposals we set out.

“Second, the Government will support the removal of the forestry clauses from the Public Bodies Bill, currently at committee stage in the House of Lords.

“And thirdly I would like to announce that I am establishing an independent Panel to consider forestry policy in England. It will report to me with its findings this autumn. The Panel will advise me on the future direction of forestry and woodland policy in England, on the role of the Forestry Commission, and on the role of the Public Forest Estate. The Panel will include representatives of key environmental and access organisations alongside representatives of the forestry industry. I will shortly publish its membership and terms of reference.

“If there is one clear message from this experience, it is that people cherish their forests and woodlands and the benefits they bring. My first priority throughout this period of debate has been securing a sustainable future for our woodlands and forests.  On many occasions in the House last autumn, Ministers gave assurances that our aim in all of this has been to do more to maintain and enhance the public benefits delivered by forestry - from recreational access to wildlife protection; from tackling climate change to sustaining a wide range of small businesses. That is why my ambition to provide a better future for our forests is undiminished.

“We have already heard positive suggestions about how we can do this - for heritage forests and all other woodlands. We have spoken to the RSPB, the National Trust, the Woodland Trust, the Wildlife Trusts, the Ramblers and other groups. The Forestry Commission has itself acknowledged that change is needed and will of course be fully engaged in this process going forward, as I know they have many ideas to contribute.

“We have also been listening to MPs on all sides of the House many of whom have set up their own initiatives with local groups. We want to support them in this.

“Finally, I am sorry, we got this one wrong, but we have listened to people’s concerns. I would like to thank colleagues for their support through what has been a difficult time. I now want to move forward in step with the public. I hope that the measures I have announced today, signalling a fresh approach, demonstrate my intention to do the right thing for our forests and woodlands.”

Notes

The membership of the independent panel to look into forestry policy in England will be announced soon.

The research identifies these huge potential savings to UK businesses from what is known as ‘resource efficiency’ - using materials, energy and water more efficiently in ways that need very little or no investment. Improving resource efficiency is a key part of the transition to a green economy, providing benefits for businesses and the environment while boosting the UK economy. It also shows that the savings could be even greater when the potential from longer term investment is included. These savings could improve competitiveness and employment opportunities for British business.

Most of the potential low cost savings come from using raw materials more efficiently and generating less waste. This is calculated to offer an annual saving of around £18 billion. Energy (£4 billion) and water (less than £1 billion) efficiency make up the remainder.

Unveiling the research Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said:

“Moving to a green economy offers businesses opportunities to grow into the future. Becoming more resource efficient contributes to a business’s bottom line, increases profitability and their capacity to grow. In addition to improving competitiveness, businesses could reduce carbon emissions by 29 million tonnes a year; so it’s a win-win for business and the environment.”

The research shows that some good progress has been made by business in being more efficient in the way they use resources, but there are still considerable opportunities out there. It identifies the main barriers to taking the necessary action as behavioural, financial and a lack of information.

Richard Gillies, Director of Plan A at Marks & Spencer, said:

“From our own experience, going green is good for business as well as being good for the environment. Last year Plan A, our eco and ethical programme, made a profit of £50 million which has been reinvested back into in the business. We’ve achieved this by becoming more efficient - for example using less energy, less packaging and recycling more - and by opening up new streams of revenue.”

The Waste & Resources Action Programme (WRAP) has been working with businesses on resource efficiency. This partnership approach has led to the establishment of a number of voluntary agreements across different sectors all of which have secured financial and environmental benefits.

The research project, prepared by Oakdene Hollins, looks at the potential financial and environmental savings to UK businesses from improved resource efficiency. It uses updated figures to a similar project published in 2007 to calculate the total savings potential of £23 billion per year.

Key Facts

* The £23 billion potential identified is spread across all sectors, but with the greatest potential being identified in chemicals (c. £4 billion), metal manufacturing (c. £4 billion), power and utilities (c. £3 billion), construction (c. £3 billion) and road freight (c. £2 billion).

* The majority of the potential savings come from using raw materials more efficiently and generating less waste (c. £18 billion), the remainder from energy efficiency (c. £4 billion) and water efficiency (less than £1 billion).

* Further savings of about £33 billion a year could potentially be made through measures involving investments with a longer payback period - a total of some £55-£56 billion a year altogether.

* Realising all these (both short and longer term) savings would also cut UK greenhouse gas emissions by about 13% (90 million tonnes CO2equivalent) - so this is a win-win for the individual business bottom line and for the environment.

* Previous, similar research for Defra in 2007 identified potential resource efficiency savings to UK businesses of £6.4 billion a year - the much bigger potential savings identified in this new research results from new information on savings from waste prevention in manufacturing (‘lean manufacturing’).

* Around 20% of the original £6.4 billion potential has already been realised as businesses have used resource efficiency measures to remain competitive during the downturn.

* A survey for Envirowise found that almost three quarters (73%) of businesses say they have developed a more detailed knowledge of their spending and resource use as a result of the recession, and this ‘thrift shift’ is set to continue, with around 80% of respondents citing resource efficiency measures among possible legacies of the recession."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dfid-research-pastoralists-moving-with-the-times,News story,DFID research: Pastoralists: moving with the times,Pastoralists are changing the way they live and work in response to new opportunities and threats.,Department for International Development,16 March 2011,"Frequently depicted as in crisis, pastoralists are changing the way they live and work in response to new opportunities and threats revealing the resilience that pastoralists have demonstrated for millennia. Accessing new markets and innovating solutions to safeguard incomes, this often misunderstood and marginalised community is re-positioning itself to make the most of the East African economy.

Low levels of rain currently affecting many dryland areas in the Horn of Africa have renewed the proverbial warnings that pastoralist livelihoods are in crisis. The impact of continuing unpredictable climatic conditions follows the devastating drought in 2009 and a year of unusually good rains across the region in 2010. However, although insecure livelihoods and vulnerability in pastoralist areas are of real concern, depictions of pastoralists as victims of forces beyond their control, and dependent on relief handouts, fails to tell the whole story.

The pastoralist way of life - synonymous with irreversible decline, ‘crises’ and aid rescues - is poorly understood. And whilst the words ‘pastoralism’ and ‘crisis’ have become fused in the minds of many, there are positive signs of vibrant pastoralist livelihoods that debunk the usual reportage of pastoralists depicted as insecure, vulnerable and destitute.

New evidence and analysis of how pastoralists are continuing to adapt to changes in their environment will be presented at anInternational Conference on the “Future of Pastoralism”in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, during 21-23 March, 2011 co-sponsored by theFuture Agricultures Consortiumand theFeinstein International Center of Tufts University. The conference will shed new light on longstanding assumptions that pastoralism is in irreversible decline and will highlight the dynamics of change happening in pastoralist areas. The policy, legal and aid support required to improve the situation of the most vulnerable pastoralists will be outlined and discussed.

Evidence presented at the conference will include recent studies from pastoralist researchers. For example, Ethiopia, Africa’s richest country in terms of livestock numbers, has a burgeoning export market, with government plans to support even greater levels of livestock exports in the near future. This positive trend is having an encouraging impact on other parts of the region, with cross-border pastoralist trade in camels from Kenya to Ethiopia also increasing.

Other research demonstrates that pastoralism is the most productive use of highly variable rangelands, contributing 16 percent to Ethiopia’s national GDP. Livestock reared by pastoralists in otherwise marginalised rangelands very clearly add to national development and contributions can be strengthened even more with improved pastoralist access to rivers and grazing.

New market niches are also being developed by pastoralists. In Gode town, the former capital of the Somali Region in Ethiopia, the sale of camel milk originated from the modest efforts of a former pastoralist who wanted to sell a she-camel to pay local medical fees. Twenty years later, large camel herds are supplying the Gode milk market in so-called ‘milk villages’ on the outskirts of Gode. This alternative livelihood option is proving lucrative for ‘town pastoralists’, who use their income to purchase plots in town and build houses. Furthermore, keeping camels in towns has created new income for women, who are the predominant buyers of camel’s milk for selling in the market, as well as to restaurants.

During the 2009 drought, pastoralists in Laikipia, Kenya responded to the lack of grazing with a mix of traditional coping techniques to secure access to critical grazing resources. Pastoralists approached commercial ranchers as well as Meru and Kikuyu smallholder farmers living adjacent to the Mt. Kenya forest to graze their livestock to withstand the drought further north.

Failed by generations of unsuccessful state development plans and aid strategies, pastoralists have been let down because the real problems and issues they face have not been taken into account. A more accurate understanding of the processes of change happening within pastoralist areas, which are significant and complex, has been obscured by the perpetuated myths of pastoralism in crisis.

Understanding the complexity and potential for pastoralism is crucial to informing policies for securing the future of this age-old and resilient sector in sub-Saharan Africa."

At a press conference in Pretoria, President Zuma said:“For us education has to be the most important spin off. As government, we plan to host a 1Goal Education campaign summit on 7 of July on the sidelines of the semi finals in Cape Town. If implemented successfully, this project will enable 72 million children who do not attend primary school currently to do so. It will be one of the most lasting legacies of the 2010 World Cup and we urge all nations of the world and the private sector internationally to support this campaign.”

Her Majesty, Queen Rania Al-Abdullah of Jordan, Co-Founder of the 1GOAL campaign, said:“The World Cup Education Summit offers those children hope of a reprieve and the chance to go to school before the next World Cup in 2014. There have been many great goals in the history of football, but delivering education for 72 million children around the world could be the greatest goal of all time. This is a historic opportunity to end global poverty. I urge world leaders to go to South Africa and live up to their promises of universal education.”

Already over 8 million people have signed up to the 1GOAL campaign including Pele, three time winner of the FIFA World Cup with Brazil, and Cristiano Ronaldo, Real Madrid and Portugal. Organised by GCE and supported by UKaid from the Department for International Development, 1GOAL is composed of a large network of 100 international charities and non-profit organizations.

This is the first time a sporting event has hosted a political summit in the middle of it. The 1Goal Education Summit in Cape Town on July 7 will offer world leaders the chance to draw up a roadmap to ensure that every child is in school by the next FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Since the 1998 World Cup held in France, new international aid has helped 40 million children to go to school but 72 million children are still denied an education."

Free and open academic discourse underpinned by the values of freedom is fundamental to delivering benefits for humanity and the globe as we seek to address the most pressing challenges of our time.

The appalling invasion of Ukraine by Russia demands that we all take a stand and show our solidarity and support for innocent people in the face of such violence. In line with the government’s economic sanctions package, we have also taken the decision to suspend publicly funded research and innovation collaborations with Russian Universities and companies of strategic benefit to the Russian state. Our aim is to introduce measures that will negatively impact the Russian state, and individuals and organisations with strong links to the Kremlin, but not to sanction individual innocent Russian scientists or innovators with benign research interests.

We are therefore today taking action:

1. All payments for projects delivered through UK public research funds with a Russian dimension have been paused. I have commissioned an assessment, on top of the existing and strong due diligence processes of UK public research funders, to isolate and freeze activities which benefit the Russian regime.

2. We will not fund any new collaborative projects with Russia through our research and innovation organisations.

3. We have suspended existing government to government dialogue through our science and innovation network team in Russia including their collaborative science projects.

4. Where the UK is a member of multilateral organisations, we are working at pace with partners to respond appropriately – holding Russia to account for its actions while diminishing and isolating its influence.

5. We are standing up a £3 million package of support for Ukrainian researchers at risk. We stand with Ukraine, its democratically elected government and its brave people at this awful time."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/international-day-for-the-eradication-of-poverty-2010,News story,International Day for the Eradication of Poverty 2010,From poverty to decent work – bridging the gap.,Department for International Development,17 October 2010,"Around 1.4 billion people, including over 50% of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, live on less than $1.25 a day - the World Bank’s measure of poverty. And the recent financial crisis has resulted in 64 million more people living in poverty, compared to a no-crisis scenario.

In 1993 the United Nations declared 17 October as the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. It presents an opportunity to acknowledge the effort and struggle of people living in poverty and a chance for them to make their concerns heard, as well as reaffirm our committment to reducing extreme poverty and hunger.

This year’s theme focuses on illustrating ways in which access to decent work and opportunities for learning and training can be developed with people in poverty.

The case study below features Kaushalya, a tribal woman from Padhariya Rajadhar in central India, who was able to change her life around, from chasing monkeys for a living to getting children into school, thanks to the training she received.

Kaushalya, a 40-year-old mother of five children, lives in the village of Padhariya Rajadhar, in the state of Madhya Pradesh in central India. Born into a poor tribal family, unschooled, illiterate, and married off at 15, she earned a living chasing monkeys from the fields of rich farmers.

But Kaushalya was determined that her children’s lives would be different, so she insisted they went to the village primary school. Here Kaushalya was first nominated to join the school’s parent teacher association (PTA), and then found herself elected president.

The school was in a sorry state – teachers were often absent, many village children weren’t enrolled, or failed to turn up. There was no drinking water, clean toilets or decent lunches. And Kaushalya was disappointed to discover that, at meetings, she was expected to listen while others spoke.

But then Kaushalya was invited to attend training (under an Indian government programme supported by UKaid from DFID). Reluctant at first, she discovered during the course how, in her capacity as PTA president, she could actually improve things. She grew determined to transform her moribund school into one of the best in the region. Kaushalya began with a recruitment drive, using a theatre group which spread the message: “Let’s go to school!” This was followed by a door-to-door enrolment campaign.

In just three years, the number of girls in school more than doubled. Kaushalya then established regular checks to make sure teachers attended school as well. She then lobbied the village council to provide clean drinking water, and embarked on a school health programme. Soon, school lunches became more nutritious, with Kaushalya randomly tasting the food to make sure it was up to standard.

Eventually she even managed to convince government officials to upgrade her school to secondary status (the nearest secondary school was 40km away). Her success has broken many social barriers. Eating food from her kitchen or shaking hands with her is no longer the taboo it once was because of her tribal status. The villagers readily listen to her, and the local government authorities consider her a force to be reckoned with.

Kaushalya was trained by the Capacity Building for Poverty Reduction (CBPR) Programme, which has up to now trained another 21,259 grassroots government workers. Based on the success of this programme, the government of India has made a commitment to train another eight million workers across the country.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-direction-for-england-s-public-forest-estate,Press release,New direction for England’s public forest estate,Consultation document on the ownership and management of the 18% of England's woodland currently run by the Forestry Commission.,"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs",27 January 2011,"England’s best known historic forests will be protected for future generations under proposals announced by Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman today. The transfer of heritage forests such as the New Forest and the Forest of Dean to charitable trusts will mean walkers, riders and cyclists will still be able to enjoy them as they do at the moment.

The proposals are contained in a consultation document on the ownership and management of the 18% of England’s woodland currently run by the Forestry Commission.  The document lays out different approaches for different types of woodlands.

The plans make clear that these woodlands will not simply be sold off to the highest bidder. Instead they recognise that no two woodlands are the same and that no single ownership model is appropriate. The document suggests a mixed approach that would deliver benefits for users and taxpayers, and makes clear that public access and biodiversity will be protected.  The government will bring forward amendments to the Public Bodies Bill to ensure the public benefits the forests provide are protected.

The key proposals in the consultation document are that:

These changes of ownership will allow the Forestry Commission to focus on its key roles of responding to outbreaks of tree pests and diseases, regulating felling and setting standards for sustainable forest management. The proposals would remedy the situation where the Commission is the largest commercial operator in the sector it also regulates.

The Government has already committed to taking 15% of the public forest estate out of state control over the course of this parliament, generating up to £100million of receipts. The consultation paper launched today invites views on a range of ownership and management options for the remaining 85% of the estate.  This will be an open consultation and Government will listen to all responses before publishing its response in the summer.

Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said:

“State control of forests dates back to the First World War, when needs were very different. There’s now no reason for the Government to be in the business of timber production and forest management. It’s time for the Government to step back and allow those who are most involved with England’s woodlands to play a much greater role in their future.

“We want to move from a ‘Big Government’ approach to a ‘Big Society’ one, so that we can give different groups - individuals, businesses and civil society organisations - the opportunity to be involved in managing the natural environment.  And we will make sure that public access is maintained and biodiversity protected.”

On amending the Public Bodies Bill, Mrs Spelman said:

“The government is absolutely committed to the ongoing provision and protection of the public benefits provided by the public forest estate, and the consultation shows how we intend to achieve this. We will bring forward amendments to the Public Bodies Bill to create a strengthened framework to safeguard the natural and social capital our forests provide now and for future generations. This would apply to the powers of sale, lease and management of the public forest estate. The consultation proposes that conditions will be attached to leases so that access and other public benefits are protected.”

The public forest estate makes up 18% of all woods and forests and 2% of the total land in England. The estate delivers a wide range of important public benefits, which will be protected, such as supporting biodiversity, storing carbon, supplying timber and energy and providing access to green space for recreation and employment opportunities.  The Forestry Commission has long bought and sold land but any woodland sold under the new proposals would benefit from increased protection.

Pam Warhurst, Chair of the Forestry Commission, said:

“Ministers have set out a new vision for forestry in England that will require a fundamental shift in our thinking and how we work. The proposals provide an opportunity to think about forest ownership and sustainable land management in a new way and to engage a wider cross-section of society. The consultation will allow people to have their say and we encourage everyone with an interest to give us their views.”

The Forestry Commission will continue to provide expertise on a wide range of tree-related matters, including tree health, the environmental role of woodlands, the links with climate change mitigation and adaptation, and the social and economic benefits of forestry.

Reform of the public forestry estate is expected to take place over the next decade with the Government’s overall policy approach to domestic forestry being set out in the Natural Environment White Paper in spring 2011.

The consultation will run from 27 January 2011 to 21 April 2011. Details of the consultation can be found onNational Archives websiteor on the Forestry Commission website at:www.forestry.gov.uk/england-pfeconsultation

The proposals set out in the consultation are designed to protect public and environmental benefits:

a) We will secure continuing good stewardship by requiring adherence to internationally recognised standards of sustainable forest management as part of any leasing arrangements. These standards cover in particular, woodland design, conservation and enhancement of biodiversity and the well-being of local communities and forestry workers;

b) Statutory rights of way and dedications under the right to roam legislation will remain in place. Where there is currently permissive access, for example by bike and horse, we will seek to secure equivalent rights as part of any transfer to new owners and managers;

c) The Forestry Commission’s felling regime will remain in place, alongside the presumption of replanting. Any change of use will be subject to strict controls under the planning system. It is simply wrong to suggest that our forests will be chopped down for housing development or conversion into golf courses; and

d) We will seek to agree the continuing restoration of plantations on ancient woodland sites (PAWS) with any new owners and managers.

The Forestry Commission has always bought and sold land to achieve operational efficiency. In last ten years, they have sold 7,800ha and acquired 5,400ha of woodland.

Selling 15% of the public forest estate is part of Defra’s Spending Review settlement and will help to contribute to tackling the deficit.  The sites that will be sold will be woodlands where Forestry Commission activity adds the least in enhanced public benefit and do not contribute significant revenue to the running of the estate.

Any forest or wood for which a suitable offer cannot be achieved will continue to be part of the publicly owned forest estate.

This consultation focuses on the public forest estate in England. The woodland managed by the Forestry Commission in Wales and Scotland is the responsibility of the Welsh Assembly Government.

I have today published a public consultation on the future of the Public Forest Estate in England. A copy of the consultation document is available through theNational Archives websiteand  the Forestry Commission website at:http://www.forestry.gov.uk/england-pfeconsultationand I have placed copies in the libraries of both Houses.

The Public Forest Estate in England is around 258,000 hectares of Government-owned land managed by the Forestry Commission. It represents less than one fifth of the woodlands of England, with the majority of the remainder in private and voluntary sector ownership.  The estate was started at a time of national crisis after the First World War, with severe shortages of timber and a woodland resource depleted to less than 5% of the land area in Great Britain.

In line with the Government’s broad policy to effect a shift from Big Government to Big Society, the consultation sets out the rationale for reducing state ownership and management of forest resources. The status quo is not an option. There is a fundamental conflict of interest in the Forestry Commission’s role. It is the largest player in the commercial forestry sector, a sector it also regulates.

The Government’s approach to looking at new models of ownership and management of the Public Forest Estate in England will be underpinned by a set of key principles which are designed to protect public access and other public benefits that so many enjoy. The Government’s proposals, on which the consultation seeks views, are for a mixed approach which includes:

The Government is committed to the ongoing provision and protection of the public benefits provided by the public forest estate. The policy we are consulting on shows how we intend to achieve this.  We will ensure that the powers in the Public Bodies Bill reflect our policy objectives, so that the powers and duties within it are strengthened to safeguard the natural and social capital our forests provide now and for future generations. This would apply to the powers of sale, lease and management of the public forest estate. The consultation proposes that conditions will be attached to leases so that access and other public benefits are protected. We will consider:

The Forestry Commission will play an important role in supporting the wider forestry sector - through its regulatory, grant-giving, research and expert advisory roles - to provide a wide-range of public benefits.

The consultation relates to 85% of the Public Forest Estate. The remaining 15% is covered by the Spending Review settlement, announced in October 2010.

I am today publishing tightened criteria for those sales under the Forestry Commission’s programme to deliver £100 million in gross receipts during 2011-15. During 2010, the Forestry Commission’s asset disposal programme continued under criteria established by the previous administration. At the end of 2010, pending review of the sales criteria, Ministers withdrew some sites from sale. The new criteria have been amended to strengthen the protection of public benefits through the withdrawal from sale of woodlands with significant areas of unrestored plantations on ancient woodland sites."

A new global small and medium sized enterprise (SME) finance facility will be created to help nearly a quarter of a million businesses access capital over the next seven years, with at least a quarter of these loans for organisations headed by women.

Working with commercial banks, the fund will focus assistance on some of the poorest and most fragile countries in Africa and South Asia, such as South Sudan, Malawi, Liberia, Uganda, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Bangladesh and Nepal.

Secretary of State for International Development, Andrew Mitchell, said:

Entrepreneurs don’t want handouts. They want opportunities to help them pull themselves out of poverty. They need investment to build their businesses and create stable jobs. Using expert banking knowledge and new technology we will be able to kick start the engine of growth.

We have no chance of defeating global poverty unless we unblock commercial lending and allow entrepreneurs the chance to thrive in some of the most neglected parts of the world.

Lars Thunell, IFC Executive Vice President and CEO, said:

Small and medium enterprises are a vital engine of job creation in developing countries. Yet they face a huge financing gap - especially in Africa, where SMEs need three times more funding than is currently available. This facility will help narrow the gap, creating opportunity for entrepreneurs who need it most.

Many banks are often unable to fully assess the risks of investing, greatly overestimating the cost of a loan. For example, fees for lending were almost three times as high in developing countries compared to rich countries.

The new facility will share innovative technology and expert banking knowledge to strengthen the skills, systems and processes. This will include:

SMEs already employ two thirds of the total permanent work force in developing countries, but less than one third of all small businesses in Pakistan, Bangladesh and DRC have any deposit or credit account with banks. Being able to access finance will enable businesses to generate more jobs and help create a more prosperous and peaceful future."

The site is now subject to statutory controls to prevent or limit the spread of the disease. The Fish Health Inspectorate (FHI) at Cefas, acting on behalf of Defra has issued a confirmed designation prohibiting the movement of fish to, from and within the fishery complex.

Fishery equipment disinfection and movement control measures are also now in place and anglers must ensure that they comply with all biosecurity measures within the designated area.

The fishery owners voluntarily closed the affected water as soon as the disease problems began and reported the problem for further investigation.

KHVhas no implications for human health. It is nonetheless, a serious viral disease of fish, and is notifiable in the United Kingdom. KHV affects all varieties of common and ornamental carp (Cyprinus carpio) including carp hybrids and can result in high rates of fish mortalities.

Clinical signs of KHV disease may include white or necrotic patches on the gills, rough patches on the skin, sloughing mucous and sunken eyes. These signs usually appear when water temperatures are between 16 and 28 degrees centigrade. Anyone noting deaths in carp or carp hybrids, with signs of disease similar to those above, or have suspicion of notifiable disease in any aquatic animal, should immediately contact the FHI.

Anyone who imports, keeps, fishes for, or retails carp (common and ornamental) and carp hybrids should take precautions to prevent the spread of KHV.

Mr Mitchell has written to all institutions who last year shared around £3 billion from the UK aid budget to alert them to the ‘Multilateral Aid Review’, which will begin immediately.

Each organisation will be tested to ensure the UK is getting maximum value from its aid money. This will include an assessment of the relevance of each body to the UK’s objectives on poverty reduction and their ability to deliver results on the ground.

Organisations that demonstrate value for money and the greatest impact on poverty could receive a cash boost. Those that fail to meet the tough criteria could have their funding reduced or stopped altogether.

Speaking after sending the letters, International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell said:

Nearly half of the UK’s aid budget is currently spent through international bodies, like the UN and World Bank, and so it is right that we assess whether this is providing maximum value for money.

Many of these organisations will be crucial to our fight against poverty and that is why I want to direct money towards those bodies that share our aims and have a proven track record of delivering results.

There are over a billion people living in extreme poverty around the world. We believe it is our duty to ensure we get as much as possible out of every pound of British aid.

The International Development Secretary underlined Britain’s commitment to working with the most effective organisations to reduce poverty. Organisations that have a proven impact on the ground and take a results-based approach to their programmes could be rewarded with increased funding.

Mr Mitchell is concerned that some organisations do not provide full value for money, whether due to high levels of bureaucracy, overlaps with other agencies, high costs or a failure to deploy enough staff into the field. There is also concern that many multilateral organisations fail to provide hard evidence to show money is being used effectively."

In transferring to the Home Office sponsorship, theNFAwill be even more effectively placed to influence this significant element of the crime agenda.

TheNFAwill continue to run Action Fraud as well as working closely with the Cabinet Office on a programme to reduce levels of fraud across the public sector."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/campaign-launched-to-fill-global-shortage-of-midwives,News story,Campaign launched to fill global shortage of midwives,Nearly 48 million women give birth every year without a midwife or birth attendant according a Save the Children report titled Missing Midwives.,Department for International Development and Sir Stephen O’Brien,1 April 2011,"Almost 48 million women - one in three - give birth around the world every year without expert help, and of them two million deliver their babies completely alone - often with devastating consequences, according to Save the Children’s new research published to coincide with Mother’s Day on April 3.

TheMissing Midwivesreport reveals that pregnant women frequently give birth at home without a midwife with only a dirty blade to cut the umbilical cord and herbs from a traditional healer to try and combat infection.

In some countries, cultural reasons mean that husbands sometimes deter their wives from seeking any help at all, leaving them to face the riskiest moment of their lives alone. As a result, 1,000 women and 2,000 babies die every day from birth complications which could be easily prevented, the agency said.

Save the Children, which is launching a celebrity-backed campaign for more midwives, estimates that if the global shortage of 350,000 midwives was met, not only would many mums be saved, but more than a million more newborn babies would survive every year instead of dying from easily preventable problems.

Marking the occasion held at the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists, Steven O’Brien, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for International Development said:

“It is nothing short of a disgrace that, in the 21st century, one of the most dangerous things a woman in the developing world will do is get pregnant.

“The UK is committed to ensuring that more women in developing countries are able to give birth safely attended by trained staff, particularly midwives and others with midwifery skills. By 2015 we will support at least two million safe deliveries in the world’s poorest countries and we are working hard to improve access to quality maternity services for all women in the developing world.

“Women and girls are at the top of the UK’s aid agenda and the work of organisations such as Save the Children is vital in helping us to achieve the best results for them.”

UK aid is supporting the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology to provide emergency obstetric care training to midwives and doctors in five target countries. By the end of 2010, 2000 healthcare providers had been trained.

TheUK’s Framework for Results for improving reproductive, maternal and newborn health, which was published at the end of last year, clearly demonstrates the Coalition Government’s commitment and international leadership on these issues.

UK aid will save the lives of at least 50,000 women in pregnancy and childbirth and 250,000 newborns by 2015 and work to ensure pregnancy and childbirth are safe for mothers and babies by supporting at least two million safe deliveries ensuring long lasting improvements in quality maternity services, particularly for the poorest 40%."

Billions in additional international funding has already been committed under the UK’s COP6 presidency for adaption and resilience, as climate-linked disasters become more frequent

The UK will today (Monday 8 November) convene ministers from across the globe to urge action within the next decade to make our world resilient to the impacts of climate change, at COP26 Adaptation Loss and Damage Day.

UK International Champion on Adaptation and Resilience for the COP26 Presidency Anne-Marie Trevelyan will lead the meeting, as the world faces increasingly frequent and severe extreme weather and natural disasters.

In 2021 alone, climate change is believed to have contributed to devastating drought in southern Madagascar, flash flooding in Germany and China, and wildfires in Greece and the US, leading to loss of life and livelihoods. Developing countries and small island states are the most acutely at risk.

Even if we get on track to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, we will still need to deal with increasing impacts like these. More investment and faster action to help vulnerable countries adapt to climate change and minimise and address loss and damage is needed well before 2030 to prevent further catastrophe and suffering.

To support global efforts to tackle the impacts of climate change, today the UK will announce new funding totalling £290 million, including:

This comes in addition to almost £50 million in new UK support announced in the first week of COP26 to help small island states develop resilient infrastructure to withstand climate shocks and support capacity-building for their access to funding and technical solutions.

Speaking ahead of today’s event, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, UK International Champion on Adaptation and Resilience for the COP26 Presidency, said:

We must act now to stop climate change from pushing more people into poverty. We know that climate impacts disproportionately affect those already most vulnerable.

We are aiming for significant change that will ultimately contribute to sustainable development and a climate resilient future for all, with no one left behind.

CDC, the UK’s development finance institution, will also announce plans today to join a group of donors in committing to substantially increase investments in climate adaptation and resilience to support vulnerable developing and emerging countries.

This builds on the launch last week of a new ‘Clean Green Initiative’ by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to help developing countries take advantage of green technology and grow their economies sustainably. To support this, the UK will deliver over £3 billion in climate financing over the next five years, including £200 million for a new Climate Innovation Facility to scale-up technologies to help deal with the impacts of climate change, such as drought-resistant agriculture and sustainable forestry, in markets where private investors have been reluctant to take on the risk alone.

Today’s UK announcements build on new pledges amounting to billions of pounds in support for vulnerable countries from other developed nations, including Australia, Canada, Denmark, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and the US. Further pledges are expected today.

Alongside new state commitments, today’s event will also see representatives from frontline communities given a platform to share their experiences of climate impacts and showcase solutions being implemented on the ground.

Emily Bohobo N’Dombaxe Dola, facilitator of the Adaptation Working Group of the official youth constituency to the UNFCCC, YOUNGO, will speak at today’s event. She said:

I was drawn to climate action after seeing first-hand the impacts of climate change on local coastal communities in Senegal, both impacts already there and those yet to come.

It is the socially marginalised and geographically vulnerable across both Northern and Southern societies that already suffer the most due to natural disasters and shifting weather patterns, from working-class and refugee communities, through to people with disabilities, the elderly, women and young girls.

Yet, I have encountered countless displays of resilience by these communities and local actors. Now it is time for governments and donors to level up on equitable finance and plans for loss and damage and for adaptation.

Building on existing collaboration as co-chairs of the Adaptation Action Coalition, the UK and Egypt are expected to confirm plans to work together to drive further action on adaptation ahead of the next UN climate change conference in 2022.

Over twenty foreign, climate/environment, planning, or finance ministers are expected to join the Adaptation Loss and Damage Day ministerial session, including Bangladesh, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Dominica, Egypt, the EU Commission, Fiji, Germany, Ghana, Grenada, India, Italy, Kenya, Malawi, Morocco, Nepal, the Maldives, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Slovenia, Sudan, St Lucia, UAE, Uganda, the US.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-calls-for-peat-to-be-phased-out,Press release,Government calls for peat to be phased out,A consultation on proposals to phase out the horticultural use of peat by amateur gardeners in England by 2020 has been published today.,"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs",17 December 2010,"Important progress has been made in reducing peat use in growing media products over recent years, but there is still a long way to go.  The consultation also sets out a new long-term goal to eliminate peat use by all gardeners, growers and procurers by 2030 at the latest, by switching to more sustainable, peat-free alternatives.

Natural Environment Minister Richard Benyon said:

“The horticultural industry has made real progress in reducing peat use, but I want to see peat eliminated from the amateur gardener market by 2020. We need to go further if we are to protect our natural environment and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

“This will be challenging, but more sustainable and good quality peat-free alternatives are already available, and I believe it is achievable for peat to be phased out in all markets before 2030.”

The consultation includes proposals to:

A wide range of interested parties are being consulted, including DIY retailers, garden centres, growing media manufacturers, Local Authorities and Non-Government Organisations.

The consultation responses will feed into the Natural Environment White Paper that will be published in the Spring.

1. The consultation closes on Friday 11 March 2011 and can be found atarchive.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/peat/index.htm

2. The UK currently uses three million cubic metres of peat per annum for horticulture.  69 per cent of this is used by amateur gardeners and 30 per cent is used by professional growers.  As peat is effectively a non-renewable resource, the extraction of peat for horticulture is unsustainable, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and damage to rare habitats and archaeology.

3. The consultation paper proposes to differentiate between the different products (e.g. soil improvers, growing media) and sectors (e.g. amateur gardeners, professional growers, the public sector) for the first time, to reflect the markedly different costs, challenges and opportunities associated with reducing peat use in these markets."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/progress-on-europe-wide-ban-on-illegally-logged-timber,Press release,Progress on Europe-wide ban on illegally-logged timber,A ban on illegal timber entering the EU market has moved a step closer this week.,"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs",17 June 2010,"Currently it is not against the law to sell timber in the EU that was chopped down illegally in its country of origin. However, the Council of the EU has signalled its approval for legislation that will close this loophole by putting a ban on illegal timber entering the EU market.

Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said:

“Illegal logging leads to deforestation which is a major contributor to climate change, harms wildlife and has an impact on the economies of developing countries and the livelihoods of local people.

“The UK has been supporting strong EU measures to rid illegal timber from our market and getting this agreement is a priority for the coalition. We have been building support with like-minded European countries, the timber trade and NGOs to agree strong measures.

“We need to make it an offence to bring illegal timber into the EU and cut off the markets through which it can be sold. The Council of the EU backing this measure is a massive step forward.”

The “Due Diligence Regulation” would make it illegal for timber which was not logged in compliance with the law of its country of origin to enter the European market. Those placing timber on the market will be required to exercise due diligence to help achieve this aim.

The Council has passed its decision to the European Parliament, which is expected to vote on its agreement next month before a deal is finally agreed by Ministers.

Illegal logging fuels corruption in some of the world’s poorest countries and results in an estimated $10-15 billion lost revenue a year. It also undermines the ability of developing countries to promote timber as a sustainable resource.

Approximately two billion people worldwide are dependent on forests for some part of their livelihoods.

The UK imports approx 72% of its timber needs, accounting for 6% of the global timber trade (for construction, household products, paper and increasingly energy). WWF estimates that 7.2% of UK imports could be illegal."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/india-passes-one-year-without-polio,News story,India passes one year without polio,The country celebrates a whole year free from the crippling and potentially fatal disease that targets young children,Department for International Development and The Rt Hon Andrew Mitchell MP,13 January 2012,"Today India celebrates a whole year free of any new cases of polio - the crippling and potentially fatal disease that targets young children.

The milestone follows a step up of India’s own vaccination programme in recent years backed by UK aid through the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.

Video: BBC News -Report on India’s polio vaccination drive



The announcement is a major step towards global efforts to wipe out polio forever - defeating the disease in one of the toughest countries in the world.

Two years ago, India recorded more polio cases than any other country. However, it has overcome huge challenges to stop transmission, including its large population and hard-to-reach communities.

Reported cases of polio fell from 741 in 2009 to zero this year. The success is due to intense and continued immunisation drives - particularly focussed in high-risk areas - as well as ongoing monitoring and surveillance of cases.

National Immunisation Days - which occur twice a year - helped protect over 170 million children under five years old across the country with oral vaccines. To reach people on the move, mobile vaccination teams immunised children at railway stations, inside running trains, at bus stands and market places.

The breakthrough is a result of India’s decision to expand its own vaccination programme, including polio immunisations. This commitment from the Government of India also means more UK support can be directed elsewhere, helping to counter outbreaks in other countries across Africa and Asia.

Experts at the World Health Organization say the remarkable progress demonstrates that polio eradication can be achieved anywhere in the world.

International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell said:

Britain is at the forefront of the fight against polio and India’s success is proof that aid spent on vaccinations prevents disability and saves lives.

Through Britain’s increased support to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative last year, an additional 45 million children worldwide are being vaccinated against this crippling disease.

In the last 20 years, polio cases have been reduced by 99% - largely thanks to the work of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. The disease is now close to being only the second in history - after smallpox - to be wiped out.

However, polio remains active in more than a dozen countries, crippling and killing many children. Last year the Prime Minister announced a doubling of the UK’s support to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, to help reach over 90 million children in 2011-2012 and continue the progress made so far."

They affect development by making land and other renewable resources unusable for growing food or generating income, and blocking market routes and infrastructure development projects.

Landmines and explosive remnants of war jeopardise efforts to improve health, education and poverty and therefore prevent countries achieving the Millennium Development Goals.

Welcoming the United Nations International Day for Mine Awareness, Secretary of State for International Development Andrew Mitchell, said:

The UK supports mine action projects in many affected countries around the world. I saw for myself the impact of this vital work while on a visit to Somalia.

Mine action entails more than removing landmines from the ground. It includes actions ranging from teaching people how to protect themselves from danger in a mine-affected environment to advocating for a mine-free world.

We’re proud to support the incredible work of British organisations such as the HALO Trust and Mines Advisory Group (MAG), as well as other international actors, such as the UN’s Mines Action Team.

Following the conflict in Libya, UK aid has helped the Mines Advisory Group (MAG)to clear explosive remnants and teach people about the dangers of unexploded ordnance - including grenades and ammunition - that still pose a threat to thousands of people across the country.

In Afghanistan, Britain is supporting the HALO Trust to clear mineslaid during the conflict with Russia in the 1980s. The ongoing work means local farmers in Herat are able to reclaim vast swathes of fertile land - once made a no-go area by the dangerous explosives - and begin to grow their crops once more.

The SAC will be re-modelled based on the recommendations of the independent report.  Although it will remain a Non Departmental Public Body, it will have a strengthened role in supporting the Chief Scientific Adviser in the oversight of all Defra expert scientific committees.

Professor Bob Watson, Chief Scientific Adviser for Defra, said:

”The reformed Science Advisory Council will be in a stronger position to provide independent advice to Ministers and to me on the science underpinning a wide range of Defra policies.

”I would like to thank the current SAC members for the valuable contribution they have made to Defra. It is vital that we continue to benefit from the expert independent advice the SAC provides and I look forward to working with the new committee.”

The changes include the standing down of the 12 current members of the SAC. 7 new members, with expertise over a broad range of issues for which Defra is responsible, will be recruited over the next few months.

Greening explained how doctors, nurses, surgeons, anaesthetists and other supporting medical, nursing and paramedical staff can now pre-register on the UK’s International Emergency Trauma Register (UKIETR) to join the UK’s international humanitarian response to overseas emergencies such as tsunamis, earthquakes and floods.

Justine Greening said:

The UK public has always given generously to appeals in the aftermath of natural disasters overseas. And UK expert volunteers have been there at the forefront when the world needed them: following the Indian Ocean tsunami and the earthquakes in Haiti and Japan.

Now medical personnel can sign up to the UKIETR to help after serious natural disasters. This is one way the UK can help to stop problems spiralling out of control and also helps us to develop our own disaster resilience.

The UKIETR will help to coordinate the deployment of volunteers. This will ensure personnel have the correct skills, training and experience necessary to provide safe, effective and appropriate treatment in challenging and fast-moving circumstances.

The register is designed specifically to respond to situations where surgical expertise is required and will mean that the UK provides a timely and coordinated response to rapid-onset disasters.

This adds to the government’s existing capacity to deploy trained Search and Rescue experts from Britain’s fire services - as seen following the Japan, New Zealand and Haiti earthquakes.

Medical charity UK Med first launched UKIETR in January 2011, and surgical team members from their register have deployed in support of NGO operations in Haiti, Libya and Tunisia. DFID and the Department of Health have worked with UK Med to incorporate the register into the UK’s overseas disaster response.

DFID support for the UKIETR will see over 400 medical personnel registered and trained by 2014.

Incorporating specialist teams to enhance the UK’s humanitarian response was a recommendation of Lord Ashdown’s Humanitarian Emergency Response Review (HERR) in 2010."

“Britain is leading the way in helping the world’s poorest people, with a firm commitment to spending 0.7 per cent of GNI on aid from 2013. The UN Secretary General has praised Britain’s ‘visionary leadership’ on this.

“Now is the time for other countries to step up and keep their promises too. We will push for that - and I will push for all aid to be more transparent and more accountable.”

The International Development Secretary is pushing governments across the world to agree:

Huge strides have been made since the MDGs were agreed a decade ago with more children in primary schools, more communities benefiting from anti malaria bednet protection and a ten-fold increase in access to HIV treatments.

These successes demonstrate the MDGs are achievable with strong international support.

Andrew Mitchell will attend a number of high level events in New York this week as part of the MDG summit. He will attend meetings focusing on, amongst other issues, malaria, maternal health and education."

The pupils from Holy Family Primary School and Hazlewood Primary School showed International Development Minister Alan Duncan and Northern Ireland Minister of State Hugo Swire projects they have been working on as part of a school linking programme with children in Uganda and Sri Lanka.

They then took the chance to quiz Alan Duncan on the UK Government’s commitment to get 9 million primary age children from the world’s poorest countries into school over the next five years.

Alan Duncan, Minister of State for International Development, said:

“I was extremely impressed with the hard work and commitment shown by the children of Holy Family and Hazlewood to their projects. Their knowledge and enthusiasm really stood out when we were discussing their friendships with their peers in Uganda and Sri Lanka.

“We enjoyed a lively debate about how the UK Government can help some of the 67 million primary age children not in education in the developing world.

“They were encouraged to learn that over the next five years the UK Government will help 9 million of the poorest children in the world into primary school - 50 times the entire primary school population of Northern Ireland.”

The Global Schools Partnership scheme is funded by the UK Government and managed by the British Council and supports twinning arrangements between schools in the UK and schools in developing countries.

These partnerships support teachers to better teach young people about poverty in developing countries and motivate their commitment to a fairer, more sustainable world.

On top of the commitment to get 5 million children into primary school by 2015, UK aid will also help train more than 190,000 teachers and increase the UK Government’s focus on educating girls in conflict and fragile states."

Stephen O’Brien said:

Congratulations to the students for making such an extraordinary film. It is important that young people understand the issues that shape the world they live in. The film is an excellent tool which will enable them to understand what life is like for young people in Africa, many of whom are affected by poverty.  We need to engage our young people on complex issues such as global poverty so that they can make their own contributions.

Student Hollie Anderson, aged 17, from winning Kesteven and Grantham Girls’ School said:

Winning feels like such an achievement, although it isn’t so much about what it meant to us but what it could mean to others. We are excited about the film being shown to our whole school, and also being used as a peer education tool in the UK.

GSF Founder Nick Pollard said:

We received 29 entries, representing a lot of careful and creative work from UK sixth formers.  However, Kesteven and Grantham Girls’ School’s idea was outstanding - scoring best for engagement, effectiveness, originality and achievability.

The Global Student Forum’s (GSF) Media partnership challenge is supported by DFID to teach young people about development issues such as the reasons why 9 million children die every year from preventable diseases like diarrhoea and malaria.

The students’ winning film will also be shown at this year’s GSF which is taking place on the 29 June at the Emmanuel Centre in London. Over 500 students from the UK are expected to attend. This year’s theme is looking at the issue of access to education and the 72 million children in the developing world who are not currently in school."

Asked whether the Prime Minister welcomed discussion of tax policy, the PMS said the Deputy Prime Minister was setting out his policy priorities and that increasing the Personal Allowance was a Liberal Democrat manifesto commitment, and a a commitment in the Coalition Agreement. He said there was a process for taking decisions on tax as part of a Budget and there would be discussions, including the Deputy Prime Minister at that time.

Asked if the Prime Minister and Chancellor had seen the speech before delivery, the PMS said they had seen it.

Asked if the Deputy Prime Minister was calling for the Personal Allowance to be greater than £10,000, the PMS referred the lobby to the text of the speech.

Asked if the proposal on the Personal Allowance could be characterised as an economic stimulus measure, the PMS said the Deputy Prime Minister was not proposing a change in the fiscal stance and referred the lobby to HM Treasury for further technical information.

Asked about whether the Prime Minister believed there was no hope for Doha trade talks, based on his speech to Davos delegates earlier, the PMS said the Prime Minister had said a year previously that 2011 was the crucial year for Doha, but progress had not been made. The PMS said the Prime Minister was saying the UK was not turning its back on multi-lateralism and needed to continue working with the World Trade Organisation. The PMS said the Doha talks were still on the table.

Asked whether the Prime Minister felt the Government had irritated the Argentine Government with comments on the Falkland Islands, the PMS said the Government’s position on the issue had not changed and it had not said anything different in recent weeks to what had been said previously.

Asked whether there was a link between falling police numbers and statistics on violent crime, the PMS said the Government did not believe there was a direct relationship between every pound spent in Government and outcomes, and that there were opportunities for savings to be made in the police as in other public services.  In the police service, there was considerable scope to make efficiencies in backroom functions without harming front line operations.

Asked about the Scottish Government’s proposed referendum question, the PMS said the UK Government was holding a consultation asking for people’s views on the question or questions to be posed and would listen to views expressed in that consultation.

Asked about whether the Bank of England could act as lender of last resort for an independent Scotland, the PMS said this was one of the issues that would need to be addressed in the debate over independence and that Danny Alexander gave a speech exploring some of these issues at the end of 2011, including the risks of having monetary union without fiscal union."

The PM also said that recent events such as the death of bin Laden and the Arab Spring mean that there is a “moment of opportunity” in the region.

…this is a moment of opportunity to continue the work to defeat terrorism in our world, to continue the expansion of democracy, civil rights and freedom across the Middle East and North Africa, and we also believe an opportunity to push forward the process of peace between Israel and Palestine.

Following their dinner a Number 10 spokesperson said:

The Prime Minister made clear in the meeting that Britain remained a staunch friend of Israel. Britain would continue to work closely with Israel to prevent Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon and on the wide range of regional security issues.

Prime Minister Cameron said we faced a moment of opportunity in the Middle East. He said that this strengthened the case for meaningful Israeli engagement in the Israeli/Palestinian peace process. Progress would help cement Israel’s long term security and reinforce prospects for democracy and moderation in the region.

The leaders discussed today’s announcement on Palestinian unity. Prime Minister Cameron said that any new Palestinian government must reject violence, recognise Israel’s right to exist and engage in the peace process, and that Britain would judge it by its actions.

The leaders also discussed plans for wider bilateral cooperation between Israel and the United Kingdom on economic and security issues."

The PMS also referred the reporter to some of the statements from energy companies who were investing in nuclear and were confident that new power stations of various types would be coming on stream to meet demands towards 2018.

Asked what happened over the weekend in regards to confusion over free milk for children under five, the PMS said that every government department was looking at various ways of saving money and this particular scheme was one of those that was looked at.  The Prime Minister had made his views about this scheme clear.

Asked if No 10 looked at the proposal, the PMS said that she would not get into process; Ministers across departments were looking at various projects, large and small, but that didn’t necessarily mean they came across the desk of the Prime Minister.

Asked if the Prime Minister had asked to see more documents as a result of what happened at the weekend, the PMS said that as departments were looking at ways of saving money there would be some difficult decisions to take, but that was all part of the ongoing discussions around the spending review.

Asked how the Prime Minister was able to make this kind of decision in the way he did, the PMS said that the Prime Minister did not want to cut this particular scheme; this policy had been in place since WWII and been an integral part of early schooling since that time.

Asked if the Prime Minister thought there was an argument for this scheme to be means tested, the PMS said that the decision had been made on this particular policy.

Put that evidence didn’t necessarily prove that giving milk to under fives had any health benefits, the PMS said that more broadly it was important to look at the impact on poorer and more vulnerable members of society, which was one of the presiding principles of the government.  In this instance the Prime Minister felt that keeping milk for under fives was an important part of that.Asked if there was a list of other things the Prime Minister had ruled out, the PMS said that there were a vast number of different initiatives and areas of government spending that were being looked at as part of the spending review.  People should wait for the spending review when the government’s programme on spending would be set out.

Asked if the Prime Minister shared the view that graduates should pay more for certain degrees, the PMS said that there was an ongoing review by Lord Browne into higher education and we would wait to see his recommendations.

Asked if the Prime Minister believed that local authorities should be able to suspend the right to buy council housing, the PMS said that the Prime Minister made his views about council housing clear last week in that we needed to ensure that people who were in need were helped.  There was a review ongoing and we were awaiting the outcome."

The PM said:

I strongly condemn the attack on the Israeli Embassy in Cairo. We have urged the Egyptian authorities to meet their responsibilities under the Vienna Convention to protect diplomatic property and personnel, including the Israeli Embassy in Cairo. They have reassured us that they take these very seriously.

The Egyptian authorities have previously said that they will uphold Egypt’s international agreements including its peace treaty with Israel.  We welcome this and look to Egypt to honour this commitment.

Asked if there was a need for the inside of passports to have a new design in this age of austerity, the PMS said that this particular project had been underway for some time, and security was part of the reason for a new design.

Asked what the Prime Minister thought of the Attorney General looking into the pathologist’s report on David Kelly, the PMS said that if the Attorney General felt that there was material new evidence then he could apply to the High Court for an inquest.

Asked if the Prime Minister wanted this issue to be resolved sooner rather than later, the PMS said that the Attorney General had a particular legal role and it was a matter for him.

Asked if the Prime Minister shared the Treasury’s concern that some of the plans coming from the Department for Work and Pensions were impractical, the PMS said he assumed that this referred to reports at the weekend about disagreements between the two departments.  There was a spending review underway and tackling the welfare bill would be a very important part of that.  This was something that both the Work and Pensions Secretary and the Chancellor understood, and discussions were ongoing.

Asked if the Prime Minister was concerned that there seemed to be some disagreement, the PMS said that discussions were taking place between the two departments, and the Prime Minister was concerned about the size of the welfare bill and how to tackle it.

Asked if the Prime Minister was still committed to seeing through promises made in the coalition agreement, for example on free bus passes, the PMS said that the coalition agreement set out the government’s policy and we would protect those things referred to in the agreement.  There was a spending review underway and it would take a hard look at the welfare bill and when that process had concluded there would be an announcement.

Asked if the Prime Minister had spoken to Patrick Mercer with reference to his suggestion that Irish republican dissidents planned to make an attack, the PMS said that he was not aware of any phone call.  We were not complacent about these things, but we would not provide a running commentary.

Asked if the Prime Minister thought that taxpayers’ money should be spent on glossy reports on human rights records around the world, the PMS said that it was something that we needed to look at and the Foreign Office had been saying as much; there was no question that we would be providing information on these issues, but in the current financial climate we should look at whether we published it in the most cost-effective way."

The one-day visit was Mr Cameron’s first as Prime Minister and comes as the UK seeks to forge a stronger relationship with Russia.

The PM, Foreign Secretary William Hague and Trade and Investment Minister Lord Green were joined by 24 British business leaders from companies such as BP, British Airways and Rolls Royce as part of a drive to increase trade between the two countries.

At the start of his visit, the Prime Minister delivered aspeech at the Moscow State Universitybefore holding talks withRussian President Dmitry Medvedevand Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.

Speaking about the trading relationship between the UK and Russia, the PM said:

Russia is resource rich and services light. Britain is the opposite. In fact Britain is already one of the largest foreign direct investors in Russia. And Russian companies already account for about a quarter of all foreign initial public offerings on the London Stock Exchange. So we are uniquely placed to help each other grow.

The Prime Minister added that one of the ways to achieve growth is by working together to create the best possible business environment for trade and investment, saying:

Today Britain offers Russia the strongest business environment in Europe and the lowest barriers to entrepreneurship in the world. We want to work with you to help strengthen Russia’s business environment too so more British businesses can invest here, creating more jobs and better value products for Russian consumers and more prosperity for us all.

We want to do everything we can now to build on this and take our trade and investment to a new level.

There are 600 British companies already operating in Russia where economic growth, at 4%, is well above the European average. Up to June 2011, UK exports to Russia were up by 63% to over £2 billion.

The trip builds on that success and will generate £215 million in new deals, creating almost 500 news jobs in the UK and safeguarding thousands more.

An agreement with Rosatom, Russia’s State Energy Corporation, is expected to help British companies bid for work on civil nuclear energy contracts. Together they could secure potential business worth upwards of £1 billion."

Stephen, 18, was murdered in a racist attack at a South London bus stop on 22 April 1993.

Speaking ahead of today’s memorial service, the Prime Minister also paid tribute to the Lawrence family for their tireless efforts in campaigning for justice.

The Prime Minister said:

The senseless killing of Stephen Lawrence in 1993 was a tragedy. It was also a moment that sparked monumental change in our society - change that has been brought about by the tireless efforts of Stephen’s family in challenging the police, Government and society to examine themselves and ask difficult questions.

I believe that many of those questions have been answered: from improved community relations to more accountability in policing. Much has been achieved, but we know that more still needs to be done. We owe this to the memory of Stephen."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/number-10-press-briefing-afternoon-from-3-november-2011,Press release,Number 10 Press Briefing - Afternoon From 3 November 2011,"From the Prime Minister's spokesperson on: UNISON, International Monetary Fund, G20, benefits and MPs' expenses.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street",3 November 2011,"Asked what the Prime Minster’s reaction was to the UNISON vote in favour of strike action, the Prime Minister’s Spokeswoman (PMS) said the decision was disappointing, unnecessary and potentially damaging. The deal on the table was fair and affordable, and the Government would urge unions to reconsider.

Asked how the strike could be damaging, the PMS said that the strike could potentially put the delivery of public services at risk. The PMS said the strike would make things very inconvenient for members of the public. The PMS added that strikes at this time are unnecessary and particularly when families are trying to balance their budgets they will have great difficulty understanding the need for strike action.

Asked if the low turnout strengthens the case for reforms of strike laws, the PMS said there are no plans. The PMS also referred journalists to the comments of Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude who said: “We have listened to the concerns of public sector workers about their pensions and yesterday responded with a new generous settlement which is beyond the dreams of most private employees. I urge the trade unions to devote their energy to reaching agreement and not to unnecessary and damaging strike action. Today’s UNISON ballot received a very low turnout - with less than a third of their members even voting - which shows there is extremely limited support for the kind of strike action their union leaders want. But it is extremely disappointing that some union members are still planning to lose a day’s pay and go on strike.”

In answer to further questions about why Government isn’t looking at reforming strike laws, the PMS replied that there are no plans to look at the laws and that it was important that unions looked at the deal on the table which is fair and affordable.

Asked if the Government could consider legal action to prevent a strike, the PMS said that there are laws that allow strikes and that the Government is appealing to the unions to look at the deal on the table.

Asked if the unions should re-ballot as the offer has changed, the PMS said that was a matter for the unions.

Asked if the new offer on public sector pensions could be withdrawn if strikes go ahead, the PMS said the Government has put out a generous but affordable offer which will be fair to public servants and we want them to look at that deal. The PMS added members of the public won’t necessarily understand why they are going on strike when those in the private sector often have less generous pensions.

Asked if the Government believes there needs to be a vote in Parliament on increasing contributions to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the PMS said the Government’s position on the IMF has not changed. The PMS said there will discussions at the G20 on the IMF and the Chancellor will be briefing journalists in Cannes. The PMS added that the Government is happy to look at whether resources need to be increased in the IMF, but at the moment there are no calls for that.

Asked if Conservative MPs should support the Government if there is a vote, the PMS said yes. She added that as the Prime Minster had said earlier today no country which has contributed to the IMF has ever lost out and that it is a really important organisation in terms of helping countries as part of the global economy.

Asked if a vote would be a three-line whip, the PMS said we are not there yet.

Asked for a readout of the bilateral meetings the PM had at the G20,the PMS said the Prime Mister had a meeting with Prime Mister Singh of India in which they discussed issues facing the global economy and the eurozone. They agreed momentum needs to be maintained by eurozone countries to implement the deal agreed last week. They discussed the need to make progress on global trade, and they also agreed to further the strong trade links between the UK and India and build on progress since their last meeting. The PMS said that the Prime Minister and Prime Minister Noda of Japan discussed the global economy and agreed on the importance that the eurozone made progress on implementing the deal agreed last week. Prime Minister Noda welcomed the Prime Minister’s report on Global Governance and said he looked forward to seeing the full report when it is discussed later this evening. They also agreed to build on the strong relationship between the two countries, particularly through trade, investment and defence co-operation. The Prime Minister expressed regret that his planned visit to Japan was postponed and said that he looked forward to rearranging his visit to Japan.

Asked if the Treasury are looking to reduce the increase in benefits, the PMS said the policy was set in the Budget and that remains the Government’s position.

In light of the latest publication of MPs’ expenses claims, asked if the Prime Minister thought it was important that those who would like to run the economy had their finances in order, the PMS said the Prime Minister thought it was very important for all MPs."

Asked if the Transitional National Council (TNC) was still based in Benghazi, the PMS said they were still based in Benghazi but their intention was to get into Tripoli soon.

Asked if the Prime Minister was meeting the TNC in Benghazi, the PMS said he had meetings with the leadership in Tripoli this morning and they were there at the press conference.

Asked why the Prime Minister had gone to Libya and what it was all about, the PMS said the primary purpose of that trip was to meet with the TNC to demonstrate and offer them our support in the process of transition.

Asked about discussions about a new Security Council Resolution, the PMS said it was to be discussed at the UN that day.  It was a new resolution which reflected the progress that had been made in Libya and it would do things such as putting in place a much more straightforward and simple process for unfreezing of Libyan assets, which at the moment had to be done by unanimous agreement.

Asked if it referred to assets all around the world or assets in the UK, the PMS said the draft text referred back to the previous Security Council resolutions, 1970 and 1973.  It would put in place an easier process for unfreezing the assets frozen by those resolutions.

Put that there was criticism that the UK was being slow off the mark in securing business opportunities in Libya, PMS said that there was quite a lot to be done to stabilise the country and the situation there, but it was true that getting businesses working again and getting the economy growing again would be important for the stabilisation of Libya.  If you looked at some of the things we were discussing at the UN, one was to lift the no fly zone so that at some point commercial aircraft would be able to operate again and that would help support the Libyan economy.  One of the other things we were working on was decommissioning  surface-to-air missiles, which was also important so that commercial flights could start to operate safely.

If you went back to the start of the Arab Spring, some of the fundamental issues people were complaining about were economic.  We would certainly be looking at the issue of trade and that would involve trade between Libya and the UK, but there were other priorities to support the process of stabilisation.

Asked about the Palestinian bid to be recognised as a state and whether Britain would support it, the PMS said our position was that we would want to look at the detail of the proposal but would be guided by whatever we thought best supported the Middle East peace process."

Writing in the Wall Street Journal today, Mr Cameron said:

[The trip will] provide a further step forward in UK-China relations, adding momentum to our commercial relationship and cementing an economic and political partnership that can help to deliver strong and sustainable growth and greater security for us all in the years ahead.

On this visit alone, Britain is set to sign new contracts worth billions of dollars involving companies across the UK and cities all over China.

Mr Cameron was welcomed by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao at the Great Hall of the People, where he inspected an honor guard before commencing the formal summit.

Over 40 specific agreements dealing with trade, low-carbon growth and cultural and education initiatives are expected to be signed over the course of the two-day trip. Deals already agreed include £750 million for Rolls-Royce to supply and service jet engines for China Eastern Airlines and the construction of 50 new English language schools by Pearson.

Such agreements will “help take Britain’s relationship with China to a new level”, said the Prime Minister.

Further highlighting the opportunities for British companies in China, the PM made an earlier visit to a Chinese branch of Tesco in south Beijing. The British food chain is planning to invest £2 billion in China as it expands from its existing 99 stores in the country.

Other issues being discussed at the summit include addressing global economic imbalances; the need for the completion of the Doha round of World Trade Organisation talks; progress on low carbon growth; and education co-operation.

Until they had done that, we would not comment on the matter, as it would not be appropriate.

Asked if Andy Coulson would step down as Director of Communications at No 10 if there were to be a new investigation, the PMS said that the current position was that there had been some allegations made, which the police would look at to see if there was fresh evidence on which to base a further investigation.

Asked if Andy Coulson had spoken to Ministers at the Home Office, the PMS said he was not aware of any conversations.

Asked if the Prime Minister had spoken to Andy Coulson about these fresh allegations, the PMS said that the Prime Minister spoke to Mr Coulson on a regular basis.

Asked if the Prime Minister had checked with the Met Police as to whether or not he was on the list of targets, the PMS said that we had not made those enquiries and there was no intention to do so.

Put that there were thousands of un-chased leads involved in this case, the PMS said that the investigation had already been reviewed by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). As set out in the Home Secretary’s statement, the DPP and CPS concluded that the investigation was proper and appropriate. The Select Committee for Culture. Media and Sport also looked at this and the previous government updated the House on the allegations in July 2009, and decided that they would take no further action at that point.

Asked if the Prime Minister was happy that Andy Coulson knew nothing about phone hacking activities, the PMS said that Andy Coulson had denied the allegations and the Prime Minister accepted that denial.

Asked what Andy Coulson was denying exactly, the PMS said that Mr Coulson had made a personal statement today. The allegation was that he had knowledge of phone hacking at the News of the World, something Mr Coulson denied. This was all a matter of public record and Mr Coulson had given extensive evidence to the Select Committee in the past.

Asked for the Prime Minister’s view on the tube strike, the PMS said that the two sides needed to get together and deal with it as quickly as possible.

Put that the EU Budget Commissioner had said that Britain’s EU rebate was no longer justified, the PMS said that we disagreed with him; we thought the rebate continued to be justified and in the absence of a rebate our net contribution to the EU would be around double that of France’s, and we didn’t think that that was acceptable."

The award was given to Hope UK in recognition of the impact their mobilisation has had on youth and communities.

Volunteers are trained with a 120-hour course including three practical training weekends. Working with children and young people in schools, youth groups, and faith groups these Drug Educators provide interactive educational sessions about alcohol, tobacco and drug misuse.

Hope UK’s achievements to date include:

Congratulating Hope UK on the award, Prime Minister David Cameron said:

Hope UK is an important initiative going in to schools and other young people’s groups to try and prevent drug and alcohol-related harm through education on their effects. The commitment shown by volunteers in undertaking a long training programme before they begin to start working with young people is particularly impressive and it is a credit to the team at Hope UK that they currently have 200 volunteers working around the country.

As well as helping young people to make positive choices it helps to build links within communities as local people work with groups in their area. I wish Hope UK all the best in continuing to grow and extend their services to even more young people around the country.

Accepting the award Sarah Brighton, Chief Executive Officer at Hope UK said:

We are honoured to receive the Big Society Award and would like to thank our volunteers and supporters for making this possible.

Hope UK’s sessions include life skills that enhance peer resistance and build confidence and are designed to encourage healthy choices and enable children and young people to realise their potential.

Further information: Hope UK was established in 1855 as the UK Band of Hope Union and has an unbroken history of work with children and young people. Its methods have changed with the times, but volunteers have always been central to its service delivery. In that sense, it has always been a part of the Big Society.

On the Big Society Awards:

The Big Society Awards were set up by the Prime Minister in November 2010. The aim is to acknowledge individuals and organisations across the UK that demonstrates the Big Society in their work or activities. In so doing, the aim is also to galvanise others to follow.

The award focuses upon three specific areas:

Launching the awards, the Prime Minister said:

There are some amazing projects and remarkable voluntary work going on in towns and cities up and down the country, by all kinds of organisations from large enterprises to tiny grassroots schemes and inspirational individuals.

These awards are a chance to pay tribute to those making a valuable contribution to their community, the real champions of the Big Society, but perhaps more importantly, I hope they will motivate many others to take action, get involved and drive change in their area.

Nominations come in from the general public after which there follows a process of scoring and short-listing by officials and a further short-listing by a Panel of Ministers and independent external experts. This Panel makes recommendations to the Prime Minister who then presents the final award. Around twelve winners are decided each quarter meeting and then announced throughout the year.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/department-business-plans-updated--5,News story,Department Business Plans updated,The government has published updated business plans for each government department with full details of changes made to the plans since they were first published in November 2010,"Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street",13 May 2011,"The 2011 business plans reflect an updated assessment of when the government will implement its commitments set out in theProgramme for Government.

They also now include actions on growth and social mobility, and some minor presentation changes, including incorporating milestones into the main section of the business plans.

Department Business plans set out in detail the work of the Government, and include data such as financial information, Structural Reform Plans and department priorities.

The Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and the head of the civil service, Cabinet Secretary Gus O’Donnell, first launched the departmental business plans in November 2010 setting set out in detail the work of Government for the next four years. The plans marked the start of a major change in the way government works by increasing accountability directly to the public.

Departments will continue to provide progress updates on their structural reform plans, which are part of the business plans. This will ensure that anyone can check that departments are meeting their commitments.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/number-10-press-briefing-morning-for-7-july-2011,Press release,Number 10 Press Briefing - Morning For 7 July 2011,From the Prime Minister's spokesperson on: News International and Aircraft Carriers.,"Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street",7 July 2011,"Put that the Deputy Prime Minister had said that there should be a judge involved in any inquiry and had the Prime Minister decided on the number of inquiries, the Prime Minister’s Spokesman (PMS) told the assembled press that we had not yet decided on the number of inquiries and that was something that needed to be worked through. The PMS said that that would need to be sorted out before we made a decision on who would lead those inquiries. The PMS added that the likelihood was that there would be two inquiries, with one looking at the police investigation and one looking at the wider issues relating to the media.

Asked if an inquiry could bleed in to the police investigation and could an inquiry be set up that would just look at the regulation of the press, the PMS said that these were the kind of issues we were thinking about.

The PMS said that we had some objectives; we wanted the public to have confidence in what we were doing; we did not want to have an inquiry that lasted for ten years and cost hundreds of millions of pounds; we wanted to make sure it was fully independent and that it got to grips with the real issues.

Asked if the inquiries would be held under the Inquiries Act, the PMS replied that we wanted to ensure that people had confidence in the process. We were thinking about this very actively now, but we needed to think through these questions.

On whether the Prime Minister was reviewing his relationship with News International and what his position was on delaying the BSkyB merger, the PMS said that on the second point, the Prime Minister did not have a position as that was a quasi-judicial process being dealt with by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. On the Prime Minister’s relationship with News International, the PMS said that Prime Ministers, Ministers and politicians met with people from the media all the time, including proprietors.

Asked if anyone at No10 was aware of Andy Coulson potentially being involved in what amounted to criminal activities before he was hired, the PMS said we did not have anything to add to what had been said in the past. The PMS said that the Prime Minister had answered multiple questions on Andy Coulson - he had now resigned from the Government and we did not have anything further to add.

Put that new allegations had come to light, the PMS said that the Prime Minister had answered those questions before himself.

Asked when the inquiries would be set up, the PMS replied that we would have to wait and see and the important thing was to get them right. The Prime Minister had made clear in Cabinet that urgent work was underway to set these inquiries up and that would involve some consultation with the Attorney General, party leaders, the Cabinet Secretary and others.

Asked to characterise the discussion in Cabinet, the PMS said that it had been a discussion that reflected similar issues raised in Parliament yesterday. The PMS said that there was clear agreement on what the Prime Minister had said yesterday and the action announced yesterday to set up an inquiry or inquiries. The PMS added that Cabinet was not discussing a specific proposal.

Asked if the issue of timing would rule out a judicial inquiry, the PMS replied that we were still working out whether this would be better as one, two or more inquiries. The PMS said that it was the Government’s stated position at the time of the Saville Inquiry that we did not want to repeat a process where an inquiry took a decade to complete and cost hundreds of millions of pounds.

Put that the Deputy Prime Minister had said there could be a case for a pause in the BSkyB deal, the PMS said that this was something for Jeremy Hunt to consider and he would not speculate on the process. Jeremy Hunt had to follow due process and if he did not, then that was something that could be challenged in the courts.

Asked if the idea of a pause had been discussed in No10, the PMS replied that this was not a discussion that would take place in No10. The PMS added that politicians were free to express opinions but the decision would rest with Jeremy Hunt.

Asked if the Prime Minister had any suspicion that his own phone might have been hacked, the PMS said he did not know, but would check.

Asked if any announcements on BSkyB would be made to the House, the PMS said he thought that announcements would be made to the market.

On whether the Cabinet Secretary and Attorney General had already had conversations about inquiries, the PMS replied that he did not know, but work was underway to address the issues.

Asked if contact with party leaders would be made before the summer recess, the PMS said that he thought that was a safe assumption.

Asked about the possibility of changing the law to enable a pause in the BSkyB deal, the PMS replied that that sounded unlikely.

When asked about who would be representing DCMS in any discussions about possible inquiries and would that not potentially represent a conflict of interest, the PMS replied that he was sure there would be discussions involving a number of different departments. Asked if that could cause conflicts, the PMS said that we would avoid any conflicts.

Asked if the Prime Minister had responded to the allegations that dead servicemen’s families phones had been hacked into, the PMS said that if this was true, it would represent a gross intrusion on people’s private lives and would be a truly appalling case.

Put that as the Prime Minister was still going ahead with the Police Bravery Awards today, was he making a distinction between the Sun and the News of the World, the PMS said that what the Prime Minister was doing today was celebrating police bravery.

Asked about News International hiring Lord MacDonald QC, the PMS replied that people should check with the Attorney General’s office.

Asked if the Prime Minister had any regrets about scrapping aircraft carriers, the PMS said that the Government thought it had made the right decision. The PMS added that we had inherited a plan to build two aircraft carriers which were not even inter-operable with our closest allies, the US and France, and with contractual obligations which meant that it was almost as expensive to cancel them as it was to build them. What we had been doing was tying to sort out that mess."

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-to-innovate-new-life-saving-treatment-and-diagnosis-technology,Press release,UK to innovate new life-saving treatment and diagnosis technology,"Diseases could be detected even before people experience symptoms, thanks to a pioneering new health-data programme as part of the Industrial Strategy.","Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, Department of Health and Social Care, Office for Life Sciences, UK Research and Innovation, The Rt Hon Greg Clark and The Rt Hon Theresa May",23 July 2019,"Diseases could be detected even before people experience symptoms, thanks to a pioneering new health-data programme as part of the government’s modernIndustrial Strategy.

Businesses and charities are expected to jointly invest up to £160 million, alongside a £79 million government investment, as part of the Accelerating Detection of Disease programme. The project will support research, early diagnosis, prevention and treatment for diseases including cancer, dementia and heart disease.

The pioneering initiative will recruit up to 5 million healthy people. Volunteered data from the individuals will help UK scientists and researchers invent new ways to detect and prevent the development of diseases.

Prime Minister Theresa May said:

Last year, I set out a mission to use data andAIto transform the diagnosis of chronic diseases and create a future where thousands more survive cancer; where a diagnosis means treatment and survival, rather than having to simply manage the condition.

Today’s announcement is another positive step forward in achieving this, as we work towards identifying more intelligent approaches to preventing disease and transforming the lives of patients and their families.

The programme – Accelerating Detection of Disease – has the potential to transform the way people are treated, supporting theNHSto continue to deliver the highest quality care for UK patients. Not only will this programme save thousands of lives, it has the potential to support developing industry in artificial intelligence, healthcare and diagnostics.

Business Secretary Greg Clark said:

There is no other programme in the world with the scale and ambition like that of our Accelerating Disease Detection challenge. Backed by government investment, we are aiming to use 5 million volunteers to discover new methods to tackle devastating illnesses before they take effect - and even before symptoms occur.

The business and charity investment expected alongside ours shows our modern Industrial Strategy in action, working alongside industry to ensure the UK remains a world-leader in medical discoveries that will save lives and benefit our economy.

Today’s business investment is an important step in delivering theAIand Data Grand Challenge missionto use data, artificial intelligence and innovation to transform the prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases by 2030. The programme is led by Professor Sir John Bell and brings together theNHS, industry and leading charities including Cancer Research UK, the British Heart Foundation and Alzheimer’s Research UK.

Leader of the programme Prof. John Bell said:

The Accelerating Detection of Disease programme will put the UK at the forefront of global research into early diagnosis and help us shift the standard in healthcare forever. We have a vision to live in a world where you prevent disease rather than treat it too late. The ability to identify people at risk or suffering from early forms of disease with greater precision will have a profound impact on how we develop diagnostics and new ways to treat disease. I am delighted that this challenge will bring together theNHS, charities and industry to develop a truly world leading resource.

Hilary Evans, Chief Executive of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said:

Alzheimer’s Research UK is delighted to play a part in this landmark cohort and harness this incredible resource to make breakthroughs possible for people with dementia.

Today, we diagnose dementia causing diseases after symptoms show, but to ensure people get the greatest benefit from future treatments, we must be able to diagnose them as soon as possible.

Alzheimer’s Research UK is working to revolutionise how diseases like Alzheimer’s are identified and uniting the best minds in digital data and technology to draw on the full potential of the Accelerating Detection of Disease cohort.

UKRIChallenge Director Fiona Watt said:

This is a wonderful opportunity for volunteers to support theNHSby participating in health research. The programme will  lead to new ways to prevent diseases or detect them at an early stage when they can be treated more effectively.

Professor Sir Nilesh Samani, Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation, said:

The British Heart Foundation is pleased to see the government confirm its commitment to the Accelerating Detection of Disease Challenge. This initiative could not only lead to exciting developments in detecting diseases at earlier stages, when they may be more amenable treatment and cure, but also better ways of preventing them. For heart and circulatory disease such as coronary artery disease, heart failure and vascular dementia the advances from this project could be game-changing and theBHFare delighted to be supporting and be part of this major initiative. Public endorsement, engagement and involvement with this project will be crucial and we also hope to support this aspect.

Sara Hiom, Director, Early Diagnosis and Health Professional Engagement at Cancer Research UK, said:

Cancer Research UK sees great potential in the Accelerating Detection of Disease programme, not only as a platform for research to further our understanding of the prevention and earlier detection of major diseases such as cancer, but as a way to engage the public more fully in their own health, increase their awareness of risk factors for disease and support our great health service.

The programme was a key commitment in thesecond Life Sciences Sector Dealand its use of genomics will change the future of health and medicine in a new era of precision healthcare. Putting genomics at the heart of this globally-leading initiative, delivers the government’s commitment to develop a genomic volunteers programme and contributes to our UK-wide ambition to sequence five million genomes by 2023 to 2024, maintaining our global lead in this field."
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-medicines-regulator-gives-approval-for-first-uk-covid-19-vaccine,Press release,UK medicines regulator gives approval for first UK COVID-19 vaccine,"The first COVID-19 vaccine for the UK, developed by Pfizer/BioNTech, has today been given approval for use following a thorough review carried out by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).",Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency,2 December 2020,"The decision by the UK regulatory authority was made with advice from theCommission on Human Medicines (CHM), the government’s independent expert scientific advisory body.
A dedicated team of MHRA scientists and clinicians carried out a rigorous, scientific and detailed review of all the available data, starting in October 2020.

This was done using a regulatory process known as a ‘rolling review’. A ‘rolling review’ can be used to complete the assessment of a promising medicine or vaccine during a public health emergency in the shortest time possible. This is done as the packages of data become available from ongoing studies on a staggered basis.

The MHRA expert scientists and clinicians reviewed data from the laboratory pre-clinical studies, clinical trials, manufacturing and quality controls, product sampling and testing of the final vaccine and also considered the conditions for its safe supply and distribution.

The National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, part of the agency, has been and will continue doing, independent laboratory testing so that every batch of the vaccine meets the expected standards of safety and quality.

We have carried out a rigorous scientific assessment of all the available evidence of quality, safety and effectiveness. The public’s safety has always been at the forefront of our minds – safety is our watchword.

I’m really pleased to say that the UK is now one step closer to providing a safe and effective vaccine to help in the fight against COVID-19 – a virus that has affected each and every one of us in some way - and in helping to save lives.

We are globally recognised for requiring  high standards of safety, quality and effectiveness for any vaccine. Our expert scientists and clinicians worked tirelessly, around the clock, carefully, scientifically, robustly and rigorously poring over hundreds of pages and tables of data, methodically reviewing the data.

Vaccines are the most effective way to prevent infectious diseases. They save millions of lives worldwide.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/friends-and-family-test-what-it-means-for-nhs,News story,Friends and Family Test: what it means for NHS,"Following the recent announcement by the Prime Minister of a ‘Friends and Family Test’ to be implemented in the NHS, in response to recommendations…",Department of Health and Social Care,31 May 2012,"Following the recentannouncementby the Prime Minister of a ‘Friends and Family Test’ to be implemented in the NHS, in response to recommendations by the Nursing Care Quality Forum, the Department of Health has issued more information about the test.

The Friends and Family Test (FFT) is an easy-to-understand question that will be asked of patients about the care they received.

It’s being introduced because we want NHS organisations to obtain regular and timely feedback from patients about the care provided in the NHS, take ownership of the results and act on the feedback.

This isn’t a new concept for the NHS: many hospitals are already getting regular feedback from patients and acting on it to improve services; some hospitals are using a simple question about overall experience of care as part of their patient feedback activity.

We want the public to be able to compare hospitals. To enable comparability we expect to have to ask hospitals to ask the same question and use similar methods.

We will work with the NHS over the coming months to develop the most appropriate question and method, building on the learning already available in many parts of the NHS.

It is important that the question we use is meaningful for patients, can discriminate reliably between good and poor services and drive improvements.

All providers of acute inpatient services, and A&E departments will be required to ask their patients the simple question.

The expectation will be that FFT will be implemented in all acute inpatient wards; there will be a few exceptions such as Intensive Care Units where it may be inappropriate to seek feedback from patients.

We will be requiring all providers of NHS funded acute inpatient services and A&E departments to deliver this from April 2013 and this will be a requirement in standard contracts.

Ward-level data and A&E department data based on this question will be published from April 2013.

The NHS should already be working towards meeting the requirements of the Operating Framework this year to actively seek out, respond positively and improve services in line with patient feedback. This activity is important, and should continue.

The development work the Department is doing with the NHS, SHA clusters and others such as the NHS Confederation and Foundation Trust Network, will result in a standard question being rolled out from April 2013. Trusts should be mindful of this when planning their patient experience work.

It is important to keep costs to a minimum so we will be working with providers and commissioners to determine the most cost effective method - but we will require an approach to enable patients to compare Trusts on a like-for-like basis .

Developing real-time patient feedback systems has been an expectation in the Operating Framework since 2008. Wherever possible NHS organisations will want to build on mechanisms already implemented eg existing real time feedback systems and surveys.

It is important that the question is asked of a sufficiently large sample size in each setting, in order to get statistical significance to enable comparability over time.

The approach to FFT implementation will be refined over the coming months as we work with the NHS and other key stakeholders, with further details being available in the autumn.

Many parts of the NHS are already very active in getting feedback from patients and using it to improve services. We will learn from their experience and work with SHA colleagues, providers and commissioners to help develop a common approach and standard question.

Ward-level data will be published from April 2013 on a locally determined basis. Providers and commissioners will be able to load up their Friends and Family score via the local profiles which already exist on NHS Choices.

We will be working closely with SHA colleagues and provider/commissioner organisations to determine other viable options for national publication of results.

Hospital level data will be comparable - patients will be able to rate hospitals and see which have improved or got worse. Due to the difference in size of hospitals, there may not be strict comparability across all wards or hospitals immediately as it will take some time to build up statistically significant data.

This will depend on the size of the organisation. It will be important that enough patients are asked the question so that the results are meaningful and representative so therefore we will not be setting central quotas.

To achieve a step change and allow publication of data from April 2013 there will naturally need to be some standardisation of approach. We will work with SHA colleagues, providers and commissioners to establish this. Many parts of the NHS have already developed good practice that can be drawn from.

This is not a new burden - many organisations already ask their patients for feedback, and this has been an expectation in the Operating Framework for several years. We are however working closely with SHA clusters on the detail of implementation and how to maximise its effectiveness in improving services and informing patient choice.

An initial meeting with SHA cluster colleagues is happening in early June to begin working through the details outlined above. We will provide an update via SHAs following this meeting. In autumn we will issue further updates on progress with the work underway with the NHS and other stakeholders on standardising the question and overall approach."

Biography

Professor Boyd has been Director of the Scottish Oceans Institute at the University of St Andrews and the Sea Mammal Research Unit, a partner institute of the Natural Environment Research Council, from 2001-2012. He was responsible for the creation of the Marine Alliance for Science and Technology for Scotland in 2009, a partnership of nine institutions conducting marine science across Scotland. He is a member of the Scottish Science Advisory Council, chairman of a scientific advisory board on decommissioning for Oil and Gas UK and he also chairs the committee that monitors the environmental compliance around Europe’s largest oil terminal at Sullom Voe in Shetland.

Much of his career was spent in polar science when he worked for the British Antarctic Survey from 1987- 2001 where his interests were focussed on the behavioural and physiological ecology of Antarctic seals and the ecology and management of the Southern Ocean. More recently, he was Chief Scientist for a US Navy study examining the behavioural responses of whales to military sonar and he was a co-developer of environmental risk management procedures used by the Royal Navy. He served on two inquiries into the future of Scottish Fisheries and the implications of Common Fisheries Policy reform for the Scottish Fishing industry and was recently a member of the Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force that recommended a global 50 per cent reduction in the level of fishing for some of the planet’s most abundant fish species.

Much of his recent research has focussed upon the effects of sound on marine life and this led to his role as co-chair of the International Quiet Oceans Experiment, a joint initiative of the Scientific Committee for Ocean Research and the Partnership for Observation of the Global Ocean.

The plans are contained in ‘The Natural Choice’, the first White Paper on the natural environment in 20 years, and are directly linked to the groundbreaking research in the National Ecosystem Assessment published last week that showed the strong economic arguments for safeguarding and enhancing the natural environment.

The White Paper also acts on the recommendations of ‘Making Space for Nature’, a report into the state of England’s wildlife sites, led by Professor John Lawton and published in September 2010, which showed that England’s wildlife sites are fragmented and not able to respond to the pressures of climate change and other pressures we put on our land.

Launching ‘The Natural Choice’, Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said:

“The natural environment matters to us all - not just because it makes us feel good when we stumble across a bluebell wood or spot a pair of goldfinches, but because we are now all able to see the terrible price we would pay if we lost what we have or neglected to care for it. Nature belongs to us all, and we’ve all got a vested interest in protecting it.

“That’s why the true value of nature should be built in to the decisions we make - as individuals, organisations, businesses and governments - so that we become the first generation to leave the environment in a better condition than we found it. This is what ‘The Natural Choice’ will help us all achieve.”

Key measures in the White Paper, which also takes forward recommendations contained in ‘Making Space for Nature’, include:

Reconnecting nature

Connecting people and nature for better quality of life

Capturing and improving the value of nature

The White Paper aims to improve the quality of the natural environment across England, halt the decline in habitats and species, and strengthen the connection between people and nature. The new way of looking at nature will help the growth of a green economy which treats natural capital in a responsible and fair way, encouraging businesses to use that capital sustainably. The actions contained in the Natural Environment White Paper will create a radical shift on how we view our natural assets by incorporating the natural environment into economic planning and ensuring there are opportunities for businesses that are good for nature and good for a strong green economy.

“In the past we have undervalued what our natural environment gives us,” Caroline Spelman added. “This White Paper changes that, because we cannot afford to make the same mistakes again.

“We can all gain from the economic, social, and health benefits nature gives us, but we need to recognise that if we withdraw something from Mother Nature’s Bank, we’ve got to put something back in to ensure that the environment has a healthy balance and a secure future.

“What I’d really like to see happening as a result of this White Paper is more children enjoying nature and continuing that interest into adulthood, so that they pass that passion for the environment down through the generations. That would be a legacy well worth leaving.”

Volunteering in health and social care

The Government recognises that volunteers already make a tremendous contribution towards the health and care services and support within their communities, improving the quality and choice of services available in our country. We want to ensure that this wealth of activity is recognised, celebrated and strengthened and that we nurture and release the capability and capacity that exist within our communities, including among those with health and care needs themselves.

The vision for volunteering in health and social care

Social action for health and well-being: building co-operative communitiesbuilds on theconsultation undertaken in 2008and joint work with key partners across the Voluntary Sector, local Government, NHS and the Trade Unions.

This refreshed vision, produced with the help of a cross-sector Stakeholder Reference Group, reflects health, public health and social care reforms.

This strategic vision highlights the valuable contribution volunteering and wider social action makes to every sphere of health, public health and social care, including prevention, the creation of people-centred and relationship-based services and improved patient and service user experience. It demonstrates how this in turn can help to develop support mechanisms and services that genuinely meet people’s needs, are more personal, built on strengths and community-owned.

The new Government £20 million business training scheme will bring new skills and business knowledge to rural areas, helping them take up new opportunities in the home and export markets.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said:

Having the right skills to run a business is crucial if budding entrepreneurs want to be successful. For too long the needs of rural business people have been overlooked. Those days are now over. Businesses in the remotest parts of the country will now have access to the best training so they can grow and help our country to compete even more in the global race.

Defra will meet 70 per cent of training costs through its Rural Development Programme for England with the remaining 30 per cent met by individuals or their employers.

Subsidised courses in subjects including business and management, market opportunities and information technology will be open to businesses and individuals. They will range from one-day workshops to industry-recognised qualifications and will be run on college campuses, in village halls, on farms and in business centres. The organisations providing the training will be able to tailor the courses to meet demand.

Mr Paterson is making the announcement on a fact-finding Rural Roadshow to Herefordshire. He will visit Herefordshire College of Technology, one of many colleges offering training in horticultural, agricultural and forestry skills as part of the scheme.

Rural Roadshows allow ministers to hear first-hand from rural communities and businesses what more the Government can do to support economic growth and help their communities to thrive.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-service-for-householders-to-stop-unwanted-advertising-mail,Press release,New service for householders to stop unwanted advertising mail,A package of measures will reduce the amount of unwanted advertising mail produced and cut waste through greater recycling.,"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs",1 November 2011,"Householders will have more control to stop the tonnes of unwanted advertising mail that drops through peoples’ letter boxes each year, Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman announced today.

A new free-to-use website is being set-up as part of a joint Defra and direct marketing industry deal so householders can opt-out of receiving all types of advertising mail. This replaces the current out-dated system, where households have to register on three separate websites or apply by post to stop the different types of unwanted direct mail from being delivered.

Under the new deal, a package of measures will reduce the amount of unwanted advertising mail produced and cut waste through greater recycling.

Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said:

“We’ve all returned home from holidays to be greeted by a mountain of unwanted, unsolicited mail waiting behind the front door, most of which is thrown straight out. These piles of paper irritate householders, waste businesses’ money and are environmentally unsustainable.

“That’s why I struck this deal with the Direct Marketing Association to give people more control over what gets posted through their letterbox but also to make sure the direct mail we do find useful is produced to higher standards and is fully recyclable.

“This also throws down the gauntlet to those companies hand-delivering brochures and fast-food menus to respect ‘no junk mail’ signs and only deliver what people want.”

Executive Director for the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) Chris Combemale said:

“We know that many types of advertising mail are welcomed by consumers, such as supermarket discount offers. Of course, untargeted and irrelevant advertising mail is not welcome. It’s this we want to eliminate.

“We’re keen to ensure that people are able to make an informed choice about whether or not they want to receive advertising mail. The new agreement we’ve struck with Defra will help to simplify how householders manage what they receive in the post.

“Unwanted mail is an annoyance and an unnecessary cost to business. By cutting this out we will also be helping to improve the environmental performance of the industry.”

The website, which is scheduled to go live in April 2012, is just one aspect of a wide-ranging agreement that Defra has struck with the DMA, the professional body representing the UK’s direct marketing industry. The current means of opting out include the Mailing Preference Service, the Your Choice Preference System and Royal Mail’s Door to Door opt-out service.

The three-year agreement will see the industry undertake a number of initiatives to contribute to the government’s plans to move towards a zero-waste economy.

By 2014, the amount of unwanted direct mail hitting door mats will fall significantly through the marketing industry increasing its current use of suppression lists - which includes opt-out, do not contact and gone-away lists - by 25 per cent.

Companies are also being asked to produce all direct mail from recyclable paper that has originated from a certified sustainable source, or made from recycled paper.

The DMA will develop a carbon calculator for paper direct marketing material by the end of 2013 so that businesses can see the carbon footprint of the direct mail they produce and deliver and take action to lower it.

The direct mail responsibility deal fulfils a commitment in the Government’s Waste Review announced in June.

Notes

The Responsibility Deal with the Direct Marketing Association can be found here:http://www.defra.gov.uk/publications/2011/11/01/direct-mail-responsibility-deal.

Further information on waste and recycling can be found here:http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste.

The opt-out website will be launched in April 2012 following consultation with industry members to ensure a smooth switch over between the current methods of opting out, and the new website.

Industry puts estimates for the current volume for direct mail at nine billion items of unaddressed mail and 1.7 billion of addressed direct mail.

The average household receives more than 300 items of unaddressed and 77 items of addressed mail a year.

According to Royal Mail 17.7m people bought from a posted catalogue last year.

380,000 tonnes of direct marking material were produced in 2009, of which almost 80 per cent was recycled.

The DMA’s carbon calculator will be based on the joint Defra/BIS/Carbon Trust PAS2050 standard for carbon footprint calculation."

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hepatitis-c-prevalence-falls-by-45-in-england,Press release,Hepatitis C prevalence falls by 45% in England,"UKHSA data reveals 70,649 people living with hepatitis C in England in 2022, marking a 45% decrease since 2015.",UK Health Security Agency,28 July 2023,"The latest data published by UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) shows that there were an estimated 70,649 people living in England with hepatitis C in 2022. This is 45% lower than the number of people in 2015, thanks to improved access to antivirals that cure the infection.

NHS England has treated more than 80,000 people since 2015 as part of its national elimination programme, meaning more people have now been treated and cured of the virus than are left to treat. Of those treated, more than 80% are from the most deprived areas in England, highlighting the role of eliminating hepatitis C as a key driver of reducing health inequalities.

Eliminating hepatitis C and hepatitis B is a key priority for bothUKHSAand NHS England, in order to reduce the impact of infectious disease in this country and to meet the World Health Organization’s elimination target by 2030.UKHSA’s strategy, including this hepatitis C target, was launched this week, setting out the organisation’s mission to prepare for, prevent and respond to health threats, save lives, and protect livelihoods.

Hepatitis C virus is a bloodborne virus that can cause life-threatening liver disease, including cancer. However, those infected often have no symptoms until many years later when their liver has been badly damaged. The virus is spread through blood-to-blood contact, most commonly in the UK by sharing needles contaminated with the virus – but even sharing razors or toothbrushes with someone with the infection could pass it on. People born in countries with higher prevalence of hepatitis C, such as in Eastern Europe and South Asia, or those who have had medical treatments abroad are also at increased risk.

While there has been huge progress over recent years in the diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis, challenges remain. While effective and curative treatments are available, the latest data fromUKHSAshows that a small but not insignificant number of successfully treated individuals become re-infected with the virus, so maintaining prevention services is critical.

UKHSAis working with partners to prevent, detect and treat the infection – for example, by working with regional operational delivery networks (ODNs).UKHSAhas enabledODNsto streamline their own data and focus on the remaining people that need to be found and treated.

Dr Sema Mandal, Deputy Director, Blood Borne Viruses atUKHSA, said:

Hepatitis C treatment has improved dramatically over recent years, but we need to identify people with the infection early to keep on track with elimination by 2030. Many people remain undiagnosed, often because they have no symptoms or are unaware that they have ever been at risk.

If you have ever injected drugs – even if it was only once or years ago – you could be at risk of hepatitis C. If you think you could be at risk, speak to your GP or do a test at home.

As part of its elimination programme, NHS England has expanded its range of options for finding the remaining cases of hepatitis C across all settings. Earlier this year, a free and confidential online testing portal was launched, enabling people to order an at-home testing kit to find out if they have the virus and receive treatment if needed. So far, more than 4,500 people have ordered testing kits, making it easier for those who might not have had access to existing service providers to get tested.

Anyone in England concerned they might have hepatitis C canorder a home test kit, or speak to their GP, local pharmacist or specialist drug and alcohol service.

Professor Sir Stephen Powis, NHS National Medical Director, said:

Finding and treating more than 80,000 people as part of our hepatitis C elimination programme is a huge achievement and I’m delighted that we remain on track to eliminate the virus as a public health concern by 2030.

Earlier this year we launched a new service on the NHS website to enable people to confidentially order at-home testing kits, and so far over 4,500 people have used this kit to get tested.

Hepatitis C treatment is simple to take and highly effective, with people usually cleared of the virus within 3 to 4 months. If anyone is worried they might be at risk, it’s never been easier to get tested and be treated, or receive peace of mind, at the first opportunity.

Health minister, Will Quince said:

The data speaks for itself. We are making huge headway in eliminating hepatitis C, with England on track to be one of the first countries in the world to do so.

Deaths and prevalence of the virus have fallen consistently thanks to improvements in diagnosis and access to treatments. We are at the forefront of tackling this serious disease, by swiftly procuring the best treatments and tackling inequalities through targeted screening and will continue to work towards the World Health Organization’s target of eliminating this virus by 2030.

Rachel Halford, CEO of The Hepatitis C Trust, said:

The progress towards hepatitis C elimination in England is extraordinary and demonstrates the importance of collaboration between affected communities, government, and healthcare professionals in order to achieve success.

As we get closer to the government’s hepatitis C elimination target date, there is still work to do to make sure that we don’t miss the target.

You can go many years before you experience any symptoms of hepatitis C but the damage the virus can do to your liver as it goes undetected can be life-threatening. People can be exposed to hepatitis C in a number of ways, including having a blood transfusion before the early 1990s, having medical treatment or a tattoo abroad or via injecting-drugs use.

Getting yourself tested has never been easier. Free and confidential tests from the NHS are now available online. If you’re worried about hepatitis C, get tested, get treated, get cured.

The move comes as part of the latest Public Health Responsibility Deal pledge that aims to encourage action across the food industry to help increase the amount of fruit and vegetables - including fresh, frozen, canned, dried as well as juices - used in pre-prepared food, such as ready meals.

Eating 5 portions of fruit and veg a day helps to lower the risk of serious health problems, such as heart disease, and some cancers. But figures show that two thirds of people aren’t eating enough fruit and veg.

Public Health Minister Anna Soubrysaid:

“Through the Responsibility Deal we have already achieved real progress in helping people cut the calories and salt in their diet.

“All of the major supermarkets have now committed to removing artificial trans fats and over 70% of fast food and takeaway meals sold on the high street have calories clearly labelled.

“This pledge is part of a wider government plan to encourage everyone to eat their 5-a-day, which includes our £10 million investment in the Change4Life campaign and the 2.1 million children who receive a free piece of fruit or vegetable in school everyday under our scheme.”

The 16 leading supermarkets, food manufacturers and trade bodies, that have signed up to the pledge include ALDI, Co-operative Food, Iceland, LIDL, Morrisons, M&S, Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Waitrose, General Mills, Mars, caterers 3663, Brakes, CH & Co Catering, Subway and the British Frozen Food Federation.

**Chair of theResponsibility Deal Food NetworkDr Susan Jebb said: **

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/eu-cap-reform-proposals-should-go-further,Press release,EU CAP reform proposals should go further,Working towards a simpler CAP that provides real benefits for the environment and improves the competitiveness of the farming industry.,"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs",13 October 2011,"The European Commission’s proposals to reform the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) need to go further in order to deal with the twin challenges of international food security and protecting our wildlife and biodiversity, Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said yesterday.

The UK wants farm subsidies to steadily reduce in order to improve value for the taxpayer and help farming become more competitive to meet future demand for food as the global population increases. But the Commission’s proposal yesterday is based on a CAP budget frozen for 2014 to 2020, at £47 billion a year.

Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said:

“We’re pleased that the European Commission has at least listened to the message from the UK that the CAP has to do more to help the environment, and that its budget cannot keep increasing in the midst of an economic crisis.

“But while some of the Commission’s rhetoric is right, overall we’re disappointed and the proposals as they stand could actually take us backwards. So the UK will be working hard with the Commission, European Parliament, and other Member States to achieve the best deal for farmers, taxpayers and the environment.”

The UK also wants farmers’ valuable protection of the countryside to be better rewarded through targeted payments. But the Commission said it instead wants to pay only for basic measures, which would achieve far less and could impose pointless bureaucracy.

Negotiations will begin next week at the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council. The UK will now be working to help the European Commission realise the ambition of a simpler CAP that provides real benefits for the environment and improves the competitiveness of the farming industry.

Plans are expected to cut the time taken to record a right of way by as much as several years, so that routes set to be lost in 2026 can be preserved.

All unrecorded footpaths and bridleways created before 1949 cannot be recorded after 1 January 2026. This ‘cut off’ date by which to claim these historical rights of way was set in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.

As well as making it easier for walkers, horse riders and cyclists to protect unrecorded rights of way, the proposed system is expected to save almost £20 million a year by cutting needless bureaucracy.

No changes are being made to the protections for rights of way; rather proposals have been made to make the process of recording or changing them more efficient.

Landowners’ applications to move a right of way will continue to be approved only if they do not affect the public’s enjoyment of it, in which case it will be more straightforward for landowners to see them through.

Under logical new plans, paths and trails that are used by the public will be easier to protect, whilst redundant routes and unsubstantiated rights of way claims will be prevented from getting in the way of farming and business interests.

Environment Minister, Richard Benyon said:

“Footpaths, bridleways and trails are the life-blood for many rural communities, providing access to our world-renowned landscapes. Our changes will help protect access  for the thousands of people who walk, ride and cycle in the countryside every week.

“Protecting and improving access to the countryside is the latest in a programme of Government measures to grow the rural economy.

”These routes have huge benefits to the health and wellbeing of those that use them and can help stimulate the local economy, bringing in more visitors to enjoy rural areas.”

A £2 million grant fund has opened for applications from local communities today to improve access to rural areas in ways that will grow the regional economy.

The Paths for Communities initiative is part of the Government’s £165 million Rural Economy Growth Review announced in November 2011.  Local volunteer groups are invited to bid for funding to create new rights of way or increase the accessibility of existing ones.   This may include making rights of way accessible for horses and bikes, improving way marking, creating maps and making better links with local transport services and tourist destinations.

The proposals in the rights of way consultation are based on recommendations from a Stakeholder Working Group, which issued the following statement today:

”We welcome this consultation package, which builds on the Stakeholder Working Group recommendations, and are keen to continue to work constructively with the Government throughout the consultation and implementation process”.

The 31 awards include funding for 4 newBiomedical Research Unitswhich specialise in dementia research.

It is the UK’s largest ever investment in early stage health research.

Prime Minister David Cameron, said:

This unprecedented investment into the development of innovative medicines and treatments will have a huge impact on the care and services patients receive and help develop the modern, world-class health service patients’ deserve.

A strong competitive science and research base is a crucial part of securing sustainable economic growth and creating jobs of the future, and we have some of the best scientists and facilities in the world. This investment will help ensure we continue to be at the cutting edge.

Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said:

We want to ensure we can give NHS patients the very best possible treatments and health outcomes. To do this we need to give British scientists the means and tools to develop ground breaking world class health research.

That’s why, as part of our £4 billion investment in Research and Development, we have committed £800 million for translational research - developing exciting new science into tangible, effective treatments that can be used across the NHS. This will help deliver real improvements in patients’ chances of surviving and living a more independent, healthier and better quality of life.

Dementia research also features strongly in the programme of funding announced today. Dementia is one of the most important issues that we face as our population ages. We know it can have a devastating effect on peoples’ lives so it is essential that we develop new treatments to help NHS patients and their families.

This record investment, part of our essential modernisation plans, will secure the NHS as a world leader in translational research, as well as helping to ensure we give patients the very best treatment possible.

Chief Medical Officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies said:

The National Institute for Health Research centres and units announced today have been selected because of the world class quality of their translational research. By focussing on translational research across a wide range of diseases, the centres and units will help pull new scientific discoveries into benefits for NHS patients. I believe they will make a significant impact on the health of the population.

Sir John Bell, president of the Academy of Medical Sciences, said:

The NHS in England has become one of the best environments in the world for undertaking cutting edge translational research. This is creating real opportunities for improving the health of patients, as well as positioning the UK as a preferred site for clinical development by the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. Much of this capability is the result of careful and strategic investment in research infrastructure by the NIHR. The Biomedical Research Centres and Units are an excellent example of this investment and have transformed the relationship between hospitals and the research community.

At the same time, Health Secretary Andrew Lansley announced today that the NHS will take forward plans to widen access for more cancer patients to molecular tests, which uses genomic technology as a tool to provide targeted treatment for the individual patient. Testing of tumours and patients will be able to tell clinicians in advance whether a patient is likely to respond to particular drug therapies.

The report by the independent Human Genomics Strategy Group makes six recommendations to government:

Read Building on our inheritance: Genomic technology in healthcare.

Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said:

‘The promise of genomic technology, with its capacity to improve our understanding of the nature of disease and how our genes can inform our response to therapy, is immense but as yet developmental. The ability to use molecular testing of cancers to match individuals to the most appropriate treatment is revolutionary.

‘The new developments can help patients to get the best treatments to improve their chances of survival and their quality of life. I am very pleased to announce that we are going to develop a new commissioning and funding structure for molecular tests for cancer. This means there will be a formal structure - led by the NHS Commissioning Board - which will mean that more cancer patients will get access to these tests.

‘We want to make sure that all patients can benefit from these tests - as soon as the tests are recommended by NICE. We have therefore been working to establish a new system to ensure speedy introduction of high quality tests. This is the way forward for the future.’

Chair of the Human Genomics Strategy Group, Professor Sir John Bell said:

‘Genomics expands our knowledge beyond single gene analysis to the whole genome, increasing our ability to gauge an individual’s risk of disease and support better diagnosis and treatment. The UK is a leader in genomic research.

‘The Human Genomics Strategy Group want to see this position maintained - and built upon. This will take a concerted effort from all the key players in research, academia, industry and the NHS.

‘Adopting the recommendations in our report would lead to further revolutionary developments in our ability to diagnose, treat and prevent disease, and I urge the Government to consider these.’

There are now genetic tests for more than 1,000 diseases, including sickle cell anaemia, cystic fibrosis and some forms of cancer, available via the NHS.

The independent cross-government advisory group was set up in response to the 2009 House of Lords report on genomic medicine. It draws on expertise from across Government and research institutes. The Government will respond to its recommendations in due course."

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-divorce-law-to-end-the-blame-game,Press release,New divorce law to end the blame game,New legislation to overhaul divorce law and reduce family conflict.,Ministry of Justice,9 April 2019,"Divorcing couples will no longer have to blame each other for the breakdown of their marriage as the Justice Secretary today (9 April 2019) announced a new law to help reduce family conflict.

The move follows a public consultation where family justice professionals and those with direct experience of divorce voiced their support for reform. New legislation will therefore be introduced to Parliament to update our 50-year-old divorce law which has been shown to exacerbate conflict.

Ministers are acting to change the law after responses also revealed that the current system can work against any prospect of reconciliation, and can be damaging to children by undermining the relationship between parents after divorce.

Justice Secretary David Gauke said:

Hostility and conflict between parents leave their mark on children and can damage their life chances.

While we will always uphold the institution of marriage, it cannot be right that our outdated law creates or increases conflict between divorcing couples.

So I have listened to calls for reform and firmly believe now is the right time to end this unnecessary blame game for good.

Aidan Jones OBE, Chief Executive at relationship support charity, Relate said:

This much-needed change to the law is good news for divorcing couples and particularly for any children involved. The outdated fault-based divorce system led parting couples to apportion blame, often resulting in increased animosity and making it harder for ex-partners to develop positive relationships as co-parents.

As a large body of evidence shows, parental conflict is damaging to children’s wellbeing and chances in life, whether the parents are together or separated. It’s good that the government has listened and taken action on this, demonstrating commitment to reducing parental conflict.

While divorce isn’t a decision that people tend to take lightly, we do support the extension of the minimum timeframe which will allow more time to reflect, give things another go if appropriate, and access support such as relationship counselling or mediation.

Current laws demand proof that a marriage has broken down irretrievably and force spouses to evidence ‘unreasonable behaviour’ or years of separation, even in cases where a couple has made a mutual decision to part ways.

Marriages are not saved by the ability of one spouse to ‘contest’ a divorce in court. Very few divorces are contested but this practice is known to be misused by abusers choosing to contest a divorce purely to continue their coercive and controlling behaviour. The government therefore proposes to remove it.

Proposals for changes to the law include:

Starting a minimum timeframe at the initial petition stage reflects consultation respondents’ views that couples ‘feel divorced’ when the court grants the provisional decree of divorce (the ‘decree nisi’). This will provide a meaningful period of reflection and the opportunity to turn back. Where divorce is inevitable, it will better enable couples to reach agreement on practical arrangements for the future. Courts will retain the power to expedite the process where appropriate.

These reforms retain what works well in existing divorce law and remove what stands in the way of resolving difficulties more amicably when a marriage has irretrievably broken down and requires an orderly, legal ending. The new legislation is expected to be introduced as soon as Parliamentary time allows."

The meeting was chaired by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, and the European Commission Vice President, Maroš Šefčovič, alongside the co-chairs of the Committee, the Paymaster General, Penny Mordaunt, and Michel Barnier. Representatives from the Northern Ireland Executive and the EU 27 Member States also joined by videolink.

This meeting was an opportunity for both parties to set out their positions. Vice President Šefčovič detailed the European Union’s concerns, and requested that the UK withdraw the UK Internal Market Bill.  The UK Government made clear that the legislative timetable for the Bill would continue as planned.

The UK Government reiterated its commitment to implementing the Withdrawal Agreement, including the Northern Ireland Protocol. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster updated the Committee on the significant steps already taken to implement the protocol, with investment to support Northern Ireland businesses and new IT systems. The UK Government also stressed its obligations to the citizens of Northern Ireland, its determination to uphold the constitutional status of Northern Ireland within the UK, and its responsibility to provide good governance for the whole United Kingdom. As co-guarantor, along with Ireland, of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement, the Government’s commitment to that agreement remains absolute.

The Protocol makes clear that Northern Ireland is fully part of the customs territory of the United Kingdom and that there will be unfettered access for goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of the United Kingdom. It is essential that, in the implementation of the Protocol, nothing undermines those fundamental principles.

Accordingly, the measures set out in the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill are designed to create a ‘safety net’ that ensures ministers can always deliver on their obligations and take steps to best ensure the prosperity and protect the enormous progress the people of Northern Ireland have made in recent decades.

The UK Government underlined its determination to continue to engage in Joint Committee discussions constructively, with the aim of finding a satisfactory outcome for both sides."

The Transport Secretary has today (8 September 2023) announced funding of up to £129 million to help local transport authorities introduce hundreds more zero emission buses.

These new buses will help grow the economy by connecting communities – helping people get to work or college while also providing a boost forUKmanufacturing.

To make sure more parts of England benefit from green technology, particularly remote areas where building the infrastructure needed for the buses is more expensive, the government has prioritised the first £25 million for rural communities.

TheZero Emission Bus Regional Areas (ZEBRA) 2 schemeis now open for bids from all local authorities in England (outside London), with applications to be prioritised from those that did not receive funding in the previous funding rounds to ensure more people can enjoy this clean transport.

The Transport Secretary has also announced today the launch of a new research hub, backed by £10 million in funding from the Department for Transport, National Highways,HS2Ltd, Network Rail andUKResearch and Innovation (UKRI).

Newcastle University, Heriot-Watt University, University of Cambridge and University of Glasgow have been awarded the funding to establish the Net Zero Transport for a Resilient Future Hub, where they will develop innovative ideas to ensure future transport infrastructure is low-carbon and resilient.

Transport Secretary Mark Harper said:

Todays’ funding for more zero emission buses will help decarbonise public transport and grow the economy by keeping our communities connected. We have already reached our initial target of funding at least 4,000 zero emission buses and this additional funding will improve journeys for even more passengers, reaching those in the most remote areas.

TheUKis also cementing its position as a world leader in net zero tech with this new investment into climate resilience. Our Net Zero transport hub will be a centre of academic excellence, helping us keep our transport network resilient into the future.

Bus Minister Richard Holden said:

It’s been fantastic to be at Alexander Dennis and see how our £129 million investment will impact British bus manufacturing.

This brings our total investment in new zero-emission buses to almost £500 million, helping to kick-start a new generation of bus manufacturing in theUKand create good, high-quality jobs from Scarborough to Falkirk.

We’re leading the way by ensuring that Britain can take advantage of high-skill manufacturing while delivering cleaner public transport for passengers across the country.

This second phase of theZEBRAscheme builds on the success of the first round of funding, through which 1,300ZEBswere funded.

Through millions of pounds of investment, the government has succeeded in meeting its initial target of funding 4,000ZEBswith this latest funding announcement bringing the country closer to a fully decarbonised fleet.

This comes on top of £3.5 billion already invested in improving bus services since 2020. The government recently announced a£500 million boost to cap fares at £2 until the end of October 2023, and then £2.50 until November 2024, as well as protect routes into 2025. This is helping people save money on travel and improving transport connections to grow the economy.

Alexander Dennis President and Managing Director, Paul Davies, said:

It has been a pleasure to welcome the minister to our Scarborough factory, which is a prime example of how government investment in zero emission buses can support communities across the country when it benefits domestic manufacturers like ourselves.

We provide thousands of skilled jobs and apprenticeship opportunities in an industry that is firmly looking ahead to a sustainable future for us all.

Our next-generation electric buses are ready to support councils’ZEBRA2 bids, including the innovative Alexander Dennis Enviro100EV, which is particularly suited to efficiently provide zero-emission mobility for rural communities.

Alison Edwards, Confederation of Passenger Transport (CPT) Director of Policy, said:

We welcome the government’s announcement of further government funding for zero emission buses. Buses have a huge role to play in helping theUKmeet its decarbonisation goals.

We are pleased that the prioritisation of rural bus services in the bidding process recognises the challenges facing these operators. To help tackle these,CPThas established a Rural Zero Emission Bus Taskforce, which will seek to identify practical solutions that are required for rural areas.

Funding for the research hub will be used to develop new ways of modelling cities and towns, and understanding how vital structures such as bridges and rail lines can handle severe weather events such as flooding. The hub will work with local authorities and industry to identify practical opportunities to make it easier for people to travel with greater choice and less disruption.

By establishing the technology in theUK, the research hub will directly create new research jobs and build the talent base by providing upskilling training to develop a highly skilled workforce.

Professor Miles Padgett, Interim Executive Chair of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, part ofUKRI, said:

A well-functioning low-carbon transport infrastructure is vital to sustain communities and economies.

This investment in the climate-resilient development of our transport system will keep theUKat the forefront of the green industrial revolution and accelerate the transition to a secure and prosperous green economy.

Professor Phil BlytheCBE, Professor of Intelligent Transport Systems and head of the Future Mobility Group, Newcastle University, said:

We are delighted to be awarded the hub, which will be the national focus for research into how we decarbonise and make resilient our transport infrastructure.

The hub will engage widely to bring together the leading academics from across theUKand their civic and industry partners so we can focus on understanding the underpinning science and engineering to enable us to tackle these real challenges and provide the models that will help us understand the impact and find the most appropriate solutions.
